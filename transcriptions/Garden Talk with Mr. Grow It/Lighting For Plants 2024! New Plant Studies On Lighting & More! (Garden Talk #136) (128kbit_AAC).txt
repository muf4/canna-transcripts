[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast where
we interview growers from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, both beginners and experts seeking
to learn more about what they know about
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening and how they do things in their
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're tuned in to the Garden Talk
podcast, this episode number 136.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Shane from
MiGrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on the podcast once before,
episode number 33, back in 2021,
[SPEAKER_00]: where he talked all about LED grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will continue to talk about lighting in
this episode, diving into topics such as
[SPEAKER_00]: enter canopy lighting, DLI, light quantity
instead of quality, and so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: These podcast episodes are broken up into
short clips, and they get placed on their
[SPEAKER_00]: own dedicated YouTube channel called

from My Grow LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Chris, doing very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming back onto the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were on the podcast in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: So several years ago, that was episode 33
and 110,000 views on that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember we had so many good topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about a whole bunch of different
things that were lighting related.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about grow light testing,
the different colors, and the light
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum, diodes, drivers, and so much
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are tuning into this podcast
episode and missed that episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: highly recommend you go back to that
episode at some point, maybe after you're
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to this one, go back to that
one, tune into it, and there's a lot to be
[SPEAKER_00]: learned there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll link it down in the YouTube
description section below like I usually
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode, we're going to get into a
variety of topics, mostly lighting based.
[SPEAKER_00]: More, I would say, on the intermediate or
advanced side of things, but I'm sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: beginners will be able to grasp on some of
these things and they'll have some
[SPEAKER_00]: takeaways as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd mention that before we
get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I wanted to ask you if you can
introduce yourself for those that didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: catch the first episode we did together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Shane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I own a company called Migro and
predominantly make and sell LED grow
[SPEAKER_01]: lights, but also run a channel called
Migro across YouTube, Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook, TikTok.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I try to cover all topics
related to grow lighting, try to do kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a scientific informative channel with
lots of tips and how tos and tests and
[SPEAKER_01]: comparisons and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I've been doing it for seven or
eight years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just getting to find my feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you've been doing a great job over
several years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that plaque behind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means you must have passed 100,000
subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dive into some topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the topics that I want to start
with is kind of a hot topic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interkenopy lighting is becoming more and
more popular these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some say it's worth it, while others say
it's a waste of energy and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is interkenopy lighting and what is
your overall thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so our typical sort of
traditional lighting is from above.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'd have your grow tent,
you'd have multiple plants in your tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically you try to grow a plane of
green, a sea of green, so that it'll like
[SPEAKER_01]: a solar panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll capture all the photons from the
light source and, of course, convert it
[SPEAKER_01]: into energy and into growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening now is that I suppose the
boundaries are starting to be pushed in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of how much light the plants can
take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to push that to its extreme,
people are starting to use interkenopy
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting, which would be lighting that
would be positioned either down the side
[SPEAKER_01]: or underneath the plants and basically
lighting it from below or from the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the theory is that you can get more
growth out of the same square footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can increase your yield per square
foot by adding additional lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath and that's the side,
as they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And would you say it's worth it to do that
or would you say it's not really worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really see much of a gain from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to take it one small
step back and that other research has been
[SPEAKER_01]: showing recently that plants can absorb
more light than we previously thought,
[SPEAKER_01]: in particular medicinal herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically, you know, right way back
when you're growing with HBS, we would
[SPEAKER_01]: have been delivering somewhere around five
to six hundred micromoles of PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a measure of light intensity that
plants can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the increased usage of LEDs,
in particular the reduced heat from LEDs,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're kind of able to put a lot more light
into grow areas now without the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have been pushing that up to
about eight hundred or nine hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: micromoles, so nearly twice as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's over the last three or four
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the most recent sort of study and
practice by commercial growers and people
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing the performance of the plants,
I found that you can comfortably go up to
[SPEAKER_01]: about twelve hundred micromoles on a 12
hour cycle, which is about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's nearly 50 percent more again than
about two and a half times what we used to
[SPEAKER_01]: only five or six years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one way of achieving that,
particularly if you have invested in a
[SPEAKER_01]: system of lighting from above,
which is delivering, say, that average of
[SPEAKER_01]: about eight or nine hundred, is to add
additional light fixtures underneath and
[SPEAKER_01]: on the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that case, if your per square
footage of micromoles is hitting about
[SPEAKER_01]: twelve hundred, that's a good return.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could push it a little bit higher than
that, but you're starting to get a reduced
[SPEAKER_01]: rate of return.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more light energy you're putting in,
the plants aren't able to absorb all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think there's huge potential
for growers to basically push to get 50
[SPEAKER_01]: percent more yield from their same area
that they're growing in today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be completely transparent with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did try sidelighting several years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chilltech came out with two different
ones, actually, and I tried using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just a small home grower,
so I'm only really growing for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yields I get just naturally with
overhead lighting is sufficient for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I quickly used and then got rid of
my sidelighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see how it would be a benefit for
commercial facilities or those folks that
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you are a home grower and maybe
you've maxed out that grow space and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've gotten the highest yields you think
you can ever get out of that grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, introducing that might be for you to
introduce intercanopy lighting at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for somebody like me, who's a small
home grower, I don't see myself ever going
[SPEAKER_00]: back to intercanopy lighting just because
I'm able to get what I'm looking for in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to yield just from overhead
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, mention that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would tend to agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for most growers, I would only
recommend that sort of 800 or 900 average.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I designed my lights is to
deliver that, because the analogy that a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people use is this sort of driving
a Ferrari, you know, that when you start
[SPEAKER_01]: to get up to those really high par
numbers, the difficulty is if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: bottleneck somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if some other part of your either your
environment control or your nutrients or
[SPEAKER_01]: even your growing medium is not able to
support that growth rate, then you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to deliver it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd be I'd be on I'd be right there
with you that for some growers who who are
[SPEAKER_01]: able to push that performance and want to
push it further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: For most, I wouldn't recommend it either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, your plan is only going to grow as
fast as your limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most folks, their limiting factor
is CO2, which we're going to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: later on in this talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, I would like to dive into DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So break it down for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is DLI and what's the target for
those growing medicinal varieties?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So DLI is simply the sum of light the
plant will receive over a light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we're talking about parts,
micro moles, you know, the units can get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you go back to what I was speaking
about earlier about this sort of 800 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 900 micro mole average that most growers
are growing at today, that equates to if
[SPEAKER_01]: you multiply that 800 by the time in the
day, literally the amount of seconds in
[SPEAKER_01]: that day, you'll get the micro mole
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you multiply the 800 by 60 seconds,
by 60 minutes, by 12 hours, and you get
[SPEAKER_01]: around 35 moles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another way of looking at your
your light intensity is how much the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants receiving over that that life
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I was saying earlier, new studies
are showing that you can probably push
[SPEAKER_01]: that up to about 60 moles per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So almost double what we're doing at the
moment without needing to have any sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: sophisticated environment controls such as
elevated CO2 or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's a very high power
intensity, very high amount of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants can absorb and medicinal herbs
are an exception in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, tomatoes, which are known as
chilies and those sort of plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: known as very highlight demanding plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, commercial growers wouldn't push
them beyond about 40 moles per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it shows that medicinal herbs really
have a unique capability of absorbing a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of light and converting it
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which is, as I said, it could be could
be a real benefit for growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly in a smaller area where they
want to push production, higher production
[SPEAKER_01]: out of a small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And DLI, you mentioned the calculation and
just for reference, folks can Google DLI
[SPEAKER_00]: calculator and you'll be able to easily
find several websites that actually have a
[SPEAKER_00]: calculator on there we can put in the
inputs and then it will spit out what the
[SPEAKER_00]: result is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on one of them right now and I just
wanted to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a PPFD 900 time I put for 12 hour light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you calculate that, that's a 38.88 DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are going to 18 hours per day,
right, still 900 PPFD, you're up to a 58.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're close to that 60 that you
mentioned for DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: What really throws people off,
I think, is auto flowers, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: is because they're on the same light cycle
the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet we hear about you needing to increase
light from the vegetation stage to the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, right, let's say that you
are on an 18 hour light cycle and that you
[SPEAKER_00]: are you keep it on 18 hours and you bump
it up to 1200 PPFD, right, because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: running CO2 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're at a 77 DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beyond the 60 that people are kind of
getting away with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard some people go up to 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, a lot of people are
falling into the trap of light stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're just going by PPFD,
not taking DLI into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then their plants are suffering
because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend folks play around
with that calculator, kind of see what
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD you're giving the plants and how many
hours and calculating it and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing where you're falling in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it can certainly be kind of
surprising once you once you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: calculator involved.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to say with auto flowers,
so typically growers would probably run
[SPEAKER_01]: for about 20 hours per day light cycle,
leaving three or four hours for for a
[SPEAKER_01]: night period for the plants to rest and
recuperate between between light cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would generally recommend about 550
micro moles in that case, which is pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: up to about 40 DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also with with the discussion about
vegetative and flowering and moles per
[SPEAKER_01]: day, I would say that push the plants as
hard as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you have a light that's
capable of delivering a thousand,
[SPEAKER_01]: twelve hundred, whatever it is,
get it up as high as you can, as early as
[SPEAKER_01]: you can, even through the veg stage and
just look for signs of light stress,
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure at the same time that you're
keeping up with the demands of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's going to aspire more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to basically need more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to need more nutrients because
it's growing faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to be careful not to misdiagnose
light stress with possibly some other
[SPEAKER_01]: factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, back to the sort of reference
points.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're talking about running at
900 micro moles average per the sun is
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000 midday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants are well able to take very high
power intensity without being damaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you are running them,
as I said, at a very high performance
[SPEAKER_01]: level, other factors may come into it and
you may be restrict them in other ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of fresh air or elevated CO2 and
being very careful with that you get them
[SPEAKER_01]: enough water that you keep the humidity
down because it's going to be respiring a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot and keep the nutrients up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good call outs there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like quantity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the density of photons coming down
onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's light spectrum,
often referred to as light quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light spectrum is often a main focus point
when shopping for a grow light,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But some claim that the priority should
really be light quantity instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the density of photons versus the
spectrum of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I would agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of, you know, these power
photons that we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in the range between 400 and 700
nanometers, strictly speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's blue, green and red photons,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if all of them are present,
you're going to get white.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get white light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most LEDs these days are white LEDs
supplemented usually with 660 nanometer
[SPEAKER_01]: reds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those reds are sometimes confused as being
somehow they promote flower or they force
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant to flower or they make it flower
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason we add the 660 nanometer
reds is because they're highly
[SPEAKER_01]: electrically efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means they deliver a lot of photons
per watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can think of them a bit like a
little photon turbo that you'd have in
[SPEAKER_01]: your lighting system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We add as much as we can afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're much more expensive than white
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they'll give it that, as I said,
that boost in terms of efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's lots of evidence has accrued
now with published studies showing that
[SPEAKER_01]: you could have a range all the way from a
very warm white spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So similar to what HPS would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quite a small proportion of blue,
a lot of green and a lot of red.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have a range from that spectrum
all the way up to a very cool white,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would have a lot of blue in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So up around the 20, 25%.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that would have been typical in
metal halide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will get almost no difference in
terms of growth rate and you will get no
[SPEAKER_01]: difference in terms of quality of harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the potency of what's harvested will be
exactly the same irrespective of which
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum you choose in that range of
spectrum available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has very little difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of that, there are arguments about
the spectrum of light can affect not just
[SPEAKER_01]: the growth of the plant, but the shape of
the plant and the characteristics of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some belief out there that,
for example, far red again can do
[SPEAKER_01]: something special in terms of the way the
plant develops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And far red typically can cause plants to
stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Far red is very you get very high levels
of far red in shade in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would signal a plant to get out
of the shade and into the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a shade avoidance response it
causes, and it can cause plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be useful in early stages of
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you want to get that canopy out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get that plant to extend,
to fill up the surface area of your tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: to expand that solar panel out and gather
all the light from your grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some cases, there may be an argument
for using far red at early stages to
[SPEAKER_01]: promote that sort of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's discussion around UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, not typically present in your
standard LED grow light, but you can
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement it with special fixtures,
which would have UVB and UVA.
[SPEAKER_01]: UVA performs a little bit like blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some evidence that it may help
strengthen your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can strengthen the cuticles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the little parts where the branches
come off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And make them a little bit stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants are less likely to,
the branches are less likely to snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And UVB has been shown to, in some cases,
not all cases, to cause, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's kind of known colloquially as a
sunscreen response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is for the plant to produce more
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be in the form of terpenes
and flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you get more sticky harvest
with higher levels of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So better taste and smell with terpenes
and flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is evidence of that in a lot of
strains, but there's also evidence that
[SPEAKER_01]: with some strains that you don't get that
response by using UVB.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would generally, again, if you're
going for your basic standard home grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say just get, don't worry too much
about spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much all grow lights these days are
using the same spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for a reason, because it works for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't fuss about it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's much more important is the PAR
intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the amount of light that the
fixture is delivering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just look at the, a grow light
manufacturer should be providing a PAR
[SPEAKER_01]: map.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they should be showing the PAR
distribution over its specified area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say it's a 750 watt light going into a
five by five.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should show that light and its optimal
hang height over a five by five space and
[SPEAKER_01]: give you a grid showing the PAR intensity
right across the area of your target plant
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should look for even distribution
and high intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if folks really want to get down to
the nitty gritty of the individual light
[SPEAKER_00]: in the light spectrum and how they impact
a plant, we covered that in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So highly encourage you guys to tune into
that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: After this one, because Shane breaks it
down everything from blue, red,
[SPEAKER_00]: UV, IR, all that stuff has broken down and
how it impacts the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, really great talk there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just want to mention that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing in the last garden talk
episode that you talked about is that was
[SPEAKER_00]: back in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had mentioned that back then grow
lights had enough far red in them that
[SPEAKER_00]: there really isn't a need to add
additional far red, like supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel that's still the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same case here in 2024?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since then, there's more evidence has
come out that far red is photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the photons beyond that strict power
range of 700 nanometers up to about 750
[SPEAKER_01]: nanometers, they cause photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they cause photosynthesis at a
lower rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're less efficient in terms of
causing photosynthesis than, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: red or green or blue photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So investing and spending extra on
additional far red LEDs within a fixture,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my view, is a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not getting the growth and the
yield return from that extra investment
[SPEAKER_01]: that you would by just simply buying a
fixture with more white LEDs or red LEDs,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other factor is that pretty much
all white LEDs, they have a little tail of
[SPEAKER_01]: far red just at the end of their spectrum,
typically about two or 3% far red in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you really desperately want to have
far red for some reason, there already is
[SPEAKER_01]: some there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, if you do add too much far
red and that it's a trade off here,
[SPEAKER_01]: by the way, or it's a balancing act
between blue and red.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if blue will cause short dense growth,
far red will cause stretching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a lot of blue,
you can afford to put a lot of far red in
[SPEAKER_01]: there because the far red shouldn't cause
stretching in that case.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't have a lot of blue and
you put too much far red in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: red in there, you'll have stretched
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an inefficient way to grow
because really what you want is flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And putting energy into more stocks and
more leaves and sort of more height is a
[SPEAKER_01]: waste of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, in my view, I don't think
there's a strong argument for adding far
[SPEAKER_01]: red LEDs to a fixture whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it can actually make it a
little bit more difficult to grow just
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've got those long stretchy
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once the buds kind of build up on it,
it could become so heavy that they just
[SPEAKER_00]: start flopping over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens with a lot of OG strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I battled that in the past where I had to
put support stakes and then tomato cages
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be a challenge when you have
those long stretchy, that long stretch in
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, getting those heavy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a little bit challenging on that
avenue.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I remember back in the HPS days and
I'd switch over to HPS and then it was
[SPEAKER_01]: just a eight week battle for trying to
control everything and trying to,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you say, tie everything down and get it
away from the heat and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we have really good spectrum now
with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can tailor it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not mess it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you touched upon UV lighting and you
kind of answered the question I'm about to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to ask it a little more
direct, which is you mentioned that with
[SPEAKER_00]: the far red it's not really worth adding a
supplemental lighting in your opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that's the same for UV?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there enough UV light in most fixtures
these days that it's not really worth it
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy supplemental UV bars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't get any UV from white LEDs
or red LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the UV LEDs would have to be added in.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only really efficient UV LEDs in
the range, which is just below 400
[SPEAKER_01]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So around 385 or 390 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants see it as blue and it doesn't
affect either the growth very
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not very photosynthetically
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not going to add to your yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to add to your growth rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's yet to be strong evidence that
it has any significant health benefit for
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants or in terms of potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: UVB is slightly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: UVB is not really achievable using LEDs,
at least not commercially viable now yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically people would use fluorescence
to deliver UVB.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a very cheap and efficient way
of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is strong evidence that it will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my experience is going to a commercial
grower actually in the UK and it was with
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal herbs for CBD varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was actually a Canadian parent
company which was trialing the UC UVB.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were demonstrating in some cases
up to 40% increase in terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were using it for oil extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's obviously very commercially
beneficial for them to be able to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot higher extraction rate from the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in some strains they saw very little
response.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's a fairly cheap addition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very cheap to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd need approximately about 20 watts
of fluorescent in a five by five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be to deliver a UVB
intensity of about half what midday sun
[SPEAKER_01]: would be outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for a couple of hours a day in
the last few weeks of flowering to
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulate that response in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anecdotally, a lot of customers,
I sell one so this comes with a warning
[SPEAKER_01]: but I get a lot of customers anecdotally
coming back to me and saying they've had
[SPEAKER_01]: good results with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had some say they haven't had any
result at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends, it's strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any data on which ones
respond and which ones don't and why.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there definitely is cases where it can
be a pretty efficient and cheap way of
[SPEAKER_01]: boosting the quality of your harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it makes sense that the strain
would be dependent on the strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants have so many different
varieties and they react so differently to
[SPEAKER_00]: all the things that we throw at them,
whether it be lighting or whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment or whether it be the
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the way the plant expresses
itself, I can imagine that it's different
[SPEAKER_00]: for each cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a commercial disc facility that I
travel to, they're also selling to
[SPEAKER_01]: supermarkets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were selling basil, rosemary,
sage, all these different herbs for
[SPEAKER_01]: supermarkets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biggest response they were getting
was actually from rosemary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may know yourself, like I've got a
little herb garden at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows under sort of a little plastic
kind of greenhouse we have at the back
[SPEAKER_01]: garden in the winter just to keep it away
from the frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until that is brought out into the sun
and hardened, as gardeners would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you won't get that stickiness on the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs that UVB to stimulate the oil
production as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do actually see it in particularly
at wintertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I buy rosemary from a supermarket,
it'll be sort of a dry, almost leathery
[SPEAKER_01]: surface to the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than that sort of sticky,
gooey surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because it's grown inside in
greenhouses and UVB doesn't transmit
[SPEAKER_01]: through the glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, from a commercial point of
view, there are a lot of facilities which
[SPEAKER_01]: are installing UVB into their facilities
to supplement the light that's coming
[SPEAKER_01]: through the glass and deliver UVB to
stimulate this oil production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to shine away from talking about
light for a few and talk about some other
[SPEAKER_00]: things that relate to growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I want to get into is
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've been doing some experiments or
research into supplementing CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about your findings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, on a personal basis, I have failed
dramatically in all my experiments to
[SPEAKER_01]: prove the benefits of CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't yet had firsthand experience
of seeing the benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had it in the early stages of
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've done it with chili plants and I've
grown side by sides, same strain of
[SPEAKER_01]: chilies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cuttings in the same media,
same environment, one with elevated CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: and one without.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I saw in the early stages was
definite increase in growth rate in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of vegetative stage for the chili
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I saw that once it started
flowering and fruiting, that advantage or
[SPEAKER_01]: that increased growth rate seemed to come
back to reduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've failed publicly doing that on a
few grow comparisons I've done online.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, people who are much better than
me and more capable than me have grown,
[SPEAKER_01]: in particular, Dr. Bruce Bugby and Mitch
Westmoreland in Utah State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the very few people actually
published their results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, again, growing with medicinal
herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've shown that there's an up to
30% increase in growth rate if you elevate
[SPEAKER_01]: the CO2 level from what's in the
environment, which is about 420 parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million, up to about 1200 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all other things being equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are in the fortunate situation
where you can have a closed environment
[SPEAKER_01]: for your grow room, you can potentially
use what is a fairly cheap input,
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using a hot burner, basically a little
gas pilot burner to produce the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can use it cold from basically a
bottle of compressed CO2 you can get from
[SPEAKER_01]: a welding suppliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do it in two different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And potentially, it's a very cheap input
to get a big increase in growth rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants don't use a huge amount of CO2 in
terms of mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could, for example, be using a
bottle of propane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mice cost 20 or 30 dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be feeding your grow room for
the three or four months that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: running a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could be getting an increase in
growth rate potentially of 30% for 20 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a huge potential there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difficulty is for small growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It adds a level of complexity because if
you are running a CO2 burner, it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to add heat to your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also going to add moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get CO2, but also H2O when you burn
the gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to have environment
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be able to take that humidity
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't want to be expelling the CO2
that you're producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to have basically air
conditioning system set up where the air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning is of the more sophisticated
kind, where the radiator is outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: either the grow room or the lung room,
which is out of a higher technical level
[SPEAKER_01]: than a lot of people are willing or able
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I wouldn't be advising people
to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want more growth, maybe just add a
little bit more area to your tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe push power intensity a little bit
higher or even just change the medium that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using to a more efficient medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of other ways to get an increase in
growth rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you've explored all those
options and you really want to push it
[SPEAKER_01]: further, it definitely has potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've played around with adding CO2 off and
on over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've used everything from those CO2
mushroom bags to the TNB natural canisters
[SPEAKER_00]: that you shake up every day and put on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of companies out there
making good CO2 monitors where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: measure result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's not a direct CO2 sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really understand the technology,
quite honestly, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: sensors around now and you'll see them
online as air quality sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're able to detect CO2 levels
pretty accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get them for about $100.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the measurement is getting easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, what we were talking about
earlier about light stress, I think in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of cases, it's potentially actually
the plants are being starved of CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it would be quite useful,
particularly with large growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be sort of eight by eight tents and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got dead areas in that tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to move around the air
sufficiently that you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: replenish the CO2 in every place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would recommend for those who are
sort of pushing the limits to if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: invest in a CO2 sensor and just keep an
eye on it because it could be a
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictive factor for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a CO2 monitor by the company is
actually called CO2 meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an older one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably about this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe for those just listening in,
it's got to be about six inches roundish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is something that I've been
using, but I'm not in a sealed room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like me using the CO2 canisters
and using the exhale bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's up and down result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every time I went in there,
it would be to be elevated 700,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it would be normal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, it's just so hard for me to
measure it as a home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned in the beginning,
I don't need the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's situational.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I bring this up is I think
it's situational.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people hear about these things
that help with growth rate and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, and they automatically apply it in
there because they feel like they need to,
[SPEAKER_00]: but look at your own personal goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're already achieving the yield and
why bother investing into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing folks don't really realize
is if you're a home grower, like me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're exhaling CO2, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like CO2 levels, every time I go in
there, it's elevated just because I live
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a fiance lives here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a daughter now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all exhaling CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's contributing to my grow room and
the plant growth that's happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I mentioned those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's fantastic that we're
finding out all these things about CO2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's increasing that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm totally with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to get it up to that
next level, add CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not for everybody is what I feel
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did do a test of those mushroom
bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did one literally today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just posted one today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Company wasn't happy with my previous
test, sent me another one to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found out the same thing that,
you know, this is one of these,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got straw and mycelium in it and you
blow air through it and you get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they'll elevate it for a short
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in a sealed tent, but it drops
away pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really the only way effectively to do it,
as I said, is with a burner or with CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those other methods are not very
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you uncovered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad there's guys like you that are
actually doing studies on it to see
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not it works or if we're
actually being fed snake oil here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snake oil, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's transition over to temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So temperature within the plant's
environment can greatly impact growth
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about crop steering with
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, again, fascinating research coming
out of Utah State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: I interviewed both Bruce Boopy and Mitch
Westmoreland, two people I've been working
[SPEAKER_01]: on with very sophisticated equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: To test, to control tests of varying
different environmental factors and seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: what effect they have on both growth rate
and yield and quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And temperature is particularly difficult
to do because you have to have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions, but in separate rooms with
environmental control and quite expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: to do as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done really extensive testing on a
number of different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've demonstrated, there's two
parts to it, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, it is generally between
about 20 degrees centigrade, so about 68
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit and about 26, 27 degrees
centigrade, so about 85 Fahrenheit is
[SPEAKER_01]: optimum for growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you increase it in that range,
you will get a higher growth rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the general idea is to start warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to get, again, get those
plants to put out their canopy as quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get them to get up to as large
a size as possible before you flip or
[SPEAKER_01]: before they start to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, once buds start forming,
buds are peculiar in that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively like a ball of leaves tightly
packed together and they have a difficulty
[SPEAKER_01]: in losing their heat and also losing
moisture, so respiring, because there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: large density and a small surface area
rather than a leaf, which is a very low
[SPEAKER_01]: density and a high surface area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these buds have a difficulty in getting
rid of heat and respiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, buds tend to be at the top and they
tend to absorb that bit of radiant heat
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from, in particular, if you're
using HID, they can be three, four degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: centigrade, five, six degrees Fahrenheit
higher than the temperature of the room,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're absorbing that heat,
but they're not able to expel that heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is advised now is to reduce down
the temperature down around 20 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: centigrade or 68 Fahrenheit, at least to
that point, the second half of flowering,
[SPEAKER_01]: if not earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once those buds are starting to form
and become dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they've shown through extensive
studies is that if you do run hotter than
[SPEAKER_01]: that, there's a very steep drop-off in its
ability to retain cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So effectively, the quality of your
harvest will reduce if you're running too
[SPEAKER_01]: high a temperature in the latter half of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really dramatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it's a little bit layered
because it does depend on strain and
[SPEAKER_01]: different strains tolerate different
ranges of temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a five degrees centigrade
range of tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some will prefer it to be 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will need to be down to 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: To retain that potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go from, say the optimum in
terms of retaining potency is at 20
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees centigrade, if you go to 25,
it can drop by over half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have a 50% reduction in the
potency of your harvest if you're running
[SPEAKER_01]: five degrees warmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Than the optimum for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quite dramatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something that I used to hear a lot
anecdotally from growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd often hear, I get a much higher
quality harvest in winter, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: In summer I struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an underlying reason for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's now evidence to support that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting and very useful for
growers to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Difficulty for growers is another layer of
difficulty for them is trying to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature down in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trying to get it down to 20 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people's homes will be over 20
degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be 22, 23 degrees where we find a
comfortable 70, 75 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it needs air conditioning effectively
to cool it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not possible for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some fairly easy methods of
at least being on the lower end or as low
[SPEAKER_01]: as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is operating your light
schedule at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your house, the air you're pulling in
from outside, if you are, that will be
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives you a better opportunity to
bring that temperature down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And high rates of airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do want humidity to be down as well
in that second part of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are doing that, you're probably
pulling through air pretty quickly through
[SPEAKER_01]: the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore keeping the temperature
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not possible for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I would say is just try and keep your
temperatures as low as possible for that
[SPEAKER_01]: phase of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, 68 degrees Fahrenheit for the second
half of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably eye-opening for a lot of
people listening to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard about lowering the temp towards
the end of flowering, the final couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like you mentioned, the higher the
temp, the more terpene loss and flavonoid
[SPEAKER_00]: loss that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just evaporating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 68 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 10 degrees lower than what was
genuinely recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: By me too, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would have been recommending that
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Higher temperature up to very recently
until I got this new information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those studies are not actually fully
published yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the guys in Utah State have
released the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mitch Westmoreland from Utah State has
done a few podcasts, including my own,
[SPEAKER_01]: where he's shown his results with two
different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the evidence is plain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the quality going up, yield has to
go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it measured how much of a yield loss
there is running that lower temp?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't fully understand this,
and I'm not going to pretend to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I gathered from what I was told
is that there's two things working against
[SPEAKER_01]: each other or for it, whichever way you
look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the relatively lower temperature in
flowering is it actually promotes the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to push resources basically into the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may not get a total massive plant
at the end, but you're pushing the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to put its energy where you want it to,
which is into the flowers with that lower
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is less of an effect once you
get into that sort of 20 to 26 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: centigrade or sort of 268 to 7580
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference in growth rate between the
lower and upper range there is not huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not losing that much in terms of
mass of plant by reducing it at that
[SPEAKER_01]: stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, it's on balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's far more beneficial to have a lower
temperature than a higher one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to seeing the final
results on what they come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into measuring light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few questions for you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lumens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is measuring lumens beneficial at all or
should growers stop measuring lumens
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people used to use lumens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not anymore, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said before, as in the particles
of light that cause growth are in about
[SPEAKER_01]: the range of 400 to 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're more or less absorbed equally
within reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So blue, red, blue, green and red photons
are absorbed at a very similar rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the eye and look sensors,
they are much more sensitive to green than
[SPEAKER_01]: blue or red.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will see green more effectively
than they will blue and red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having said that, you know, I wouldn't
discourage somebody from using a lux meter
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're trying to particularly look at
intensity across their grow area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using a lux meter will show you the
relative values of light intensity across
[SPEAKER_01]: that grow area very accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to, for example,
look to see what your intensity is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: corners or if you've got a large grow area
and you've got your mapping out lights and
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to cover your canopy evenly,
using a lux meter is a perfectly good
[SPEAKER_01]: solution for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see what your actual power
number is, there is a correlation between
[SPEAKER_01]: what a lux meter will read and a power
number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a factor you can multiply
the lux reading by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a blog on my website and on the
YouTube channel showing you how you can
[SPEAKER_01]: use a lux meter to measure power
effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you measure lux and then just multiply
it by number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also use it in conjunction
with an app.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're on Android or iOS now,
actually there's an app called the PPFD
[SPEAKER_01]: app.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a guy I've worked with a little bit
in the past and he's, you can pair what is
[SPEAKER_01]: a cheap and readily available lux meter
called the unit T.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Bluetooth version and you can
pair that to the app and you'll get at
[SPEAKER_01]: least 95% accuracy in terms of the power
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tested it with various different
light sources extensively and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also a number of apps you can
use with your phone too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, was the Photon app?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember, they changed it to,
I can't remember, it was called the Photon
[SPEAKER_01]: app but there's one on iOS which is quite
accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to use basically a piece of paper
over the front camera as a diffuser.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you basically just sellotape a little
bit of paper over the front camera on your
[SPEAKER_01]: iPhone and you can use that as a power
meter and it'll be perfectly adequate for
[SPEAKER_01]: most home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the PPFD app, you can do the same now
across Android and iPhones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's relatively easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other sensors, I've just done an
extensive test of six power meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comparing the Lycor, which is like the
industry standard $1,500 one, with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Apogee, which is like the $600 one,
with the Spoton, which is the $350 one,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the Photon, which is the $160 I
think, and a couple of other ones which
[SPEAKER_01]: were cheaper and not very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those higher priced ones, the
difference in accuracy between the $1,500
[SPEAKER_01]: meter and the $160 meter is only about 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're growing at home,
95% accuracy on a power meter is all you
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do it for 160 bucks,
buy them on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Hydrofarm Photo Bio Power Meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanna get a little bit more
accurate, you can use the Spoton,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, again, I've used here
extensively and on you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you only really need to be spending
big bucks if you're a commercial grower
[SPEAKER_01]: and 5% means something to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise you can do it pretty cheaply and
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to see that there are more
affordable options coming onto the market
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to measuring light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, she's warped back five years ago
and Apogee sensor was the cheapest you
[SPEAKER_00]: could get, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit the $600.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two different models of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first they were only, what,
$400 to $700.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they came out with the one that
extends beyond that, because we found out
[SPEAKER_00]: that PAR extends a little bit beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's really good to see that
they got the Spoton meter, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other ones you mentioned,
actually using your phone to get an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of what the light levels is, even if it's
only 95% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: For all intents and purposes, you're able
to adequately and reliably measure light.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to use it, though, is the next thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where people come a little bit
unstuck, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I got a little tutorial on using a
YouTube channel about using PAR meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really what you want to do is,
first of all, measure your center point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most lights are going to have higher
intensity in the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even LED bar lights in around the center
is going to be higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to trade off dropping your
light as low as possible to get as much
[SPEAKER_01]: light down onto the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the lights are very high,
light will bounce around and be lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll go every other way except hitting
the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting it down nice and low is very
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dropping, for example, from about 24
inches down to about 12 inches will
[SPEAKER_01]: improve the amount of light, even with
reflective walls in a grow tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: by about 10 to 15%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get real benefits or
improvements in efficiency by optimizing
[SPEAKER_01]: that light height.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're checking the center measurements
and then just checking the corners,
[SPEAKER_01]: really, the corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: The corners and the edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's no point in getting really
high light intensity in the center of your
[SPEAKER_01]: tent and then all the plants around the
periphery are suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to do that trade off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally, I would say you're trying
to get in the corner about half the
[SPEAKER_01]: maximum number in the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not possible to get 100% uniformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't try.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's OK to have that fall off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll fall off fairly gradually to the
edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're getting 50%, 60% of the
intensity in the center out in those
[SPEAKER_01]: corners, you've pretty much got it
optimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much PAR in PPFD do you generally
recommend for the different stages of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth when growing medicinal varieties?
[SPEAKER_01]: So very young plants, seedlings,
you can push it very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't advise it again because you're
stressing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're delicate and they could be
quick to turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things can go bad pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be quick with a little seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally, I recommend 250 to 350
micromoles for seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that plants up to about two,
three weeks old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So until they're like sort of six inches
high, you're kind of getting little woody
[SPEAKER_01]: branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got maybe four or five branches
coming out on top of each other stacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: From then, it's push them as hard as you
can, as quickly as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all strain dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try not to give a definite number.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you should be trying to get up to full
PAR intensity by week six, somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: around that region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from two or three weeks old,
you should be pushing that light intensity
[SPEAKER_01]: up incrementally to at least 80% by week
six and possibly by 100% strain dependent,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you need to do is just keep an eye out
for light stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And light stress, we get a lot of people
as a grow light supplier, we get people
[SPEAKER_01]: coming back saying, oh, my plant is
burning my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell them unless the plant is within six
inches of the light bar and you're at
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%, it is not light burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have grown plants within four inches at
100% where it's 3000 micromoles directly
[SPEAKER_01]: under that light bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still not light burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to get up to that sort of at
least above two and a half thousand,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 3000 micromoles before you start to
see actual light burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll know it because it'll only be
on those spots which are very close to the
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be all across your canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite often, I'd see people would send
me in pictures to sort of diagnose what
[SPEAKER_01]: the problem would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that all of the plant is
affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just these little peaks here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your canopy is perfectly flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not all getting exactly the same
light intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are seeing spots directly under
the light or where the light is emitted
[SPEAKER_01]: directly under the bars, very close to the
bars, that probably is light stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And raise the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raise it six inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just be sure that you're not causing
that plant damage or bend that particular
[SPEAKER_01]: part over or trim it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very rare that you would get
light stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's far more likely that you're going
to see other symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be symptoms as a set of
underwatering, overwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of what I see is too much nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to diagnose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, over a WhatsApp message or an
email photograph, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from what I... When I go through all
of the different factors that the grower
[SPEAKER_01]: has in place, quite often, in my view,
it's actually too much feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked you this next question in our
last episode back in 2021, and it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: three years later now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I forgot to ask you again, what does
the future look like for grow light
[SPEAKER_00]: technology?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think as you were saying earlier,
I think some of it will be about our
[SPEAKER_01]: growing systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll be having systems which
understand and support higher growth rates
[SPEAKER_01]: overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are dialed in to the sort of 12,
1400 micromole average.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just over in MJBizCon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met you there and I was talking to a lot
of commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There and that's pretty much or sorry,
grow lighting suppliers selling to
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty much what they're
specifying now is 1400 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because they're getting a good
return for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's the best use of the space
and they're getting a good return.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's almost twice the power intensity
that home growers are using today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, if we figure out what
strains are best suited, if we figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: what sort of nutrient schedules should be
used, what sort of watering systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: what sort of media, et cetera,
best support this high performance level,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's perfectly achievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as as it would be a
surprise to people six, seven years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: who were running with metal halide and HBS
that were pushing, you know, in some
[SPEAKER_01]: cases, twice the yield per square foot
that they would have been even expert
[SPEAKER_01]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of this increase in light
intensity, I think they would be
[SPEAKER_01]: surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we'll be equally surprised
three, four years from now when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking back and seeing all these little
incremental sort of changes that have
[SPEAKER_01]: occurred to put systems in place to
support that higher return rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm trying to look into the future
myself and see what is next for grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that come to mind
that I'd like to see and I think it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be achievable in the future is having AI
incorporated a little bit directly within
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow lights to where it can actually
scan the plants and find out, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll automatically adjust the light up to
where it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it's smart enough to know that
there's deficiencies, well, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate to you and let you know that
you need to increase your nutrients or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it probably could happen at
some point in the future, maybe not in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next couple of years, but maybe five,
ten years from now, we've got AI
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporated directly in the grow lights
to where it's actually adjusting the light
[SPEAKER_00]: levels according to how the plants
physically are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a really good example of that and
just cheap sensor technology that works
[SPEAKER_01]: really well and takes it away from sort of
our perception or whatever our experiences
[SPEAKER_01]: are before that may be misleading us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the ones for me is moisture
sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I was growing in Cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually met Dr. Cocoa over in MJBizCon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was giving it to me because I hadn't
been following his methods properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he was suggesting the same
thing to me about using the moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say, I was overwatering and
I didn't realize it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and sensor technology is getting cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The integration of these sensors is
getting cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm really impressed with
AC Infinity stuff, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: where they've really brought the price
down for integrated sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've brought those systems together for
the home grower and made it much easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: use and taking it away from our
subjectivity, from our sort of biases
[SPEAKER_01]: based on past experience and or just lack
of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so whether it's helping you
with nutrition and feed schedules,
[SPEAKER_01]: helping you with, you know, controlling
your environment, dialing all those little
[SPEAKER_01]: factors in.
[SPEAKER_01]: To, you know, prevent us making a mess of
things for a start, which is always a
[SPEAKER_01]: bonus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, you know, getting those extra
five percents all over the place,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, those little five percents that
all increment together to make a good grow
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than a disappointing grow,
which, you know, we've all had those
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences where, you know, we look back
and we're just not sure what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're just not sure why it went
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was different?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I did everything exactly the
same and it turned out different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we had, as you say, AI knitted into
that where, you know, we're able to feed
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs and outputs into a system where
we're diorizing things effectively online
[SPEAKER_01]: or through these through these devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's huge potential there to
prevent disasters or disappointments and
[SPEAKER_01]: to boost performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it can be really helpful for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will just have to wait and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Jane, I have taken up enough of
your time, but I want to let the listeners
[SPEAKER_00]: give them an opportunity to follow you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell listeners how they can find
you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever platform you're on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, I'm on Migro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just look for Migro or MigroLite at
MigroLite across YouTube, Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: TikTok, Facebook on the website,
MigroLite.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of blog posts there with lots of the
things we've just discussed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as much information as I receive,
I put out there as quickly as I can,
[SPEAKER_01]: as concisely and accurately as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so hopefully, you know, you find that
a good reference point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're selecting GrowLites,
it's got a lot of comparisons and reviews
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of setup and optimizing,
using parameters, all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: all covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and I'd love to get your
feedback too, as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look at as many comments as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I answer as many of them as I can,
and I listen as much as I can to people
[SPEAKER_01]: and try to provide them with the
information that they want and need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to Shane's
channel down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're on one of the podcast
platforms, just listening, search for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll show right up once you Google Migro,
both his website and channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to pass a question off to the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last question I asked you was,
what's the future of GrowLiting
[SPEAKER_00]: technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to hear what the audience is
saying about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have any input, if you have any
thoughts on where GrowLite technology is
[SPEAKER_00]: going, drop them down in the comments
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to read those.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing to mention would be the
other episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll link it on the outro card,
which should be on the screen right now if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're tuned in on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So click that right there and you can tune
into the last episode Shane and I did
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane, thanks so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
Bye.
