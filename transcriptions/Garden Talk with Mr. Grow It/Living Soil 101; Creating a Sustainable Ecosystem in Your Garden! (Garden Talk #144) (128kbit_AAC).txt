[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, for those of you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 144.

[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming onto the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk all about living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is an area that you have many,
many years experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really excited to have you on the
podcast today to get deep into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you give us an
introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Joshua Steensland and I've been
cultivating plants and tending gardens
[SPEAKER_01]: since about 1997 when I got out of the
Marines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really had an itch to get involved
horticulturally with all kinds of plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants, veggie gardens,
the works, and really just kind of hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground running.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been cultivating pretty much
continuously since 97.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I first came across you in 2016,
if I remember correctly, came across your
[SPEAKER_00]: content, I was like, man, this guy is
really good at dialed in and you were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing organics and living soil back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've been so many years experience
here doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many years have you kind of had your
feet wet with living soil in particular?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, ironically, I think you probably
came across me right around the time I was
[SPEAKER_01]: first discovering and sharing my process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before about 2016, I would cultivate in
many different styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to own a couple of brick and mortar
hydroponic shops or garden centers in
[SPEAKER_01]: Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that afforded me the opportunity to
try lots of different cultivation styles,
[SPEAKER_01]: aeroponic, deep water culture,
recirculating deep water culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa, the works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had been in the middle of lots of
different transitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a really bad run with a popular
nutrient brand that I won't name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just kind of fed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I hit the ICMAG forums and I saw a
picture in a post of probably the most
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful plant I had ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the caption underneath the picture
was, this plant was grown with nothing but
[SPEAKER_01]: water and its own shade leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just gobsmacked, completely
blown away at how that was even possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went in, I just dove deep into the
rabbit hole I started with the sub cool
[SPEAKER_01]: super soil type blend and then really dove
head first into and a huge shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeremy at Build a Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: His website was really and still is a vast
resource for knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially in those early days,
there was not a lot of people talking
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really gave me the confidence to
kind of jump in with both feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I decided at that time to just
document my journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can watch like my first 12 cycles
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might only be 10 on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just kind of documenting my journey
and really got to watch the living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology take off over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel fortunate to have been in a unique
position to kind of watch this rebirth of
[SPEAKER_01]: these old school cultivation techniques
that are being embraced in all different
[SPEAKER_01]: sectors of horticulture and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of history there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I first started,
I started with a synthetic bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and slowly transitioned over to
the organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like the past 10 years in
particular, there's been a large
[SPEAKER_00]: transition from using bottled nutrients to
organics, living soil, no to living soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative, gardening, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is bent by living soil to say all
that your organic gardening or your living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and what's the difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Break it down for us.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So living soil, you know, there's life
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in the worst, like dusty dirt that
has no organic matter, there's still
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria that are present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything is really alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people get confused with like,
what does this living soil mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And really horticulturally speaking,
it's having not just bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: but fungi, protozoa, micro arthropods,
worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're having a whole consortium of
biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Lane refers to it as the soil food
web.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend folks going down that
rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a living soil system, we're paying
as much or more, frankly, attention to the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil than we are our actual the crop that
we're trying to grow or trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's practices that can do to help
increase the biological diversity and the
[SPEAKER_01]: quantity of biology in your soils to
really help facilitate that nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: cycling process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really all about biology in
diversity and in the correct quantities in
[SPEAKER_01]: order for it to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would kind of be a quote unquote living
soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone were to use organic inputs,
for example, they add in organic inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do that initial mending to begin,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they add in microbial inoculants,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be considered a living soil
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do they also need worms and they need
to use compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: And where's like the line, I guess,
when it comes to true living soil versus
[SPEAKER_00]: just growing organically with organic
inputs, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a that's a kind of a hard
distinction to make because there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of gray area on the lines outside of these
definitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think for me personally, and I've
really struggled hard with trying to not
[SPEAKER_01]: be an absolutist in this in this game,
because first off, that can come across as
[SPEAKER_01]: holier than now or can come across as
like, oh, we know everything when really
[SPEAKER_01]: we just know what we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we share my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't say that my definition is the
absolutist definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the most most people in the
living soil community would agree that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so many different ways to tackle
fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't poo poo on people who use
organic amendments or even even organic
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of soluble nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're still paying attention
to the soil biology and you're not doing
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that's a detriment to the soil
biology, you can still amend.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still foliar feed with your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do all kinds of different things
outside of just tending to soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: putting worms and using water only,
which happens to be kind of my minimalist
[SPEAKER_01]: approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't use a lot of top dresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when other people do, I don't say,
oh, you're not living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as long as there as long as if
worms can live in your system and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not killing your worms, then you've got a
living soil system, to be frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are the they're like the canary in
the coal mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will scram.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything's weird, they will scram.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will not survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're if if what you're doing,
if the variable that you're adding to your
[SPEAKER_01]: system, it makes it to where you can't
have those that kind of life in your
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would start to question whether you have
a living soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for breaking that down for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's an area where there's
so much confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I think that that distinction
needs to be made because a lot of folks
[SPEAKER_01]: have this really absolutist approach and
this kind of all or nothing approach when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to regenerative agriculture in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be off putting to people who
are trying to get in, who are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: just trying to understand the system and
trying to convert maybe a salt system into
[SPEAKER_01]: a living soil system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to know that you've gotten
flexibility and leeway with how to how to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply these techniques and still and still
qualify as a living soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does the overall health and
productivity of plants grown in living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil differ from plants grown in other
systems, such as synthetic nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's another great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, with hydroponics and
salt based systems, you get very rapid
[SPEAKER_01]: growth, especially in the vegetative stage
of certain plants that you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very fast, very fast growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's your only metric for success
or for plant health, then that then that
[SPEAKER_01]: really kind of keeps people in that,
you know, in that system because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, my plants grow very fast and
they look very green and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's your only metric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that tends to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in an organic system, you might get a
little your veg time might be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the overall health of your plant is
going to be the same or better than a salt
[SPEAKER_01]: based system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just based on my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know plenty of my friends and plenty of
my very good colleagues.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow using salt based nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've just done it forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got their systems dialed and
I'll still smoke their material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got many friends that grow in with
salt based nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have no problem going over to their
house, eating their fruits and veggies
[SPEAKER_01]: because I know that they're doing things
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're flushing things properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not they care about what
they're putting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about what their end product is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again, I'm not an absolutist in
that sense where I just if people aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in living soil, then I'm shaming
them or or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think I think there's plenty of
room for everybody to cultivate,
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate the way they're comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my experience happened to have
experienced a greater degree of success
[SPEAKER_01]: and a higher level of quality when going
the organic route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that debate is going to be
going on for many years from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's better living soil or growing with
synthetic inputs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not something we're really going
to get deeper into in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have other episodes where we kind of get
deeper into the differences there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your thoughts on on the differences
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into soil microbiology next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get deeper into that and how it
works in living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you able to kind of break it down for
us how different microorganisms benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm no Dr. Elaine, but I think I've got a
pretty good grasp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did her foundation course and
found it really, really beneficial for me
[SPEAKER_01]: to connect some of the dots as far as what
I was experiencing with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant health and plant fertility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and so the takeaway with the biology
is once again, as I referenced the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: food web earlier, if you just have
bacteria in your system, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere, bacteria is literally
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I remember right, it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're finding bacteria that survive on
the outside of the space shuttle when it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes into the vacuum of space in the
Mariana trench of the really hot vents.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just bacteria everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not really concerned about our
bacteria levels as long as there's not bad
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we really want to see,
and especially in row crops, vegetables,
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants, those type of things,
we really want a one to one bacterial to
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hard part for a lot of soils and
agricultural soils is getting the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter up to the level where you can start
to increase fungal diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And aerobic fungal diversity specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, if you have a system
where you have plenty of bacteria and
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi, you might think that you've you've
made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be honest, that you're all of your
nutrient, that the bacteria and fungi are
[SPEAKER_01]: mining from your organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully you have beautiful
agricultural soils with lots of organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the bacteria and fungi might
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bacteria and fungi can combine
minerals and nutrients that they in turn
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that nutrient and mineral can
get locked up in the living bodies of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there needs to be a predator,
a higher order predator in that system
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of facilitates their demise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really want the protozoa in there
to get at the bacteria and fungi and then
[SPEAKER_01]: will now in turn release some of that
soluble nutrient that's going to be right
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of around the rhizosphere of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant works in conjunction with the
biology to get what it needs without
[SPEAKER_01]: getting too specific and drilling down
into some of the specifics.
[SPEAKER_01]: A byproduct of photosynthesis in the plant
creates carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is so intelligent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the ability to formulate that
carbohydrate from moment to moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at night it sends it back down
into the root zone and that those exudates
[SPEAKER_01]: cover the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on the formulation of the
exudate, it attracts whatever biology has
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant needs a very specific
micronutrient and it already knows that
[SPEAKER_01]: the biology that likes that micronutrient
and has it stored in its bodies likes this
[SPEAKER_01]: specific configuration of carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It attracts it to the root zone and then
the soil food web does its thing and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is kind of released in a
soluble plant-ready form there at the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important not just to have
bacteria and fungi, but it's important to
[SPEAKER_01]: have the protozoa as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: To help release that trapped nutrient and
mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the way up the micro
arthropods and all those other things,
[SPEAKER_01]: those just work on your organic matter and
they have waste products that are
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial to the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really just like you want to see in
nature, you want to see a diverse
[SPEAKER_01]: population of life flourishing in your
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have that, then you know you're
kind of working in accordance with nature
[SPEAKER_01]: and the way plants work with soil is so
supremely designed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unbelievable how amazingly adept and
the plants are at feeding themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not need our help.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not need us in there fidgeting
around with things for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you have biology, organic
matter, moisture, sun and a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to do its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to know and trust that
process and that comes with experience and
[SPEAKER_01]: just really just doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned protozoa and I feel like a
lot of folks will rely on micro products
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to kind of enhance the
microbiology in their soil, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like a lot of these micro
products don't have protozoa in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you happen to know why?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think because they're a little bit
larger life form and a little more fragile
[SPEAKER_01]: than the... So say like a bacteria have a
really good ability to kind of preserve
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves if they get into a dry or a hot
or undesirable condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them have a way to just kind of
like go into like a suspended animation
[SPEAKER_01]: and then when the moisture content is
correct again, they'll come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Protozoa don't really have that ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a little more fragile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think amoeba will go into like a
testate form when they get shaken up,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't think that they're very
tolerant of drought or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their kind of fragility lends to them
being the kind of the first ones to go
[SPEAKER_01]: when you have a systemic issue or a crash
or you let your system dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the wonderful thing about that is that
all you have to do is get your system back
[SPEAKER_01]: into balance and get your organic matter
right, get your moisture right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Protozoa will arrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just arrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have any kind of compost or
vermicompost, there's tons of protozoa in
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do a thermophilic compost,
there's gonna be tons of protozoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen the Johnson Sue kind of
bioreactor material under a microscope,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've heard lots of really good things
about that composting process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's ways to just kind of
reintroduce them into your system at
[SPEAKER_01]: random intervals or at intervals to ensure
that you're kind of keeping your protozoa
[SPEAKER_01]: and your bacteria to fungal populations
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know if a lot of people know
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you're adding in worm
castings, you're adding in protozoa as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about micro products?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we kind of talked about that a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people do rely on micro products
to inoculate the medium with microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the diversity there is pretty
limited, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you could go out and do the IMO
process and get more diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of talk to us about the
difference between inoculating with a
[SPEAKER_00]: micro product versus the IMO process,
maybe some of the pros and cons to both of
[SPEAKER_00]: them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look, I think there's a lot of kind of
what are lovingly referred to as bugs and
[SPEAKER_01]: a jug products out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my very basic kind of rudimentary
understanding of this, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: pretend to be the expert in this,
but my basic general understanding is that
[SPEAKER_01]: you do better in your cultivation system
if you can gather those microbes kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: regionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're very limited,
like you said, to a very specific type of
[SPEAKER_01]: biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they might not be suited for
your region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you're end up doing is you
just end up applying a bunch of biology to
[SPEAKER_01]: your system that just ends up being food
for your native biology, which causes a
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom in biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, oh, wow, the products
work great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if that's one of the functions of
those products, then that still
[SPEAKER_01]: technically works, maybe just not in the
same modality that people are thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're applying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, based off of the schooling,
the stuff that I learned at the Soil Food
[SPEAKER_01]: Web School was a lot of those bugs and the
jug recipes have some kind of acid in
[SPEAKER_01]: there to stabilize, to make it shelf
stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can have a negative effect on
your native biology as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always just tried to avoid those
products and work to cultivate that
[SPEAKER_01]: biology on my own property or in my own
region, once again, via thermocomposting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never done IMO collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know lots of people who do, lots of
people who really have found great success
[SPEAKER_01]: taking bits and pieces of the K&F
practices and applying them to their
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think obviously one of the most
successful things that you can do outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of like FPJs and stuff is that that IMO
collection technique is really stellar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really, I'm really intrigued by that
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really like to see people follow
through with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just I've never done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've focused more on the vermicomposting
side and the thermophilic composting side
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the bio complete compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've just had great success.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that and just felt like if I'm
getting the biology into my system this
[SPEAKER_01]: way, I just really didn't need to venture
into that other technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I encourage people to try
as many of these techniques and find out
[SPEAKER_01]: which one scratches your itches,
which one feels good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of people are A type and they like to
be busy and they like to do things and
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like they're participating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more of a hands off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to just kind of set it and forget
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to spend hours in my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to just go in and look at it like
things are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to apply compost to my,
to my beds twice a year, or maybe even
[SPEAKER_01]: just once a year and just kind of leave it
at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't fuss over things, but if
there's people who are like super A type,
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage them to check those things
out, try the things, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: build the cedar box, take it out to the
woods, do, do all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I'm sure it'll feel great and
you'll get great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had the chance to do the IMO
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just like you have been focusing on
vermicomposting and I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are under the, you know,
having the misconception that if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not doing the IMO process and you're not
doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's just the wrong way to
think about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are other ways to get to the
finish line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned the vermicomposting,
that's another way where you can create
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, get biology, maintain and take it
from your vermicompost system and then put
[SPEAKER_00]: it into your garden, whether it be an
outdoor garden or indoor garden with grow
[SPEAKER_00]: pots or containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are multiple ways to get to that
goal of increasing the microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: population in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's some really good info that
you shared with us right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad you expanded on it and
mentioned it in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into building soil from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of folks that are just
getting started and they want to start off
[SPEAKER_00]: with a living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your recommendations?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should people use for materials in
order to start to build their own living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think there's a couple of ways
that you can tackle this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could build your own and that's,
I highly recommend people venture into
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really gets you more connected to your
system and gets you more familiar with
[SPEAKER_01]: sourcing the ingredients and understanding
how difficult that could be sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can go through a company like Keep
It Simple or any of these other build a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil that have these really great kind of
custom blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of those are based off of the
Coote's recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if many of your growers would
be familiar with Clackamas Coote or many
[SPEAKER_01]: of your viewers would be familiar with
Clackamas Coote.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been a little less vocal on social
media over the past five years or so,
[SPEAKER_01]: but early on around the time I first
started Come On, his soil blend or soil
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe had become very, very popularized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most living soil blends you're going
to find here in the States are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: basically a variation of the Coote's
recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's changed a little bit over the
years and some people like Mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics have really kind of tweaked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a one third compost, one third
aeration and one third peat or cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are still using
peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never done cocoa in a living soil
blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some unique differences
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that being your base,
you add your nutrients and minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where things get interesting
because people take that recipe and do all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of things with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just use like Mountain
Organics for a while was just using
[SPEAKER_01]: glacial rock dust at like four cups per
cubic foot of base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was doing great with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just doing amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you could look at that Coote's
base and then just add kind of mess with
[SPEAKER_01]: it and add things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a crustacean mix you can add.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got kelp, all these different
things that you can add to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to have some fun and get
acquainted with putting those systems
[SPEAKER_01]: together is really good and beneficial for
your cultivation journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have time or patience for
those things, like I said, just getting
[SPEAKER_01]: into a reputable company that's been
producing soil for living soil cultivators
[SPEAKER_01]: for years, literally a decade or more,
some of these companies, you can't go
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with any living soil recipe,
most of the time nutrients are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: deplete, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless it's quote a super soil to where
it's a water only recipe, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, it's going to depend on how
long you veg the plants for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of them you can just do an
initial mending and then you just water
[SPEAKER_00]: only for the rest of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other recipes, which a majority of the
recipes, the nutrients are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: deplete at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those recipes, what organic inputs do
you typically add in throughout the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when do you add them in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this tends to be a very hotly
debated topic amongst agronomists and
[SPEAKER_01]: especially large scale agriculturists and
horticulturists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a differing opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two trains of thought when it
comes to fertility and available
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to kind of briefly describe the
two different camps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's kind of three, but there's
one that's in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the far off to one side, I don't want
to say right or left, far off to one side
[SPEAKER_01]: is the Dr. Elaine camp, which I tend to be
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that camp is based off of what I've
learned in going through her foundation
[SPEAKER_01]: course material and then also how that
information laid over my experience and
[SPEAKER_01]: really helped connect a lot of dots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so according to Dr. Elaine,
as long as you have adequate biology,
[SPEAKER_01]: once again, diversity and quantities and
aerobic, and you have adequate organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, that biology will be able to mine
whatever nutrient, whatever mineral that
[SPEAKER_01]: that crop needs, whether it's corn,
potatoes, medicinal plants, tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: herbs, any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her body of work has led her to the
conclusion that all nutrient needs for all
[SPEAKER_01]: plants can be met entirely and completely
with biology and organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you go by that, then really,
all you need to do is keep track of your
[SPEAKER_01]: biology, make sure that your biology is
flourishing and make sure you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: plenty of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you follow those two rules,
you'll be able to continuously crop
[SPEAKER_01]: without ever really having to amend.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes as far to say you don't even need
to get a chemistry analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when I say these words, I can see the
heads exploding in your viewership right
[SPEAKER_01]: now because there's lots of people who are
going to say hogwash and they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: fish at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me personally, I started not
understanding the soil food web,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just kind of trusting the process and
really wanting to see how little I could
[SPEAKER_01]: do, how minimum, how many variables can I
exclude from my system and still pull off
[SPEAKER_01]: a viable crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just a viable, but better than
average, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was experiencing that for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, you can go back into my
YouTube and look at my first six cycles
[SPEAKER_01]: and I talk about these very things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not in the over 10 years I've had
my beds in the soil that I've had now,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never done one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chemistry analysis on my soil and my yield
numbers are the same from day one from 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and all I've been doing for the
past about five years is just adding
[SPEAKER_01]: compost or vermicompost or some kind of
compost extract in my system to maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I know my system has plenty of
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can, you can take that kind of
ultra extremist biological approach to
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a testament to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've set up a commercial cultivation
facilities with the same ideology and they
[SPEAKER_01]: do great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done large scale outdoor fiber and
hemp crops that we've put nutrient blends
[SPEAKER_01]: in half of the acreage and then left the
other half of the acreage without any
[SPEAKER_01]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just water and native soil, which was
woefully inadequate with organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they produced the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yields were the same in one half of
the field to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were adding, it was costing $550 an
acre to add that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over a hundred acres, you know,
$55,000 that was not needed at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could have used that $55,000 anywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other half of the acreage that we
didn't put the nutrient mix on did exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could not tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, one field to the next one row to the
next.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that to me was spoke volumes about the
power of biology and the power of this
[SPEAKER_01]: soil web.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that being said, that doesn't,
that doesn't do it for some folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of folks that are so tied
into the, the chemistry part of it that
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to know the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the other side is the people
that completely ignore biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And only focus on chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you find that those are the people
that are using the salt based chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers and pesticides and all those
other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They live in that camp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somewhere in the middle is a guy named
John Kemp and, and he's his company is
[SPEAKER_01]: advancing ecological agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gigantic.
[SPEAKER_01]: He firmly believes in the biological
portion.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually been on podcasts with Dr.
Lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've had some really interesting
conversations about, about, about the way
[SPEAKER_01]: they're two different takes on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is not ready to just drink the Kool-Aid
and go 100% biology, even though he knows
[SPEAKER_01]: that the biology supersedes the chemistry
in any kind of cultivation system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biology will always supersede chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what he's done with a lot of
conventional ag, big conventional ag guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that he's come to the table and said,
Hey, look, let's focus on biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let's watch what happens to our
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's utilizing the data that
conventional farmers have relied on for
[SPEAKER_01]: generations or for decades, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This, this, this, this chemistry data and
exposing them to the biological data and
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, Hey, look what happens when we
marry these two, look at the changes that
[SPEAKER_01]: take place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's done a really good job at
convincing farmers that one, they can
[SPEAKER_01]: remove certain things from their system
because it's the, it's not beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the, the, the, the biology is
not present to process the raw amendment
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're putting down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just leaving money on the table or
you're literally letting it blow away in
[SPEAKER_01]: the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's combining these two
methodologies to really bring conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: ag into the fold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then where he differs from Dr. Lane is
that he says, Hey, look, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can, the natural order drive
cultivation and drive fertility,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you're producing a cash crop and
you were trying to maximize, you can drive
[SPEAKER_01]: that in an organic way while still keeping
in mind what's happening with your biology
[SPEAKER_01]: and not doing anything that's going to
have negative impact on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the years where I went from this
very hardcore Dr. Elaine purist,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, wouldn't even tell a client to
get a soil test or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I kind of understand the John Kemp
ideology, where it's really, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like let's, let's leverage the data that
most people are relying on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really want to see that chemistry
data and let's just kind of use that to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of prove the concept of what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can drive your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can drive your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Steve Cantwell, Good Lab
Productions, they do chemistry analysis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're still very heavily
biologically focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my colleagues, Matt Davenport
with Samada Designs, he's very much the
[SPEAKER_01]: same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he had his hand, he had a hand in
designing GOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so I've really kind of eased off
of that, that hardcore purist,
[SPEAKER_01]: not when it comes to my personal grow and
my personal grow, I'm still very hardcore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still don't do chemistry analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still don't top feed or top dress
anything that I think I might be missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just focus on my biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: My crops are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: My yields are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy camper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just doesn't cut it for other folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I work with somebody on a personal
basis, or I'm working with a client that
[SPEAKER_01]: has a commercial growth, I'll introduce
this kind of John Kemp or, or kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt Davenport or Steve Cantwell's kind of
ideology where, Hey, look, let's take a
[SPEAKER_01]: peek at the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see where we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's just make sure that we're at
those numbers, because that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody feel happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm not opposed to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have a lot of experience,
kind of a long way around to answering
[SPEAKER_01]: your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a lot of experience with
adding amendments to systems, because I've
[SPEAKER_01]: just been mainly focused on biological
driven fertility systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have no interest in, you know,
pushing my crop to yield 15% more by
[SPEAKER_01]: tweaking certain numbers not that it can't
be done, just have no interest in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had really a great level of
success, just kind of being on that other
[SPEAKER_01]: extreme end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that being said, there's lots of data
and information and, and podcasts that
[SPEAKER_01]: people can digest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I highly recommend John Kemp,
anything that he's got is just really,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned so much from his material
that it can scratch that itch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, if you're the A type,
that really likes to be in charge,
[SPEAKER_01]: and really likes to know everything that's
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a methodology and a template for
you to achieve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might be a bit eye opening for
some of the viewers here, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners here, when we talk about some of
these prominent figures, such as Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leningham versus John Kemp, who they've
got different insight and different data
[SPEAKER_00]: and different ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people reference Dr. Bruce Bugby,
and they say he's the end all be all is
[SPEAKER_00]: what he says goes and everybody else is
wrong, you know, but there are a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists out there that disagree with
his ways to go about it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Next topic we're going to get into here,
but I just have a follow up question for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the next topic, when we get into teas,
there's actually some pretty big
[SPEAKER_00]: disagreements in regards to some high
level scientists who disagree whether or
[SPEAKER_00]: not you should do teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into teas, you mentioned
you do compost only, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us some insight and just
like, how much compost and how often you
[SPEAKER_00]: apply it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with my, with my methodology,
it tends to be once again, frustrating to
[SPEAKER_01]: the A types, because I'm just really run
very intuitively.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fortunate enough to have a very well
established beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I before I moved to my new location,
my current location, about a year and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half ago, the beds that I had were in
three, four by eight by ones, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: were like eight years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very established beds, just,
I could put anything in them and they
[SPEAKER_01]: would just flourish and wouldn't have to
really do anything as long as the moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: levels are on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved into my new place and I had to add
about two and a half yards of new soil to
[SPEAKER_01]: the new beds that I built.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've kind of got like a layered system
where my upper part of my bed is the newer
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and the lower part is that older aged
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really have this benefit of having a
large storehouse of organic matter and
[SPEAKER_01]: biological activity deep in my bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could, I really feel like I could go
quite a while without ever having to
[SPEAKER_01]: amend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because look, if, if, if you're
cultivating in your system and it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: just sitting there, not doing anything,
then that cultivation process with
[SPEAKER_01]: mulching and living, if you've got,
if you've got companion plants or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or cover crops going, all of that is
contributing to new life in your system
[SPEAKER_01]: and sustaining the life that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could theoretically build a living
soil system and never really add compost
[SPEAKER_01]: ever, as long as you're cultivating the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, out in nature, in the forest,
there's nobody out there spreading compost
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just is kind of that, that,
that natural, natural humic layer is just
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's developed over time and you can build
that same type of system with your system
[SPEAKER_01]: and just kind of allowing the natural
process to build over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have major dry out events or
major flooding events or any of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those will be setbacks, but eventually
your system would build back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I do is I just kind of once or
twice a year, add compost to my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do take periodic microscopy readings
just to kind of analyze, make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, after doing so many slides,
you really just kind of know when your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil's on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I ended up getting, having an
overwatering event and I felt like I had
[SPEAKER_01]: an anaerobic pocket, I would, I would try
to analyze and make sure I didn't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogenic fungi or any of the bad,
bad biology present in the system that
[SPEAKER_01]: could have a deleterious effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really that's just, that's frankly,
that's never happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've, I've stopped using the microscope
almost entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think it's a valuable tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've built compost so much and I've,
my system is so stable that I just,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when I have good compost and I know
when my system is good and I just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: intuitively amend.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people aren't going to like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people's thought process
is that you're growing a plant and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're removing that biomass and all the,
you know, as the plant's growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously the nutrients being uptake about
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you remove that biomass,
you're moving the nutrients from the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when adding in more inputs is,
you know, a requirement really for,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the most part, it's not like the,
the out in the forest where nobody touches
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the leaves are falling down,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they break it down, but
everything's kind of being recycled within
[SPEAKER_00]: the same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're removing that biomass,
I think that's a concern for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where, um, trying to
wrap your head around and having a deeper
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of kind of the Dr. Elaine
ideology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where, look, you don't need to worry about
what the plant is taking out of the system
[SPEAKER_01]: because it'll be, just be replenished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like she had lots of, in that course I
took, there was lots of graphs and
[SPEAKER_01]: information and data where they took
organic matter and extracted it and
[SPEAKER_01]: calculated how much nitrogen was available
and just kind of basic organic matter that
[SPEAKER_01]: you would find in soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it far exceeded the amount of nitrogen
that was available in to be mined,
[SPEAKER_01]: not plant ready or available.
[SPEAKER_01]: But available to be mined by biology was
like four times the needs of some of your
[SPEAKER_01]: most nitrogen-hungry crops like corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like quite literally, there is so much
nutrient and mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, if you're in a sandy
desert, you know, that, that, and you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're dealing with a very heavy sand
soil, that's going to have a, that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to play a factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where John Kemp comes
in and is like, Hey, look, not every
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural soil this is going to work
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, given enough time and
enough organic matter, you could convert
[SPEAKER_01]: that sandy soil into really good tillith
and find yourself in a situation where you
[SPEAKER_01]: have actually superb, superb organic
matter content and, and thusly nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: cycling capability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a tough pill for a lot of folks
to swallow.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you tell somebody that they could get
all the nutrients they need out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter in your dirted biology,
they just don't, they don't buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I challenge folks to try to step out of
this absolutist approach and just look
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe try it, maybe try growing without
amending your soil every six months or
[SPEAKER_01]: just see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think that you've gotten to the
point where you're low, run a cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: run a cycle, see where your yields and
where your numbers are at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and my guess is that you're going to
find that there's going to be a negligible
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So negligible that any number of variable
could have contributed to whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: difference you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I, I hold hard and stand hard and
fast to that, to that fact that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: literally get whatever you need in
perpetuity.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're cultivating in that
system, as long as you've got adequate
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter and biology, your plants
will be able to mine exactly what they
[SPEAKER_01]: need, precisely what they need.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned Dr. Elaine Ingham's course,
and I've been wanting to take that for
[SPEAKER_00]: several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's just so hard to find the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a daughter now and my time is
occupied by her and, but eventually it's
[SPEAKER_00]: on my list of, of courses to tackle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many good courses out there and
so many great teachers out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she's definitely that course in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she has a couple of different
courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely want to go through at least
one of them here in the upcoming years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly recommended foundation course
material was a real eye opener for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into brewing teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is an area, like I mentioned,
but the people are so split upon,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got different teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, you know, you've got everything
from nutrient teas, manure teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got teas that focus on increasing
the microbiology, but you have folks that
[SPEAKER_00]: brew the teas and say it's great,
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very beneficial, but you've got
other, there's one scientist particularly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember her name, but she had
mentioned they're completely pointless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody should be brewing teas,
adding compost and then watering in that
[SPEAKER_00]: compost is just as beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on brewing teas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it is definitely a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think folks are not going to be
surprised that my, my concept of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of tea application, I think, I think first
off, I think there, there needs to be an
[SPEAKER_01]: important distinction that needs to be
made between what's commonly referred to
[SPEAKER_01]: as a tea and what should be classified as
an extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so an extract is just basically simply
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the name states it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're basically just extracting biology
from a medium, whether it's vermicompost
[SPEAKER_01]: or thermophilic compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're putting some of your high
quality biocomplete compost that has all
[SPEAKER_01]: the protozoa and protozoa and the
necessary fungi and bacteria in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an all attached, basically glued
and stuck to the organic matter in your
[SPEAKER_01]: compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put that into like a 220 bag or paint
bag or whatever your, your, your bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: bag, reused old bubble bag, 220 thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would use that to dunk the,
just dunk, gently dunk the compost in and
[SPEAKER_01]: out of kind of room temperature water and
slowly agitating and knocking off the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the biology from the organic matter and
then suspending it into the liquid matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you've got, you've got this liquid
that's just full of floating biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a really great way to introduce
concentrated biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you could use three or four cups,
dunk it into a five gallon bucket for a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute or 90 seconds or two minutes,
and then get another one, a fresh load.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like putting two teabags of Earl Grey
in your morning tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get a stiff cup of tea or
a stiff extract, we should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, by doing that, you could
really kind of control the, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the concentration of biology in whatever
you're, whatever you're suspending and the
[SPEAKER_01]: water you're suspending it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what the benefit of that is,
is that when you water that in,
[SPEAKER_01]: it, it really travels with the water,
penetrates deep into the root zone where
[SPEAKER_01]: you really want that biology to reside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very few variables considering your
compost was properly made.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've properly analyzed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you don't have bad guys in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not anaerobic or any of those other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not basically just adding
concentrated anaerobes to your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Assuming that all of those factors have
been met and you've got a really great
[SPEAKER_01]: stellar product, you're just going to be
adding those concentrated microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: directly to the root zone where they
belong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the safest way with the fewest
variables to introduce biology into your
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a tea, what people call tea,
some people would call the extract a tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should get away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should, we should call an
extract an extract and we should call
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that we actively brew,
anything that we're brewing for four
[SPEAKER_01]: hours, 12 hours, 36 hours, 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, I think where some people
have issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll say that there is a time and
place for a brewed compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, and this is what I
learned taking Dr. Elaine's course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to sound like a one trick
pony or just tooting one horn the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: time, but she really like lays things out
in a great way.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you brew a tea, usually you're adding
a food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's highly oxygenated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's happening is when you add a
food source and lots of oxygen,
[SPEAKER_01]: that biology is going to multiply and it's
going to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think biology, bacterial colonies,
they double every 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an exponential growth rate that
takes place when you're, when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: brewing a tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it's this process that if you do
it right, you can leverage it in your
[SPEAKER_01]: favor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't do it right, you can be doing
nothing at all, or you could actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: causing harm to your system, compounding
harm to your system over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll, and I'll, I'll, I'll explain a
little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an extract great for the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, the, the biology is just
suspended in the water flows down with the
[SPEAKER_01]: water, colonizes the root zone,
gets back onto organic matter in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: starts doing its business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you brew a tea that doubling
that multiplication process, the biology
[SPEAKER_01]: just getting busy in there, doing their
thing, creates a very sticky glomulin kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of gluey type substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can use that to your benefit by
only applying that as a foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause now what happens is you've got all
of that biology encased in a slimy sticky
[SPEAKER_01]: glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you spray it onto the surface of
a plant or onto the, onto the trunk of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, that water is carrying that sticky
substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slaps onto the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the water falls off and leaves
the biology behind on the surface of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now you've got active biology ready
to populate the entire surface of your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and literally create a castle wall,
a microscopic wall of biology that covers
[SPEAKER_01]: all of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when outside spores land on the plant
and try to hook in and do its thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, there's nowhere for it to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally landing on something else,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's landing on that biological film
that's taking place.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you inversely, if you take that sticky
gluey tea substance and you try to water
[SPEAKER_01]: it into the soil, it's all going to get
stuck at the top layer of your soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to penetrate down deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking an actively brewed tea and
applying it to your root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's been quantified,
you know, like how much is not making it
[SPEAKER_01]: down to the bottom, but the vast majority
of it's going to get trapped at that upper
[SPEAKER_01]: layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that upper layer is the most volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: That upper layer is the layer that dries
out first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it dries out, the biology dies,
the amoeba go into testate form,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then eventually they die.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the moisture doesn't get backs up,
back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're really, you've taken all this
time to create a tea and what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to accomplish is being reduced by
80% or even if it's 30% reduction in
[SPEAKER_01]: what's being delivered to the system,
you kind of have to like weigh things out
[SPEAKER_01]: and I go, is this even worth it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can think of teas as a foliar
application and extracts as a root zone
[SPEAKER_01]: application, you're going to eliminate a
lot of variables that can lend itself to
[SPEAKER_01]: undesirable results or just kind of
results that are meh, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if you follow those two rules,
you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with the brewing aspect of it,
if you're brewing a tea without the aid of
[SPEAKER_01]: microscopy, you're really just rolling the
dice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is when you've got biology in
there and they're reproducing at this
[SPEAKER_01]: exponential rate, they will eventually and
in very short order, use up all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: available oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter how big of an air pump
you've got pumping into your 200 gallons
[SPEAKER_01]: of water or whatever, you'll eventually
reach a tipping point of biological
[SPEAKER_01]: population that they simply have used all
the oxygen available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't add enough oxygen when it
reaches a certain point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at that point, you have an anaerobic
brew and all of that good biology that you
[SPEAKER_01]: had bloomed or grew over 12 hours or 24
hours is now starting to die because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not enough oxygen and they're
being replaced by anaerobes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this window when this is happening
that you're not going to be able to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: with your olfactory senses that you've
gone anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now obviously, you let it go long enough,
it's going to smell like sewage,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be like, hey, I'm
anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's going to be a period where
it's going to smell earthy, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: smell okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be like, oh man,
I can drink this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not great because oxygen has been
depleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've created an environment where
anaerobes thrive and that's where all your
[SPEAKER_01]: harmful pathogenic things reside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand where people are like,
don't brew teas because once again,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're not visually seeing what's
happening in there, you are literally
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling the dice.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your source material was full of
anaerobes and that's what you're using and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just breeding more anaerobes,
you really could be causing yourself more
[SPEAKER_01]: problems in your system or just not doing
anything at all and just wasting time and
[SPEAKER_01]: money, which time is the most precious
thing that I have and I hate wasting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically stick to straight extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even really do teas for foliar
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just really never felt that
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if I had an orchard and there was all
kinds of fungal threats to my orchard and
[SPEAKER_01]: regular foliar applications made more
sense, then I'd be doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the kind of crops that I'm involved
with just don't have that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm more concerned with making sure
that my soil is healthy and the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: biology is active and then whatever
foliars I do are strictly for nutrient or
[SPEAKER_01]: exudate enrichment tactics or strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you say that it's impossible to
answer the question when somebody says how
[SPEAKER_00]: long brewing tea is too long?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because there's so many different
variables as to what your starting
[SPEAKER_01]: material was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the temperature where you're
brewing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you brewing it in a 45 degree pole
barn in February in the Northeast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you doing it in 110 degree weather
out in the sun beaten down on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be so many different
variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best, most responsible answer is
when you can just have it analyzed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of soil food web labs that
will analyze your material.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll analyze what you've got and let
you know whether you've got good guys or
[SPEAKER_01]: bad guys or it's safe to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, if you've got a cash crop,
even if it's just your hobby, hobby
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, you know, 80 bucks for a test
is not the end of the world as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned to to get that peace of mind and
know where you reside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the flip side of that, too,
like, you know, learning how to use the
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope and identify the constituents
of what you want to find in there would be
[SPEAKER_01]: well worth it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a brilliant person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to learn the things and able to
apply them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a way that was effective and and
created a nice level of understanding that
[SPEAKER_01]: provided comfort in what I was doing and
not just kind of doing things willy nilly,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is fine proofs in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at some level, I wanted to know why it
was working and how it was working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the microscope really just aided in
seeing what was happening at this level
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a feeling you were going to say that
there was too many variables in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: answer the question on the timeline there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do four hours for six hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get plenty of reproduction
in that amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the longer you go, the longer
chance you have of depleting your oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, the smaller vessel you're
brewing in, if you're brewing in a five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon bucket for 72 hours, you do not
have an aerobic mix at the end of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty confident in saying that,
that, you know, you're you're definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be tipping the scales into the
aerobic, you know, and so less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could do a four hour brew and that
makes you feel better and you're good to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it because there's every 20 minutes,
the microbial population, the bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: population doubles every 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 12 hours is a long time when you've got
this exponential growth and certainly 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, what a conversation we have reached
the hour mark here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, there's a lot more we could have
gotten into in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we might have to get you back on
another episode if you're willing to come
[SPEAKER_00]: back on in the future here at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be thrilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can get into things such as like
cover crops, companion planting,
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's managing pests and diseases in an
all natural way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different things that we
can get into that relate to living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to have you on for part two,
but let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell listeners how they can find
you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you can really just find me
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use a handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just Joshua C Steensland on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a YouTube channel with a lot of
like that older material.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few things that have changed in
the living soil community since then,
[SPEAKER_01]: but nothing that was that's major enough
to invalidate the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by all means, go back, watch some of
those earlier at some no till live stream
[SPEAKER_01]: talks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're about eight years old now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's there's some good information
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, you can reach me on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty much not doing much.
[SPEAKER_01]: These days, corporate wise, I've really
just kind of taken a taken the chance to
[SPEAKER_01]: relax and kind of work on this property
that we just acquired a year and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but I'm always open to answer
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody has any questions, just DM me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might take me a day or two,
but I typically get back to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely have a link to Joshua's
Instagram and maybe YouTube channel down
[SPEAKER_00]: in the YouTube description section below
so you can easily get to him and give him
