[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with, welcome to the
grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up buddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Long time no see.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been on the podcast before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: February 6th, 2021 is when that was
released and here we are in 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time we linked up, we talked about,
well, the topic was the best advice for
[SPEAKER_00]: beginner gardening indoors and 345,000
views that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, you had so much great info on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so happy to have you back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this time around, we're going to talk
about breeding, something you'd kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: dip your toes in over these several years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to get all into this,
your story, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I do want to say congratulations to
you for passing 200,000 subscribers on
[SPEAKER_00]: your channel, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back when we first did that interview back
in 2021, you had 20,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your channel has exploded over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, 200,000 subscribers,
not easy, well-deserved, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have put in so much work over the
years, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just so happy for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you introduce yourself for those that
didn't catch the first episode we did
[SPEAKER_00]: together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they haven't seen that episode,
they should go back into your older videos
[SPEAKER_01]: and go watch this great episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is GT.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run a website and a YouTube channel
called Welcome to the Grow Tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: where I still focus on brand new growers
and teaching them the vernacular showing
[SPEAKER_01]: them that they can grow this plant without
a ton of equipment, a ton of expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to show everybody that
they didn't have to pay high dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: prices and that they could do this,
even if they were having trouble getting
[SPEAKER_01]: started with it in the beginning,
or they've had a few bad grows in their
[SPEAKER_01]: belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to show them that I can
teach you how to use this equipment that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't have to go out and buy anything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could still show you with whatever you
had, I could get you on the right track to
[SPEAKER_01]: where you were getting good yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had a lot of successful years
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to meet and talk to so many awesome
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this community so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of communities, you can have very
toxic behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of positive feedback and
interactions with this community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like this community and all the
creators that are around it that also put
[SPEAKER_01]: content out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you spend many, many years just growing
the plant naturally and then harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: and obviously consuming your harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've gotten to the point where you
are breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What got you into breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be right if I said it was just
one thing, but the natural curiosity and
[SPEAKER_01]: just wanting to learn about this plant
that I've loved so much for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just figured it was the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a very big chaser of effects,
so I don't really care about the color or
[SPEAKER_01]: what the fate of it looks like or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very big since I'm a medical patient
with it on how the plant or the cultivar
[SPEAKER_01]: or strain, whatever the Hipplingo is these
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a constant chaser of the effect of
whatever I'm smoking on because I have
[SPEAKER_01]: ADHD and I have really bad anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually use this plant to control
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to be on three different
medications and now I take none.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally walk around with dugouts in my
pocket and then just apply kind of as
[SPEAKER_01]: needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of those things where I really
like what this plant does, but I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really like the taste of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how it affects my anxiety is it's
immeasurable on how much I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what if I took this plant over here and
then I crossed it with this plant over
[SPEAKER_01]: here where I really like the taste of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it all started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my wife says that my ADHD can work as
a superpower for me because I can hyper
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on things that I'm interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can pick up learning curves on
things pretty easily because of that hyper
[SPEAKER_01]: focus that I get from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anytime I turn my attention on to
something, I usually go pretty hard in the
[SPEAKER_01]: paint trying to figure out how to do it
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many years has it been now since
you've been actually doing the breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I still consider myself completely new
to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had some really cool stuff that
we've made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say we, but it's just literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just sounds more normal for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've made some pretty cool stuff and I
still consider myself new to this field
[SPEAKER_01]: with only seven years under my belt
breeding and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've had a really good time doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever I first started doing it,
I was putting the videos up and I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: think anybody would be interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just kind of documenting what I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are like, hey, how do we get
something else?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, for what?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they were like, no, we want
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, you know, whenever I originally
started, it was literally I was just doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people are like, well,
wait, no, we want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's pretty much just how it
started, how it got me into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you personally like for taste,
smell and effects?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I find myself changing as I've
gotten older, because whenever I was
[SPEAKER_01]: younger, it was literally just skunky,
diesel, and then anything that could kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of calm my mind down is the effect that I
was always chasing with it is I always
[SPEAKER_01]: tell people my brain feels like it's on a
train and it's going to go down 30
[SPEAKER_01]: different tracks at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whenever I smoke, dude, it's just like
and it just like centers it back down onto
[SPEAKER_01]: one track.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can like focus and, you know,
and run down that just one track at a
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my wife, she's very good on calling
me out on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll be like, you've switched subjects
three times in the last 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, go upstairs and smoke and then
come back down and try talking again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because whenever I haven't smoked,
dude, like I'll bounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get like three, you know,
three fourths the way through explaining
[SPEAKER_01]: my point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will remind me of something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll jump to a different subject
and jump to a different subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually do it in my videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to have to spend a ton of time
editing it out and like refocusing it back
[SPEAKER_01]: onto the subject at hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of where the little
mantra for the channel where I talk about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you'll hear me, I'll say,
calm down, focus, relax, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just me kind of trying to
recenter myself to stay on topic because
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise I get, I'll just jump all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a video that was supposed to be about
this is five minutes in there talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, all right, calm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody started saying,
I got tired of editing out the videos is
[SPEAKER_01]: all it ever was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just started leaving it in
there and everybody really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now if you look on all of our shirt
designs, you actually see the relax,
[SPEAKER_01]: calm down and focus always hidden in the
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a couple of your t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've seen you wear them all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do wear them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the episodes is a tie-dye one,
a couple tie-dye ones used to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a purple frost giant one,
which we'll, I'm sure we'll be talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about purple frost giant here pretty
shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the taste, smell and effects
that you personally like, are you looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that in your breeding as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like are those the characteristics or
traits you look for when selecting parent
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: For breeding projects, or are you kind of
going after what the market wants instead?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'd be, it'd be remiss to say I
wasn't paying attention to the market
[SPEAKER_01]: because like some of these breeding
projects, like if you take anything out,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, seven or eight
generations, you could spend a decade
[SPEAKER_01]: working on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not something that the market
wants, then you, you spend a decade
[SPEAKER_01]: working on something that's no longer
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, what if you had somebody
that was like, Oh yeah, I'm really into
[SPEAKER_01]: eight track players and I'm going to spend
a bunch of time you know, making a cool
[SPEAKER_01]: eight, nobody wants eight track players
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like right now I feel like the
main majority of the markets really focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on like fruity or dessert kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do take those factors in there,
but my main, my main goal whenever I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding is effect, it's effect driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love when they smell fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the taste, but it's, and those,
those factors do play into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, and since I'm a
metal, I come at it with a medical kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a hundred percent, how does this
affect me?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I like it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do the people that tried it like it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they like this at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if they don't like it,
you know, I've had ones where I made where
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they were great, but they just
did not get a great reception from like
[SPEAKER_01]: the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that's why you do tests or
runs where you're like, what would you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, it grew great, but I didn't
really like the flavor profile or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe it came out a little extra
mint thali or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's just, you have to base
your decisions on, you know, kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of your, your clientele,
what they like, you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was just making it for, for me,
then I wouldn't care what anybody else
[SPEAKER_01]: said.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's, you gotta be a balancing
act, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of, a little bit of both,
you gotta satisfy yourself and the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I mean, luckily the, the market isn't
too, too far away from what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the more like candy smelling
strains, you know, I'm not terribly fond
[SPEAKER_01]: of, but there's a big, there's a big push
for them in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I take that into consideration when
I'm thinking about crosses or which
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes I'm hunting down and stuff like
that, because what I exactly want might
[SPEAKER_01]: not always be exactly what the market
wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've had bags where I opened it up
and it literally smelled like you stuck
[SPEAKER_01]: your head in a bag full of candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, meh, you know,
but other people like, I would use that
[SPEAKER_01]: bag to show off to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, here, smell this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh my God, I freaking
love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like amateur.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just, it's just one of
those things where like, I can see the
[SPEAKER_01]: appeal to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not be my favorite thing,
but I understand where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, whenever I was younger,
it smelled like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it just smelled like,
you know, skunky, you know, easily kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's like, you can smell candies and
different, you know, scents and flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but it's not to say I don't
appreciate it cause I do because I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate every, you know, every single
thing about this plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally hear you with the candy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I'm not too crazy about that
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of like a skunky, even like,
I even favorite earthy more than the candy
[SPEAKER_00]: type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody has their own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody has their own likes
and preferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dude, that's what's so great about this
plant is like, you're like, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love this string.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next day it's like, eh,
that was okay to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really liked this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just so many different
varieties and variations of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that, well, I didn't really like this one,
but I really liked this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I was told me, I was like,
try a bunch of them until you find
[SPEAKER_01]: something you really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it when you find your soulmate
strain where you're just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my God, this, this is exactly what I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go on this thing where you're
like, this is all I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine it's kind of like a Rob with his
like headbanger or whichever, or
[SPEAKER_01]: whichever.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes really a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Headbanger.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like I found a really,
a one I really liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in your, your gen two genetics,
uh, it was super earthy and like super
[SPEAKER_01]: lemony.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, as soon as I found that one,
I was like, you're my mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, and then I pulled it and then
turned it to where I pull all my clones
[SPEAKER_01]: from of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, yep, this is the one I
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I definitely want to get deeper into
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of your recent crosses,
but I want to start with your first crush
[SPEAKER_00]: you ever made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a story about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, this was one of the ones
where I was not a huge fan of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, like the smell or the taste of it,
but the effect it had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember I'm a super effect driven
person since I was using it for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I was not a huge fan of the
taste, but the way it would work with my
[SPEAKER_01]: ADHD and how well it worked for me,
it's just one of those things where I
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was literally just white widow
cross with big buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would smoke it all the time just
because of the effect that it had,
[SPEAKER_01]: not regular white widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was pretty big fan of taste and smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some reason, this white widow cross with
big buds, it worked like it used to be
[SPEAKER_01]: what I would call my soulmate train where
I'm like, it works so exactly for what I
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, I can, I can smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can still go do a ton of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It like quiets my mind as I would say,
and then it calms me down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, it worked so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually the strain that I found
that got me to, I went from three
[SPEAKER_01]: medications down to one as soon as I,
you know, start smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was like a godsend that it was
given to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, now if I can just get it
to taste a little bit better, it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole point with, I mean, the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like the whole reason to start
into the journey was literally just for
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I crossed it with this Alaskan purple
that I really liked because I'm a huge fan
[SPEAKER_01]: of like, like a birthday cake or like cake
batter, like taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I crossed it with this Alaskan
purple strain that I had that smelled
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly like, I used to say it was like,
right, if you pulled like a confetti,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just made a cake, like a confetti
cake, vanilla confetti cake base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put like vanilla icing on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that smell that you get when you put
out like the icing on a hot cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that smell that you get was the exact
smell that I was getting off of this
[SPEAKER_01]: Alaskan purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, if I could get this into
here, and I was like, wait, I might be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started, you know, that was
kind of like where I took off with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I could just, I never went
into it with ever thinking about doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: for the masses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was literally just doing it for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think there would be ever be any,
any interest in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just, you know, showing people how
to grow on video and, and I was literally
[SPEAKER_01]: just doing it for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was one of those things where it was
never like even a thought in my head of
[SPEAKER_01]: ever bringing it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just something I was just doing for
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what was the name of that cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called it giant purple monster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of your more recent crosses is
a collaboration between you and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: which honored that you reached out to me
and you wanted to do this collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Magic Candy Mountain OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us all about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, whenever I was coming up
with the name for it, we'll just even back
[SPEAKER_01]: that up even further.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had, you had sent me some of
your stuff before, and I was a big fan of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that earthiness and like the
lemoniness that I got from the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phantom plant responds to training
fantastically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, every aspect about the chill
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh gee, I was a fan of already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, well, what if I take
this and I, I had a super great Fino of
[SPEAKER_01]: the purple frost giant that I ended up
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I keep mothers of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like my now soulmate strain that I
constantly am walking around with just
[SPEAKER_01]: because how well it works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even as a guy, this is hurts me to say
even as a guy that is super like a skunky
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel kind of guy to walk around with the
strain that smells like freaking grape
[SPEAKER_01]: soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like all the time I'm like,
you know, at the same time, cause then I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I've transitioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've transitioned over to the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like something has happened to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm walking around with a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it literally smells like great
mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't like that smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get, when you first opened like a can,
not a bottle, but an actual can of like
[SPEAKER_01]: grape soda, like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smell from that fizz that initially
comes out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells exactly like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay, I can never get rid
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually into generation three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working onto it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a, I was like, how cool would
this be to cross this with Mr. Grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I think it would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I designed a whole thing of
merge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you sent me those a while
ago last year and I actually planned it
[SPEAKER_01]: all 50 all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think I got 50 or six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I planned them all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just, you know, I was like,
you know, keep super dedicated labeling of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up the one I liked the best was
from a second generation, one of the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: you sent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was pretty freaking stoked with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I put some pictures up on my
Instagram because YouTube yells at me
[SPEAKER_01]: whenever I try to show any kind of plant
on my videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and it could be a drawing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a drawing, a drawing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't even a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a drawing of the plant I put on
there and I got age restricted on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a drawing of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't even the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was literally just a leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got age restricted from a hand
drawing of a leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, all right, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't even show a cartoon drawing of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just, it was just one of those
things where I, I had liked it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I like something, you know,
I want to explore down that road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, it was just,
it was one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like, I got the name from an old
internet video that I used to watch and I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought it would, it worked well with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I had that, once I had the name
kind of figured out for it, and then I did
[SPEAKER_01]: the artwork for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I like to do artwork for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, it, it seemed like a
no-brainer to, to mix the two with how
[SPEAKER_01]: much I liked both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can save the artwork right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love your artwork, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of it's kind of similar style and it's
really cool that you do that for each
[SPEAKER_00]: release and you do shirts too,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I got one on, I got one on
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've sent you a few, I think I've sent Rob
a few, pigeons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've messaged him a few times about
getting an address from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never got an address from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't, I've never been able to send
pigeons anything up there in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but yeah, I do artwork for every
single drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spend a lot of time on the artwork and I
do I individualize for the drop and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: never, I never do them again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're kind of like timestamps as to
where you were kind of like hanging out
[SPEAKER_01]: with the channel, because if you have a
shirt, I only make them once and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: never make them again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you either got them whenever they
dropped or you don't ever have the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to get one again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't ever even tell the public
whenever they're going live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might for like a black Friday thing once
a year, but in general, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: literally be on the Patreon to even see
when the merch store is going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then whenever it does, I usually only
keep it up for either a weekend or four or
[SPEAKER_01]: five days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I close it back down immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get it while it's still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The magic candy mountain OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to growing myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't grown it out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got my hands on it and got one that
just sprouted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm eager to see how this one turns out
and I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So appreciate you doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got pictures of it on, on my
Instagram and I just went by and just
[SPEAKER_01]: clipped off a few buds and I have my hand
laying out like in the picture and I just
[SPEAKER_01]: grabbed a couple of buds and you can't see
my hand under the, just the three buds
[SPEAKER_01]: that I clipped off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could maybe see a, like a
fingertip over on one side, but what the
[SPEAKER_01]: coolest part about it was like everything
turned purple on the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all the trichomes were purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sugar leaves were purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the bud was purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this really is magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must be growing some pretty big plants
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big of plants do you grow for breeding
projects and container?
[SPEAKER_00]: What size container are you putting them
in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't really like growing in
anything over a five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not a fan of the, of the bigger
pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't have a problem with them per
se.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just three to five gallons,
depending on my plant count per tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if I have a higher plant count,
I probably won't go over a three gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have, uh, like if I have like four
plants in a five by five, I'll go up to a
[SPEAKER_01]: five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not anything crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the amount of, uh, dry days I get
out of the slightly smaller pots than the,
[SPEAKER_01]: than the, than the slightly bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, just personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I wouldn't have a problem if
somebody's like, yeah, I grow in seven or
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 getting, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, I don't think it has too big
of effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that, you know,
I like, I just, that's the style of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer is just the slightly smaller,
slightly smaller pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nutrients you use is going to have
impact on it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you using for nutrients and how
do you doing feedings throughout the life
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant now when you're breeding,
some people do it a little bit differently
[SPEAKER_00]: than when you're growing the plant just
regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I still rock general hydroponics,
uh, three part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like, because I'm like,
oh my goodness, these nutrients are so
[SPEAKER_01]: much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever people are getting into,
uh, growing, uh, I generally, if they go
[SPEAKER_01]: to the other local stores or whatever,
the likelihood of them finding the general
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics three part is probably along
the top of the list of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be easy for them to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really, it was never that I
liked that brand better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was literally just about if a new
person does this, what would be the
[SPEAKER_01]: easiest nutrient line for them to five?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause yummy or to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you could go get some, you know,
Oh, I really like this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, nectar of the gods or whatever,
but it might be way more harder to find
[SPEAKER_01]: for somebody at their growth store than
something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not carry that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might only carry flora flex or they
might, you know, whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could go through, there's thousands of
nutrient manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was literally just about what's the,
what would be the easiest for a new person
[SPEAKER_01]: to find?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be the most recognizable?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I still grow with it to this day,
just for that reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but yeah, like you're saying,
I 100% treat them different, whether we're
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding plants or if I'm just growing
them out regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that kind of stays the same
is, in the veg cycle, cause I generally
[SPEAKER_01]: don't feed while they're in veg because I
buy pre-amended soil and the pre-amended
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if people know this,
but it already has the food in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it costs so much because the
nutrients that you would need to give
[SPEAKER_01]: them, they're already in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant can literally break down what's
in the soil and eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, if you took something
inert and put like dry soil, there's dry
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The food's already in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since I'm transplanting, going from
like cubes, the solo cups, the one
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons, the three, and then maybe the
fives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever I go to flower, every time you
transplant, you can't think of it as
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just putting a new dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're literally, you're feeding the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all new dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got new nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're technically feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just am not going in there and manually,
you know, making a nutrient mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the whole time the plants in flower,
I just treat it like it's, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the end of veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I give them equal parts of nitrogen,
potassium, and magnesium or phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just give them equal amounts,
whether it's, uh, four, four and four or
[SPEAKER_01]: five, five and five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just give them equal parts throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only other big difference is I
never switch over to mag sulfur from cow
[SPEAKER_01]: mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give them cow mag the whole,
the, uh, the whole way through the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: for the extra calcium and they always need
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just don't need the bulking agent
with the sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know breeders who actually will stick
with the veg nutrients throughout all of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's exactly what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it like it's transition week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just literally like it's the last
week of edge is the, the method that I go
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's literally just four of nitrogen
or let's just say five and nine,
[SPEAKER_01]: five milliliters per gallon of nitrogen,
five of phosphorus and five of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just stick with, I stick with
that one because it's a nice balance of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm not going for giant flower bulks
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's a nice, you know, like a well
balanced diet for them hitting that food
[SPEAKER_01]: triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just carry that all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then normally if I was doing a normal
flower cycle, it would be at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: week three, I would switch off of cow mag
and I would switch onto mag sulfur product
[SPEAKER_01]: because the stretch is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I no longer need the calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's mag in both products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need mag all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then since the stretch is over and now
I'm going into the bulking phase after a
[SPEAKER_01]: transition week of flower and week four,
I'm now going into the bulking phase of,
[SPEAKER_01]: phase of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care about the bulking phase of
the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not where my attention is,
nor is it where the attention of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: is because it's received pollen by that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants, you know, that's one of the
tricks to making, you know, bigger buds is
[SPEAKER_01]: we are denying them pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by denying them pollen, it causes them
to swell their buds because they're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to get bigger because pollen floats in the
air or to attract flying pollinators,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: By denying them pollen, it makes the bud
get bigger and bigger because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to increase surface area to catch
that pollen that's in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, whenever I give them pollen,
I've specifically got pollen painting it
[SPEAKER_01]: on like Bob Ross on each of the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing for bulking up the flowers
isn't there anymore because they've
[SPEAKER_01]: already accomplished their life goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their life goal is they were trying to
reproduce and now they've reproduced
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're making the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get into pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you actually reverse plants
and I want to get into that afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I want to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about pollinating females.
[SPEAKER_00]: That needs to happen in order for seeds to
be developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around what day do you typically pollinate
your female plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do it based off bud size and how
the plant's progressing, because you have
[SPEAKER_01]: some strains that you might have a,
you know, a 10 week strain versus an eight
[SPEAKER_01]: week strain or a 12 week strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of hard focusing on a day,
I actually do it by plant development and
[SPEAKER_01]: size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, if you have a eight to nine
week flowering strain, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: around the end of week three, somewhere in
the beginning to middle of week three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Week four is kind of like the sweet spot
I've found with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a strain that takes longer
to flower and I go in and I pollinate week
[SPEAKER_01]: three, my bud structure, I might still
have those little tiny golf balls with
[SPEAKER_01]: just the, you know, the starting
sprinklings of pistol hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's way too early to do this because if
you pollinate too early, the bud size
[SPEAKER_01]: never gets as big as it could have gotten
if you waited just like another week or
[SPEAKER_01]: so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then plus you don't just don't have a
ton of pistol hairs to paint yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like those pistol hairs are
your, those are your receptor cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are your sites for the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's not a ton of them yet,
it's just, it's too early to bring pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: into the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really just around, generally
it's just shoot for week four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally your buds are big enough,
but if they're not, just wait a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like it's, there's a timer on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you pollinate a plant,
you ask anybody that's ever heard them to
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, you pollinate those plants at week
five, week six of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and if you look out into like,
the, you know, you know, the nature that
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen's flying around the air all,
you know, all year and they have way
[SPEAKER_01]: longer flower times whenever you're out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we all remember the, we used to
get back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd you do when you first got it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to sit down on your, your TV tray
or your little, your rolling tray that you
[SPEAKER_01]: had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we had to do, we had to pick out
all the seeds and all the stems on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was somebody's job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to sit there and you had to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by the end you had the shaky
stuff that you had left.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a pile of seeds and a pile of
stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what your job was to sit there
and break it all apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you can put that in your bowls or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have this luxury of having seed
free back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad those days are behind us and we
don't have to worry about seeds within the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought myself right back around to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause pretty much every month I'm
harvesting seeded stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So luckily now I have machines that do it
for me though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you bring up a great point about when
to pollinate the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a couple different ways you
can do the pollination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, the way you're doing it,
which you mentioned is you're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: painting the pollen onto the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other folks, what they'll do is they'll
take, actually take the plant that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed or the male plant and they'll
stick it in the same room and just let
[SPEAKER_00]: them, let the wind naturally bring it
through air circulation or they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: actually shake the plant within gross
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you choose to use the paint brush
and paint the buds versus just shaking the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in the gross space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Clean up mess that it makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever, cause I've done, I've done a
couple different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's actually videos where you see
me and I take the plant and I set it on
[SPEAKER_01]: like a upside down five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get a leaf blower and I stand
at the back of the tent and I pretend like
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like doc and I'm like, all right,
we got 88 gigawatts or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm blasting or 1.21 gigawatts and I'm
blasting the, the, the fan, the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: blower fan right through the back of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only, the only, the only reason
that I don't do this is just because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the mess it makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the entire room, I don't think
people understand, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: working with males, the amount of pollen
that they make, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you don't have to always,
you don't have to reverse a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just do a couple of branches just
because those couple of branches makes so
[SPEAKER_01]: much pollen that it's, you know,
it's crazy how much that you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get off of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whenever I make a mess with it,
I mean, it's just, I detailed clean very
[SPEAKER_01]: well in between grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of gunk that I have to get
off the walls and off the fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I like, I take the fans down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take the fans apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I clean them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take the lights to, you know,
I just detailed clean everything in
[SPEAKER_01]: between grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of extra work it provides
whenever I don't just paint, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes me 30 seconds to just sit there
with, I have this Barbie brush,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's hot pink, like this thing
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this Barbie brush that I stole from
my daughter's makeup, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can absorb so much pollen with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do the whole tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do the whole tent with just one,
you know, just pick up a bunch of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can paint the whole tent with just one
brush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the amount of work it saves me is
the main reason that I do it with a brick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they all work.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those methods that you mentioned,
whether you just put one in, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do that, you put it in front of
your fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it blows it out towards the rest of the
tent or whether you shake the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: all those methods, they all work just
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason I do it is just really
simply because of cleanup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good reason to do it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I got a ton of other stuff in the
room and the amount of pollen that gets
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it looks like, it looks like I've
been doing drywall work in there only it's
[SPEAKER_01]: got a slightly yellow tinted drywall and
I've got the amount of area that I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: clean up is just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to say it was for some really
cool reason, but it really just saves me
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some grow tents that,
you know, yellow sides, like it's tough
[SPEAKER_00]: with the ventilation socks are,
and they like, you know, come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting every single nook and cranny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hear you on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you collecting pollen from the
reversed plant and putting into a
[SPEAKER_00]: container and then doing the paintbrush
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also do you store pollen at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do it live in real time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't ever store any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had, you know, there's a reason
there's no company that just sells pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't, it, once it leaves the
plant, it's life cycle is, is not
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they don't handle like, can you
imagine if you, if you were like just
[SPEAKER_01]: brought up a company, they would be a
hundred percent legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could ship it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just feminized pollen, the amount of money
you can make.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't survive very well,
the shipping process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always just live timed it to
where my males were ready around the time
[SPEAKER_01]: that I need my females ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even if the plant is dropping
pollen, you don't have to collect it right
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like let's say your female isn't ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just leave it on that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you'll be spilling stuff onto the
leaves and stuff, but you can literally
[SPEAKER_01]: just leave it on the plant and then wait
your extra half week or week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you shouldn't be that far off and
then collect the pollen and then put it on
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you can use the,
the male or the feminized female as kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like a little storage locker for it and
then live time collected and then
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just never had the best luck with like
trying to store it or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just always live time it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one other thing that is vastly
different from just growing the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally is the length of time you're
actually growing the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not looking for a specific
harvest window.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really looking at the trichomes
to see, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to harvest, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're letting it go longer than that in
order for those seeds to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you typically let a plant grow
until you harvest the seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's probably going to vary
depending if you have an eight week or
[SPEAKER_00]: nine week or so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, how much longer is
the plant growing until you harvest the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always tell everybody it's, it's around
seven to eight weeks from pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always tell everybody you're pretty
much restarting your flower the day you
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I always tell everybody is the
second we pollinate them, we no longer
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the trichomes for when our harvest
is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we actually use the seeds as our
black, kind of like our trichome markers,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they go through color stages,
just like the trichomes do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll start off green, then they'll turn
to white, then they'll turn to gray,
[SPEAKER_01]: then they go brown with tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can, they're never all going to be
able to be on the same page.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do it just like we do with our
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're basing off of what's the majority of
what we're looking at on the plant at this
[SPEAKER_01]: time is kind of how we dictate with when
the plant comes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm looking and I'm like,
ah, we got the majority green.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know we're way far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, we come back a few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority is white with a minority of
gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the pods are starting to split
open on the top, which we get a really
[SPEAKER_01]: good view of when we can start watching
them because the tops of the pods,
[SPEAKER_01]: they actually split open like this and you
get a really good view window right on the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of them on how they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as I see where the majority
are brown and tiger striped, and there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: minority of gray, that's whenever I chop
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just based on visually,
whenever I look over the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do they look like they're doing right
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, it's the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever you're looking at trichomes,
the plant functions the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lets you know when it's ready to chop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you are really just create
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct me if I'm wrong there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do occasional regs, but not many.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're focusing on feminized in order
to actually get feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to basically reverse a plant that
is already growing as a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: You reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden it starts
creating pollen sacks and then releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the way you reverse
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of different ways you can
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Clodio silver, there's STS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people combine the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your process for reversing the
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've done all three of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done just Clodio silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done just STS spray, and then I've
done the combo of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've done all of them, you know,
multiple and multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always found that the combo of
both has got me the best results as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen production is what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like with the Clodio, I have the
least effective way with Clodio silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of plants that will,
they'll make the same sacks and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: sacks will be empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: There won't be any pollen in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's literally only, the main problem
with that one is just with the Clodio
[SPEAKER_01]: silver and run into that occasionally with
STS spray, not as often, but I've always
[SPEAKER_01]: found that whenever I do the combo of both
of them together, I usually have really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really good results as far as pollen
production of the plants and the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: sites that I get to collect it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a Clodio silver creeping up for a
month, you're supposed to be spraying once
[SPEAKER_00]: a day, some people do it multiple times a
day, this by the plant for the first,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks or three weeks or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three weeks is what, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if in the parts per million,
they come in different parts per million,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make your own Clodio silver too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a terribly hard process,
but the minimum I found that works is 30
[SPEAKER_01]: parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found kind of like the sweet spot
right around the 50-ish parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if like all I had was Clodio
silver, it's three times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the last week of veg through the
first two weeks of flower, and then I cut
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that gives us enough time because
the plant should be dropping its pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: around week three to three and a half of
flower, which puts you right on where you
[SPEAKER_01]: normally would be attacking your females
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're using STS, STS is a
little bit more, I'll say hands off,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's work to where you're only
spraying once every five days,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I've tried before and unfortunately
quite recently actually, it didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant didn't actually reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_00]: I planted all around this and it didn't
actually work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the STS spray, I found that once
every five days is a little bit long for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the timeframe is slightly off
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to account for that whenever
you're doing your females.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever I'm going to make the male
version of the female plant and I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to use just STS spray, I actually start
them into their flower a week or two
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier than the other plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants go into flower because whenever
you're doing just STS spray, it's once
[SPEAKER_01]: every five days for the first 30 days of
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can still be spraying four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you stop there before the four
weeks are up, you can actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll end up with no pollen at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't even get the reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very important, but I've dropped
it down to every three to four days that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just do it once a day,
right before the lights go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big thing is the light actually
damages the STS.
[SPEAKER_01]: The STS spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then whenever you're combining it,
if you don't combine it in the right
[SPEAKER_01]: order, which there's only two parts,
but if you put it in wrong and you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: get that cool fizzy reaction that happens
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't get it that right,
or if you add it too fast, it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: will make it inert and you have to watch
for the fizz.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to keep it just to where it
keeps fizzing on itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to go back and try doing both
the combo, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to try to get a better result.
[SPEAKER_01]: The combo is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever it's a combo, I kind of switch
it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the last two weeks of veg,
I'll do just STS spray for once every
[SPEAKER_01]: three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then whenever we switch into flower,
I switch over to colloidal silver and I
[SPEAKER_01]: spray it three times every day for the
first two weeks, which is literally the
[SPEAKER_01]: worst part of the grow that I have to go
into there three times a day, every single
[SPEAKER_01]: day, Monday through Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do what you got to do in order
to get that reversal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my least favorite part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, ah, and it's not like it's
crazy hard, but it's just my finger gets
[SPEAKER_01]: tired because I have like the pump spray
bottle like this, because you don't need a
[SPEAKER_01]: ton of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go through it way too fast
when you have like the big spray bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just have this little spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's my hand just gets tired of
spraying all the different branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had mentioned that you only
reverse a branch or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not reversing the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how much I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the biggest thing, especially because
you can run into problems where you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: get any pollen from the pollen or they
don't reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if let's say I'm trying to pollinate
six plants, I'll grow nine and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: three different plants that I'll pull into
a different tent to reverse just because I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to weigh out my, I don't ever just
put all my chips on one because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: store pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will grow extra plants just to have
backups in case, you know, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: that one, what if something happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if a fan falls on it and breaks it
and kills it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I have nothing because now I have
no males that are or females that are
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere close to being ready to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always just have backups on
backups whenever I'm getting ready to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, go through that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I want to make sure that if I want
to make a line like, oh, no, this didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I didn't get as much pollen as I
wanted, which is never usually the case,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it does occasionally happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always have backups on backups just
in case, but it makes me go through a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of colloidal silver and STS spray though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it safe sided, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because no, maybe if I had a giant store
room and the pollen stayed really well,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'd be one thing, but I just don't like
the staying power of the pollen once it
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just make sure I have plenty of
females on deck that are giving me pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about the reversal process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about really growing the plants,
you know, the nutrition you use,
[SPEAKER_00]: container size, how long you're letting
the plants grow, when you're pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's your process for getting seeds
tested, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, an ethical thing to do would be
before releasing to the public would be to
[SPEAKER_00]: get them tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your process for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I actually have a beta tester
program built into my Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of it is, you know,
I never sell anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all my stuff, all the stuff I make,
I give away completely free to the people
[SPEAKER_01]: on my Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't ever charge for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a huge sampling audience that
does a lot of testing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Hey, we like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we don't like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the germination rates that we
got.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are, you know, like of the ones that
came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're having with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know before it even ever goes out to
the mass of the Patreon, because I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: beta tester program that helps me with the
testing of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we go through a pretty extensive back
and forth with everything we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes out to the Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get this huge, you know, envelopment of
information from growers of all styles,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they're doing hydro or whether
they're doing any kind of media based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whether they're new or very expert
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get this, just this huge information
dumps every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time I release a line,
I just feel like it makes me a better and
[SPEAKER_01]: better grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm trying to do, we kind of
refine the process every single time we do
[SPEAKER_01]: a drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I've got to the point now
where I'm doing usually five to six new
[SPEAKER_01]: drops per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it works out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Patreons are awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're just, they're such,
they're such great people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I really am thankful for this
community and what it's done for my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really love interacting with the
people of this, of this community every
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you have a great support
system over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of folks, breeders in
particular, who look for testers or have
[SPEAKER_00]: testers, some of them just ghost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I first sent out the Chill at
OG, that cross that I made for testers,
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of the people just didn't even
respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got nothing from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was looking for the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you got some pretty
stable stuff over there on the Patreons
[SPEAKER_00]: side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've built a pretty amazing discord that
I actually had to turn the notifications
[SPEAKER_01]: off because it's, you know, thousands and
thousands of people in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the best growers I've ever seen
and the feedback and the picture up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it gets live time, real
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every new line has its very own dedicated,
you know, browser section to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you can just sit there and
look at the progress and see what kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: if people are having problems or the luck
or the different terpene profiles that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're having through there, it's been
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, this one's super mentally or
this one's this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really great to get that kind of
feedback on something that you're making
[SPEAKER_01]: to have thousands of people all doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually whenever I release it,
they all are planning at the same time to
[SPEAKER_01]: have that kind of feedback and information
instantly back on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what advice do you have for those that
are just getting into breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't trace hype would probably be my
number one and figure out what you like
[SPEAKER_01]: first and think of the reasons you're
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the main one would be think of
the reasons you're doing it and don't
[SPEAKER_01]: chase the hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll find if you go after what
you like, the process won't become arduous
[SPEAKER_01]: or like work because you're going to
actually enjoy doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because crossing things, you know,
it's, it's not a ton of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on what you're doing,
but it's definitely more work,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you're reversing and
feminizing and then getting all the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have the cool machines that
do it for you, it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick all them freaking seeds out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's some really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one more question I wanted to ask
you that wasn't actually on the list,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is talking about hype, chasing the
hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of hype around triploids
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on triploids?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of people that agreed with me
and then I got a lot of heat from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my view on it is just maybe jaded
because, you know, I grew up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Midwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was watched a lot of my friends,
families really get messed over with non
[SPEAKER_01]: reproducing seeds and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the new growers, I think they're
fantastic or I don't, I just, I'm not,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm not a fan personally,
but for new growers for something that
[SPEAKER_01]: won't seed or her once again, I think it's
a crutch, but I understand why you would
[SPEAKER_01]: like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the same thing as like when
autos first came out, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's like, oh, you don't have to switch
them over to, they do switch over to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower all by themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that hard to switch a timer,
but you know, I'm a photo period guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just, it's not one of my favorite
things, but I do understand why people
[SPEAKER_01]: would like them, especially where they,
you know, they won't make seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter how bad you treat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather just become a slightly
better grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't worry about herming my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to get me in trouble anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, I got a lot of hate from that
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of great views on it,
but I did get a lot of hate from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The video I'm looking at your page right
now, the dangers of triploids and the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems coming 31,000 views.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clicked on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to you and you brought up some
good points in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned that they're not
supposed to herm, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, unfortunately we're not,
they're not seeing that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a, we've got that the donuts,
triploid from Humboldt, people reporting
[SPEAKER_00]: herms, you know, people are putting herms
happening there, which I never like to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear that they're not supposed to,
but we're out seeing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that makes me sad, you know,
cause like I understood like how cool that
[SPEAKER_01]: could be, especially for new growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't have to worry about this
harming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understood the point of it and I
understood the appeal of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, as a new grower, I would want
people to treat, you know, I would want
[SPEAKER_01]: you to treat the cold, not just the cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why are you coughing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is this plant doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, we're just gonna make a plant that
doesn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll get better results in the long
run.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you figure out why this is happening,
what stressor are you doing to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's causing it to herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's what that was supposed to be
a plant that just genetically wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed, wouldn't have been allowed to
make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Life finds a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us how can listeners find you and
what do you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: How they can find me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can either just go to my,
uh, my YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called welcome to the grow tent,
especially if you're looking for any kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of new information on, uh, on how to grow
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can definitely show you how to do it
with, uh, any equipment that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be able to show you how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or you could join the patron and we
can do one on someone's sessions,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like me and Mr. Groot are doing right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will actually sit here in my box and on
the other box will be your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I work with your gardens, just like
I'm sitting there in your grow room with
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I do that all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, then I get on there and I answer
questions every single day on my Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we have one of the biggest panic
content creation, uh, patrons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there is, we have close to 700 and
something members.
[SPEAKER_01]: It varies up and down of course,
but, uh, uh, it's, uh, it's a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as I said earlier, all the
crosses that I ever make those,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, patrons get my stuff absolutely free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never charge a penny for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get access to all my cool
merch that I make.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a link to it in all my video
descriptions in on my YouTube page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have a good time and, uh,
it's a freaking blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then far as, uh, upcoming,
uh, I have a bunch of new crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it GT's year of fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's coming up this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, uh, the never next drop is
blueberry muffins crossed with blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have early lemon berry that is
getting crossed with super great PFG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, then we have run.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting crossed with strawberry
mimosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the kind of like the biggest
thing for the end of the year is I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: collab coming up with dark horse and we
are crossing their, uh, Bruce Banner S
[SPEAKER_01]: three with my PFG or, uh, maybe some of
the coolest artwork ever made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to figure out how to not get
sued by Marvel for the idea I have in my
[SPEAKER_01]: head for it.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be tuned into that and hopefully I
can get my hands on some of those crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: because they sound amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're, uh, I'm looking forward to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I said, I'm super excited about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super excited about, uh, the collab
that we just got done with, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the people are planning them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're having, you know, it's like 9,500%
success rates through germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're talking about how fast they're
growing and stuff like that.
