[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for those of you that
don't know me, my name is Chris,
[SPEAKER_00]: aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned into the
Garden Talk podcast, this episode number
[SPEAKER_00]: 157.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Cartier
Crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been on the podcast once before,
episode number 74, where he talks all
[SPEAKER_00]: about plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue the conversation about plant
breeding in this episode, but we narrow
[SPEAKER_00]: down the focus to creating feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also tells us several stories about
crosses that he has created, three of them
[SPEAKER_00]: being released this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see short clips of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk clips
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a gardening channel where I
show the plants that I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those channels will be linked down
in the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my goals for this podcast is to
bring free information about gardening to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.

Cartier Crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I'm feeling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loving life, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, welcome back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your second time on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time was actually episode number 74,
back July 16th, 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years ago, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time flies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was sick at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had chest issues, and had some
breathing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so this one's gonna be a lot,
a bit more active, a bit more engaging
[SPEAKER_02]: than the last.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was damn near in my death bed the last
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I remember that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened back a couple days ago,
and I remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh man, yeah, he wasn't
feeling good, and he still did it,
[SPEAKER_00]: still battled through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't feeling good either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just, we got it done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just what we do, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the loving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would hate to go out in life,
and not be able to do interviews,
[SPEAKER_02]: and do the things that you love to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I was a croak over at that second,
I'd been happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, I went out like a soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if we weren't feeling 100% still,
the episode did very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got 46,000 views.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about a whole bunch of
different things in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your story, some of your breathing
techniques we got into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I want to get a little bit deeper
into things that you do within breathing,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically creating feminized seeds,
which is something you do, and you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of experience with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's gonna bring a lot of
value to the audience, because a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people like fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're trying to be, you being super
nosy, but it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll share as much as I can, you know,
but it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know there's a couple of different
ways you can do it, which we'll get into
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, before we get too deep into it,
can you introduce yourself for those that
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't catch the first episode we did
together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Cartier Crops, and I've been growing
since 1996 in the soil, started outdoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: went horribly wrong, came to indoor,
found that it's a lot better because you
[SPEAKER_02]: can have control, but I've been growing,
you know, behind the scenes for many,
[SPEAKER_02]: many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, come 20, about 2018 is when
I went online, but prior in 2012,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a delivery service.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really got into breeding really heavy
and, you know, started native sun genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: and was, I did not start the company to
help people at the time, other than my
[SPEAKER_02]: flower, cause I was in the streets,
you know, it was other than the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really geared to making genetics
that would work for me and, and separate
[SPEAKER_02]: myself from the crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't until 2018 when I found out
that after I started helping people
[SPEAKER_02]: online, I saw, you know, I saw an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people had issues with genetics,
either they were very expensive,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I can agree because, you know,
it takes a long time and a lot of effort
[SPEAKER_02]: to create genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: But two is that people were getting
scammed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of issues going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the people I was helping in my network,
which is up to 24,000 people in my private
[SPEAKER_02]: group on Facebook was, you know,
they just want a good genetics and they
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to talk to the breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was another thing that they
didn't have access to breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you buy seeds and then you'll
never get to talk to a breeder rarely
[SPEAKER_02]: happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was able to offer that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I started freeholder
Friday in my group, which we do to this
[SPEAKER_02]: day, where I hook up people for it with
seeds on Fridays and kind of do the,
[SPEAKER_02]: go along to help them out, help people
out, play little games and things of that
[SPEAKER_02]: nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it wasn't until 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when COVID hit in 2020, that things
really took off because again,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is what I love to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to create and, and, and,
you know, breed and whatnot, but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: until that time that I saw people needed
help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I just decided to offer
some of my genetics to help out at no
[SPEAKER_02]: cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't like I came into the game and
just put price tags on everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my network could tell you,
I did it out of love and got a passion and
[SPEAKER_02]: I just enjoyed doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was already financially okay in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing what I was doing in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just a fun time for me to take
this on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's kind of where it
started me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, again, helping people
I found, you know, when I started helping
[SPEAKER_02]: people online, I found the greatest joy in
watching someone struggle with something I
[SPEAKER_02]: love to do and overcome those struggles
and grow their own herb and generate
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's profits or whether it's more,
more in our network, pounds after pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have people who grow so much herb now
they don't, they give it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: At Christmas time, they give it away to
their friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a great joy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, they're passing on what
I've taught them to other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the genetics keep us tied in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The knowledge keeps flowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just been a great thing to
experience because when you're authentic
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know what you're talking about and
you enjoy this realm, hey, this is what I,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is what I like come here to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a bit about Cartier Native sub
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we're here for the people,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm a part of your email list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jesus, it seems like you're always
hooking up your audience and you got some
[SPEAKER_00]: really good prices on genetics as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, when this episode is being
posted, it's a day after Black Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any Black Friday sales going
on right now that the audience should know
[SPEAKER_00]: about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, everybody loves our Black Friday
sales because again, our genetics are
[SPEAKER_02]: already so low.
[SPEAKER_02]: People say how, why, how, why,
even some of my friends say you're crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're kind of gyping yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say, well, you know, not really,
because ultimately, again, I came in with
[SPEAKER_02]: the notion to help people out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you come in like that and you
know, you get a hundred thousand people
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting and talking and this and that,
you know, you could, you're taking care of
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not looking at the financial
side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking more at the brand and more
of the products that are moving and the
[SPEAKER_02]: creations that are moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when, with Black Friday coming up,
you know, we have something going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that Black Friday is here,
we have our creation that's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took your Chillout OG and I was able
to be blessed by you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I don't ever work with other breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I've been asked by many other
breeders, let's work on projects together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel the money is always the first
thing that they see.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see large networks and they want to
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Chillout OG, I saw something
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see how you are passionate about the
people you help and almost we're on the
[SPEAKER_02]: same wavelength in terms of the passion
and wanting to help folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, this year's drop is going to
be very special because it has to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: someone that's passionate like yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's someone like our team that's
passionate about our work and what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have three of my biggest hitters
that have done very well over the past
[SPEAKER_02]: seven years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Cartier Cookie, which is our
strain that started everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Boot Gotti, which was tested over the
past five years, dropped on Halloween five
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just took over our network and people
absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a Sour OG I'll tell you a bit more
about because it took forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took seven years to get this cut from
an OG who comes from LA that is based in
[SPEAKER_02]: Phoenix now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's a street legend right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was so hard to get my hands on as
you're talking about an OG Kush from 1990,
[SPEAKER_02]: think of the 80s, 89 and then a Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That he worked on from 92 until now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's been able to cross those to
create a Sour OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I just felt like,
yo, I'm going to bring some stuff to the
[SPEAKER_02]: table to match with what you got going on
and create some magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the drop that's happening now
for Black Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely want to get deeper into those
genetics later on in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really honored that you actually kind
of partnered up with me in order to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely want to also find out
what you saw in the Chillout OG that
[SPEAKER_00]: really sparked your interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get into that here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sale runs until Cyber Monday,
I assume.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go until Cyber Monday, but I kind of
like to leave it open because a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: times folks, wives or husbands still want
to buy those stocking stuffers up until
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I leave it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally what I do is leave everything
open until everyone takes everything and
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of just honor that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we close that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the end of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really try to damn near give away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like a giveaway just out of
saying, hey, I appreciate you guys for the
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's worth checking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth taking advantage of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can guarantee that the end result is
worth every bit of putting into your
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you can give me a YouTube
friendly link, I'll definitely toss that
[SPEAKER_00]: in the description section as a pinned
comment as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you a YouTube friendly link and
people can go there all day, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like to mess with us for some reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into breeding now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I remember about our last
conversation was you said you started out
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen chucking and you had felt,
well, it seemed like you felt like that
[SPEAKER_00]: was kind of a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, what is pollen chucking?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you kind of compare it to what you
do now, which is selective breeding?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, breeding is very easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But being a great breeder is very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I mean by that is pollen chucking
is no more than growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you grow 20 seeds and they
regular photos and you get a male and a
[SPEAKER_02]: female and the male pops up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first thing that comes to people's
mind is, oh, I have pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can pollinate these these ladies and I'm
going to have seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: But.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we consider pollen chucking,
because you never really got to find out
[SPEAKER_02]: about the genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't you don't know anything about
the males.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know about the history of the
line or there's just so many unknowns.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of you're kind of shooting an
arrow aiming at a target in the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I did that in the beginning,
many years ago, nothing was coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: correct at all, you know, and wasn't
coming out right at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that leads a breeder to what we call
phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so phenohunting is essential when it
comes to looking for the proper genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's it's it's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes skill to actually phenohunt
when it comes to the rub, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: the smell, when it comes to the end
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny, because sometimes I don't even
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to smoke the end product.
[SPEAKER_02]: People say, well, how are you able to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because ultimately, when your senses are
all there, when you smoke, you kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: mess your senses up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes doing it throughout a
breeding, I did it with the chill out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't smoke for two or three months so I
can get the full essence of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: the rubs, the smells and bring in all of
the essence of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My fingers don't have bud smell on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can really get a full vibe off of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what happens is, you know,
when you pollen chuck, you're just
[SPEAKER_02]: throwing pollen on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're taking seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you would literally have to pop one
hundred thousand seeds to find that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you understand selective
breeding, you would say, hey, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a bad female right here,
one that is superb and supreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I can take another supreme clone and
another supreme clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when it comes to the males,
now that's what you select and that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going after.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've bought a male before for a thousand
dollars, which we'll talk about later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've bought a male for a thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: People thought I was insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I understood that, you know,
breeding is, you know, is, is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you take Lisa Leslie and
Shaquille O'Neal, you're probably going to
[SPEAKER_02]: catch a seven footer in that gene line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven out of ten.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just like dog breeding,
you're not going to take a stud that is
[SPEAKER_02]: champion from all across the country and
then go around to Roro's house around a
[SPEAKER_02]: corner who breeds pit bulls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's got all kind of weird pit bulls
and just breed that dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get a so-so pit instead of
breeding with a woman across the country
[SPEAKER_02]: who has a as has a another champion that's
been labeled a champion in his own right
[SPEAKER_02]: or her own right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So blending those two together nine times
out of ten, you're going to get a very
[SPEAKER_02]: great offspring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you, when you pollen chuck,
you are not creating the best genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: that are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see it all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see people, there's so many,
since the last time we talked,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's probably a hundred thousand seed
banks that popped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many of those are pollen chucking
and how many of those are truly doing
[SPEAKER_02]: phenol hunts with large facilities and
super rare.
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly doubt it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's my take on pollen
chucking, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our last episode, we went into detail
on like characteristics you look for and
[SPEAKER_00]: males and females.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went over so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of this episode,
I'll definitely link the previous episode
[SPEAKER_00]: we did together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any viewers or listeners that haven't
tuned into that episode can go to it after
[SPEAKER_00]: this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feminized seeds are becoming more and
more popular, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You had mentioned kind of pollen chucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a male and a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you cross them and then you get seeds
out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's going to give you regular
seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those seeds, when you plant them,
some are going to turn out to be males and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them are going to turn out to be
females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can create feminized seeds
instead, which is a whole different
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of common ways to do it are with
STS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way to do it was with collodial
silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people use both of those
things in order to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about creating feminized
seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, great question, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I went on, when I first started
the feminized seeds run, first I was
[SPEAKER_02]: against it because let's start there
because the truth is, feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're stressing the out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're stressing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're constantly with the sprays and
whatever you do, there's a few ways to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it because you can use a spray or you
could use stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could literally stress the plant
enough to where she hermaphrodites herself
[SPEAKER_02]: separate from the other plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have one female in there that
you want to stress and split, you could do
[SPEAKER_02]: that in a separate tent and just stress
the heck out of that female.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you could do the spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I went online, I was totally against
it because again, I like the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: process and the photos and doing this
natural way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, everybody was yelling for
FEMS and I wanted to help our network out,
[SPEAKER_02]: make it easier for beginners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I go online, I buy the sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: The issue with a lot of the sprays online,
which are good, some are good and some are
[SPEAKER_02]: not so good, is that you don't know how
much of silver nitrates in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know their recipe and they're
not gonna tell you the recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they place it on the bottle,
they could be lying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you buy these products and now you
spray and you follow the directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it works and sometimes it
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now you're kind of like,
you know, this spray didn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I invested a few hundred dollars
into different sprays and it just didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I kept studying and doing research
and I found out that you could really make
[SPEAKER_02]: your own spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of where, that's where
I started.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bought my own silver nitrate crystals
online and then sodium theosulfate online,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are the two, the A and B.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anytime you see sprays out there,
they're like mix A with mix with B.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I make my own A and B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've done a lot of research,
a lot of experimenting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can overdo it and stress the plant too
much to where she won't even flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've seen people where they had the
plant won't pollinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll have flowers, but it won't
pollinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because the spray may be off or
that genetic just doesn't want to work
[SPEAKER_02]: well with the A and Bs and whatever the
case may be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you could not do enough and she only
has a few flowers that tend to set.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, may drop some pollen,
but not enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the lighting has to be on point and
whatever else, because that has an effect
[SPEAKER_02]: on the pollen and the production as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I started to make my own mix and
start to experiment on my own,
[SPEAKER_02]: I started to see much more success.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you get into the world of S1 and then
you would then get into the crossing of
[SPEAKER_02]: others.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't know that when you,
when you reverse a female and she's
[SPEAKER_02]: reversed and you pollinate another
offspring, then you still have to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have to, but phenol hunting that
new offspring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if she sex, S1 is basically sexing
herself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you flip that, when you flip her
and you spray and she starts dumping on
[SPEAKER_02]: herself and she sex herself, that's an S1
because she sexed herself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, though that offspring is going to
carry almost the similar characteristics
[SPEAKER_02]: of the mom because it's almost like a
replica, almost like a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem with S1 is a lot of times
they are, because it was stressed and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a herm, a lot of times you're going to
find some hermage going on with the
[SPEAKER_02]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you phenol hunt that out?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, but again, it still carries that,
that genetic makeup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it's so possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, does it herm the entire plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, what you'll see is it a herm the
bottom, some of the bottom buds and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can pluck those off and just continue to
allow it to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it affects and opens up a
few pollen sacks, you get a few seeds or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, but for the most part,
that's why I'd never really wanted to do
[SPEAKER_02]: fems because I know what we're doing to
where we're playing God and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: creating, that's like us trying to create
a, you know, take my cousin and create
[SPEAKER_02]: another cousin just like that cousin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but when you go into the, another
offspring, your chances of hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of, they go down because then you're
taking it and it's not a self pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's using the reverse pollination on
another offspring, another female.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gives you a wide array of some herms
in there, some not from that aren't herm,
[SPEAKER_02]: that would herm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, you need to phenol
hunt that you need to phenol hunt those
[SPEAKER_02]: offspring, have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: From there, you find a female that is
stable and you could then work that female
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, to bring her to a stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, to, without cloning,
if we find a female and you want to use
[SPEAKER_02]: that female in, in let's say, for feminize
that stable one, you would then have to
[SPEAKER_02]: ask one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd still have to ask one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but using, you know, anybody out there
that's looking to do it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and really do some research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's tons of research online now,
you know, you can go anywhere online and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of find information about
creating your own type of spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say start there and experiment
and, and kind of come up with your own
[SPEAKER_02]: recipe, because ultimately what works for
me is working in my room, my environment
[SPEAKER_02]: and my setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, are there sprays out there
that'll work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's, there's sprays that'll
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of these sprays, I actually
got one of the sprays before and it didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing to keep in mind is the shelf
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually got the product and waited a
year and then tried to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by then it just, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you get light on it as well,
it kind of spoils it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to keep it in the fridge and I keep it
in the fridge and it lasts about 90 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I've come to find out with my
sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't let them go any longer than 90
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still think that's long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think I do like 60 days and it's
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll run through a crop and then run
through another, and then I'm already
[SPEAKER_02]: making another mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, like I said, like I said,
you know, people got to understand we're
[SPEAKER_02]: in a market that is very hot, even though
it's about seven years old, it's still at,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's still peaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are out there trying to get it
any way they can.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making all types of crap and you
know, making a profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if it works or not, damned,
if you do damned, if you don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they made their profit and they're
off, they're off getting someone else's
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just got to do as much research as you
can and kind of figure out your own recipe
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the alternative to buying a product
would be to create your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, you've got the two
different things that you created,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if you're serious, if you're,
if you're being serious about this,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're just trying to make money next
month or two months or three months,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're just trying to make some money
and trying to hustle, then, then,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you need to stop because you're going
to run into brick walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: You end up, you're going to, you know,
create crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're in it for the long
haul, then study, you know, the more you
[SPEAKER_02]: learn, the more you earn, study,
figure it out through, through knowledge
[SPEAKER_02]: and then experimenting and trial and
error.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, then bring something to the
market that the people and yourself can
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause then your name will, you know,
kind of ring a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with the STS, correct me if I'm
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's differences in how often you
should spray between STS and then
[SPEAKER_00]: collodial silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: The STS correct me if I'm wrong,
but it's once every four or five days you
[SPEAKER_00]: spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the collodial silver,
I believe is every day too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the collodial silver, yeah,
you, you, because of the, because of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount, I believe the STS,
that's why you would do it every four
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you know, it's, it's a much
higher concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could thin it out, but it's much
higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas with collodial silver,
yeah, you can spray, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: each day, which that's what I do for 14
days until the butt starts to sit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll spray and spray, they say spray at
nighttime, but you know, when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting, when you're not rocking with
20,000 Watts on one plant, I think you're
[SPEAKER_02]: okay to spray with lights on, but you
know, I do underneath and above and on the
[SPEAKER_02]: butt sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and after about two weeks,
you'll start to see the butt set.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now STS sprays, I never had any,
I had never had luck with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't, there wasn't much luck with
STS sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like I said, more of my silver
nitrate, collodial silver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I buy the crystals,
which, you know, then, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you move around, they, they, they
dissolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some, I have, I know people that
take real nickels, you know, a battery
[SPEAKER_02]: with some distilled water and they kind of
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that you're stripping the silver from
that nickel and that turns in,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you don't know the percentages.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to, like I said, there's just,
there's so many ways to skin a cat with,
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to creative films.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got to find your recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of already answered the,
my next question, which is if you create
[SPEAKER_00]: in front of my seeds, those offsprings,
are you going to have more chances of herm
[SPEAKER_00]: traits in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of already revealed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mandatory yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people say, oh, these plants
herm, well, no doubt, if you really
[SPEAKER_02]: understood how her, how FEMS are made,
it's made from her making a plant stress
[SPEAKER_02]: and hermaphrodite itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the, that's the, that's the
downside to FEMS.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only downside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can get into weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get into some other things,
but that to me, that's the ultimate
[SPEAKER_02]: downside is that if you're going to run
FEMS, anybody that's out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just getting involved in this game
and, and he's saying, Hey, I just got away
[SPEAKER_02]: from autos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm jumping into FEMS.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to keep in mind that this is one
of the cons of feminize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you could blame the breeder
all you want to, but as long as you
[SPEAKER_02]: understand and you know, the rules of
engagement, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should know what you're getting into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then should you avoid breeding with
feminize seeds because of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's, that's a give and take
because ultimately I've bred with FEMS
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I've seen actually is my photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what, this is why I have the tester
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why we do so many different tests
of, I mean, I have people in, in Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_02]: South Africa, Columbia, and we're all
testing different environments and all
[SPEAKER_02]: this net.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've, what we found from the
thousands of people is that you get a
[SPEAKER_02]: higher return on females when you use FEM
in a photo and a crossing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that, I found that like,
you still get males, but you're,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you get more females out of the
batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've created your mixture,
whether it be STS or collodial silver,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're spraying the plants,
the frequency that it needs to,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plant reverses, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a female and it reverses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts creating pollen sacks and then
starts to release pollen shortly after.
[SPEAKER_00]: At what point do you pollinate a female
plant in order to obviously pollinate that
[SPEAKER_00]: and then have that female create the
seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not doing the self pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's a, that's a good
question because you want to start
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying a week before you start breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and this is where I messed up a lot in
the past and anyone out there that's
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this is a great tip is that you
don't want to put your female plant in
[SPEAKER_02]: that tent and then all of your other
females and start spraying and call that
[SPEAKER_02]: week one a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to start spraying your female
plant a week before you do the flips.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're still in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I do is I grab my female and I kind
of go outside or, you know, take it out
[SPEAKER_02]: and or whatever, and I'll spray that plant
and then put it back into one week prior
[SPEAKER_02]: to, to flipping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then when it's time to flip,
yeah, all the plants are in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're already going into flip mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I continue to do my
spray and what this does is it gives the,
[SPEAKER_02]: it gives the female plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: An opportunity to start her, start the,
start the confusion, if you will,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Oh man, I got hit with this spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm being stressed out,
you know, time for me to convert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by the time week one of flower
comes into play, she's already,
[SPEAKER_02]: she's already, you know, I would say,
you know, mentally ready to convert to her
[SPEAKER_02]: Maphidite.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now when, when you get to week one and
week two of flower and you're buds are
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to set, she's now starting to
produce the pollen at which if you did it
[SPEAKER_02]: and let's say the plant is in week three
or four and the buds are already starting
[SPEAKER_02]: to set.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that the, the take from her to
the, to the other plants, they're not as
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not as good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not as, not as good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm not sure why, but I've tried it
numerous times and it just doesn't take as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when you do the week prior to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually when I'm doing it, cause I do in
breeding, I have one cross, which you're
[SPEAKER_00]: well aware of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, uh, I bet you, I bet you it's a
chill out OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had best luck around day 20 to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's when there's so many
different pistols showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I hit that with the pollen,
man, I get a real good yield of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now after it's pollinated, you've got to
obviously grow the plant throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole flowering stage and then harvest the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any different growing techniques
for growing those pollinated plants versus
[SPEAKER_00]: just regular plants that you're growing
for a flower run?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for example, I had a breeder on it
before he mentioned that for pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, he continues on the veg feeding,
according to the nutrient chart for the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire run.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says that he swears that he gets a
better, I don't know if it was yield of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or more healthier seeds,
but he, he just stuck to the veg light,
[SPEAKER_00]: a veg nutrient regimen for the whole grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do anything like that, whether it
be nutrients or lighting or environment or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do pull back on my nutrient feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, be it that when you're trying to
grow flower that is supreme, you're,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're, you're adding your microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your enzymes jamming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're really dialed in and you're
tweaking things as you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're really focused on, uh,
the, the, the quality of the bud that is
[SPEAKER_02]: being produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cool part about seeds is once you,
once you, once the pollen starts to hit in
[SPEAKER_02]: those pistols, you talking about start
turning brown, then you know, it took
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning that, you know, when she's in her
28, 30 day of flower and you start seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: those brown tips start to start to do a
little curl and get brown, the sperm hit
[SPEAKER_02]: that ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: She knows she's knocked up, baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so like, you know, it worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that point on, I just make sure
she's nourished.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't, I follow my same regimen
as if I was flowering, but I pulled back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't need to invest into tons of
microbes, tons of enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still offer that to the plant,
of course, but I kind of pull back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I also do is I stress the plant a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what I'm not stressed, like it's going
to harm itself, but I stress her in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of allowing her to pull nutrient up and
pull the food up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if I just make her lazy,
then what I notice is those seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: the development of the seeds don't start
to form as fast as I want them to,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, meaning they, they're, they're not,
uh, it's hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just not forming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when, when I pull back on the nutrient
and I make the plant say, where's the food
[SPEAKER_02]: and start searching throughout the media,
the plant starts up taking much more
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I start seeing the, the,
the, the food actually goes to the seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause remember, you know, it's all about
the seeds at this point, not the flower
[SPEAKER_02]: and the flowers still budding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you still get bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, you still get all this and
that, but it's all about the baby and the
[SPEAKER_02]: womb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, just like a prenatal pill,
if you know, a woman taking a prenatal
[SPEAKER_02]: pill is really targeting specific
nutrients within her body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that prenatal is specifically going for
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's when I still push my phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still push my magnesium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still giving this plant what it needs,
but I'm pulling back because I want the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to consume and to pull those
nutrients up without being lazy and
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, ah, this stuff is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to eat today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good on that note.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just my philosophy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when it comes to trying different
methods, I've never tried doing a veg all
[SPEAKER_02]: the way through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, you know, because the seed is still a
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still flowering and it's still
producing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm not sure there's much
research out there that that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, says, Hey, this is the right
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we still, I still produce a lot of
seeds from, from the way we perform it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm gonna have to give, give it a try
on the whole veg, you know, on the veg
[SPEAKER_02]: run.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really don't change much of anything
other than pulling back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to use LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed that LED lighting works
better than HPS and CMH.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much more softer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as harsh on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember they're already being stressed
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I say this in terms of the female,
we are, we are herming or we are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, reversing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed that there's more pollen with
LED lights than, than using CMH or HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only thing I could think of is
that it's, you know, it's a lot harsher.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's much more PPFD being, being hit
from a CMH or HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after you've pollinated it,
you're not actually just going until the
[SPEAKER_00]: normal harvest window, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of pushing it longer than the
normal harvest window, according to the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's not a regular flower run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually, your goal is the seeds to
be developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I heard roughly eight weeks after
pollinating is the earliest that she
[SPEAKER_00]: should harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you let the plant go until you
actually harvesting?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an interesting question because
ultimately I've had stuff finished in six
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, meaning the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the bud wasn't done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I found interesting was
the bud wasn't done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you scope it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're clear as day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the seeds are dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the blueberry that the DJ
short that we found and we hunted in the
[SPEAKER_02]: F6, since they finished in a, in a 60 day
to 75 day timeframe, we've noticed that in
[SPEAKER_02]: six weeks, these seeds are already damn
near developed and they're, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: complete.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the bud wasn't done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it still needed another week or
so, but you know, or maybe even two weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's, that's on that note.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there are some that you need to push
like the cardiac cookie that we worked on
[SPEAKER_02]: a chill out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had to let it go a lot longer
because it has a lot of sativa traits in
[SPEAKER_02]: her.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the seeds form where your chill out was
done two weeks prior.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that has to do with the
Pakistani that's in there because you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, the Pakistani is much more of an
Indica driven.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's going to finish a lot
sooner where my sativa is more,
[SPEAKER_02]: my cookie is more sativa like 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could see that happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it really depends on the genetic
and how the genetic is going to perform.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like saying, again, you go back to
humans or, or animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's like, say, you know,
you take 10 women that are pregnant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not every single one of them is
going to go to that nine month marker.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be some ladies that are
ready to pop out a month early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some that are, you know, you know,
just different times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you start factoring nutrients and
all this and that, and you're finished and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so many variables that,
that, that takes shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I seem to allow to, I, I watched the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pay attention to what she's telling me
and I kind of nurture her until it's time
[SPEAKER_02]: to give birth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you, you could tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing I do is I kind of,
um, because the top in the bottom,
[SPEAKER_02]: top middle and bottom are all going to
give you a different look.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the top buds are going to be a
bit wider or a bit, and they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: developed yet because it's new growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The middle is going to show you exactly
what's going on in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get the bottom,
you're going to get the dark seeds because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're, they've been done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so what I do is I kind of pluck from
the top middle and I kind of see where
[SPEAKER_02]: that's at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I can take my fingers and I could
start to crush, um, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: in it, in it crushes in its water,
then I know that the top piece still has
[SPEAKER_02]: some time to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the middle, if I could push my
fingers together like this on the seed and
[SPEAKER_02]: I could feel some, some strength,
I know that where she's on, she's right
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other trick is there, the tricky part
is that sometimes the seeds aren't dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't talk about the gray
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love gray seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, gray seeds are, they're the truth
to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've let them go 12 weeks and they
don't get dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a breed of their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're aliens.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't get dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're grays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but what I've come to find out is
that you're a lot more sativas and a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more of the, the silvers, the silver hazes
and the silvers, you know, they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they, like, like my Cartier cookie,
you're going to, they're gray seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're hard, like rock hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you've got to put a slit in them and
soak them in water for four days to get
[SPEAKER_02]: them to even pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just extremely hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you get some that are just soft and
dark and real easy to pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, again, to answer the question,
you want to pay attention to the plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: what the plant is saying and kind of,
you know, it will be nosy and week eight,
[SPEAKER_02]: seven, eight, nine, and maybe even 10 to
really determine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll pluck a seed out and you'll
know it's finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll know, you'll know, okay,
we can hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a misconception about the
gray seeds, something that's not viable or
[SPEAKER_00]: it's unhealthy, came from an unhealthy
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just definitely a
misconception there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best I've ever grown come from gray
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to clarify on the, uh,
talk about Pakistan Valley, the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: time for that is 45 to 55 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a faster one, which is one of the
things that really sparked my interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and one of the reasons why I like to
use it for my breeding project was that it
[SPEAKER_00]: had that fast flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I tried to bring out in
further generations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you made several crosses with the
chill out OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to ask why the chill out OG,
what did you see in it that you liked?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Pakistani, I wasn't too worried
about because I, I, I did like the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: that it flowered early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew that, okay, whatever we do with
this, it's going to bring the flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: time down on my, that Cartier cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I knew it would add a bit more
size and a bit more indica to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's, that's one thing I liked,
but that wasn't why I chose inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your Tahoe OG, which is one of my
favorites, one of my favorites stingers,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, out there from all the cultivars
I've ever run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, another classic is, you know,
peanut butter breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you start digging into the
peanut butter breath and those are,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are two classics to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I was looking at the background of
it, I was like, this is, this is pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: cool that it has two, uh, two flavors and
two offsprings that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I already knew exactly what I could do
with those considering I have a cookie
[SPEAKER_02]: already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an OG already, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's our OG Supreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Bugatti is bananas because,
you know, the Bugatti's got the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the gorilla runs in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got a gorilla glue runs and then
it's hit off with biscotti.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're talking gelatos and all these
different flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already new that we would be able to
bring what you have into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew you were working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since it is an F3 that I captured,
I knew that I would be able to find
[SPEAKER_02]: something out of that mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be easier to target what I needed to
find out of the seats you sit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really I'm, uh, I was in search for the
Tahoe OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to probably pop 10,000 seats
to find that one one that is truly Tahoe
[SPEAKER_02]: OG leaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I didn't get lucky on that,
but I was able to pull out the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Pakistani, which is dominant in,
in, in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then also some of the Tahoe is in
there, but the, the peanut butter really
[SPEAKER_02]: showed more with, you know, that I
grabbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's fine because again,
uh, you know, it's gonna, it's gonna blend
[SPEAKER_02]: well with the Cartier cookie and a
compliment that really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really looking to, cause I'm working
on my OG line right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a lot of cookie work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, I want to take it back to the
OG side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I was really like geared up
to look for, but, you know, I add some
[SPEAKER_02]: more cookie to the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because these will be F1s and the sour
OG, we're going to find a lot of OG
[SPEAKER_02]: powerful genetics within that sour OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we find it in the runs,
the, the, the Bugatti.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think we find it with the
cookie side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what makes this project kind of
cool is that we have three different
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties and they're really going to have
three different flavors, but be some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the best of the best sitting up there
with, with some of the best cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll say it right now.
Guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to hear about people who've
grown the chill out OG, a bread with the
[SPEAKER_00]: chill out OG, like what they like about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really interesting to hear your,
uh, your aspect on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get deeper in some of the
cultivars that you created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's narrow it down to kind of the ones
that you've worked with and use the chill
[SPEAKER_00]: out OG across with Cartier cookie,
the Bugatti and the sour OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the three main ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with Cartier cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a story about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's the taste, smell effects,
how does it grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody brags about their children.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their children are the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to brag about my baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for good reason, because the number
one in the creation of the Cartier cookie,
[SPEAKER_02]: it put me on the couch because of
financial with my wife and the,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I did to get her to create it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, number two, my friends and people
thought I was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so how it all started was I had a
delivery service and the delivery service
[SPEAKER_02]: was going well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where big Mike comes in with the
sour OG, because I was buying flour off my
[SPEAKER_02]: guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that was part of my,
my system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was growing my own seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had everything that you thought of on
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kept things rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our delivery service was doing very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was just like every other delivery
service.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only thing that was different was my
personality character.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in our, in our delivery people were
just, we were top notch in that field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew that only way for us to be
separate and to be different from anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: was to create our own genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew it would take a while and I
knew it would take money.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the time in the era of the cookie
era, 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, you had burner out there and
you had all these, you know, the cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: really started to take flight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, fast forward to 2015 during this
time, I'm still experimenting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I came across a guy online who won the
2015 Kent high times cup for his
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not gonna bring his name up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not, cause the dude, the dude is
something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's not too liked in the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but what I enjoyed the most of that,
I knew what he had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's almost again, it's almost like
breeding dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, somebody that won this,
won a, won a, you know, a champion has
[SPEAKER_02]: champion dogs and you're not trying to buy
the dog from about their character.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying to buy an offspring so you
could do something with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I looked at this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was really jamming on the East coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure a lot of people have heard of
them, but I said, Hey man, I reached out
[SPEAKER_02]: to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Hey man, I like what you got
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at this time I'm buying cuts for
like a hundred dollars, 150.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked him, I said, Hey man,
would you be willing to sell me a cut?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, yeah, one cut $2,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, man, this dude is this dude
smoking crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, this dude is smoking crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll never give somebody, you know,
that this was my mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I kept talking to him and he's
like, bro, you just don't know what you
[SPEAKER_02]: got.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like really pushing the fact that,
you know, you don't know what you have
[SPEAKER_02]: once you get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, whatever man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked about the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he used the animal cookie and then he
used another Girl Scout cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, he had proof that he won a 2015
cut for his concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's proof in the pudding and it was
ringing in at 31 to 33%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew I had to have that and start
with that creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we continued to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He finally sold me a cut man, Chris,
one cut for a thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: He decided, he said, okay, bro,
I'll give you three cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, now let me, let me explain this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me three cuts unrooted for a
thousand and sent them to me unrooted for
[SPEAKER_02]: a thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talking about shake them up,
roll them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cause if they want to root it,
he's not giving me a refund.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if he didn't send them, I wouldn't,
you know, so my friends were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, are you crazy, bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have just went to Cali and all
this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, no, man, I I'm going to
roll the dice on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he ends up sending them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I go to Western Union, I send them the
money and lo and behold, they show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I immediately put them in and I start to
grow them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I get ahold of a guy in Cali.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some connections in the Bay area and
Southern Cali, you know, I've been had
[SPEAKER_02]: connects there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I reached out to my connect and I said,
yo man, I'm looking to get some clones,
[SPEAKER_02]: but some, some top-notch clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my search guided me to a guy named
cookie Dave.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was known in the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people know new cookie day from
the 2012 era.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, but cookie Dave,
he wasn't trying to give his females off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought this was a perfect time
because like I'm down to buy a male cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now who buys male male cuts, but then I
get hit with another thousand long story
[SPEAKER_02]: short.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this point, my wife is like,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you thinking of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: All is that your delivery service is going
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to make anything better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she just didn't understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, cause I used to breed dogs and
we had champion dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew that the only way for us to
become champions in this world and
[SPEAKER_02]: separate ourselves was to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bought it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We argued bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I slept on the couch few nights cause I
wasn't trying to hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, the male plant came.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew the females out from what was sent
to me from the female side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, things worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I crossed those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started to work on that line and I
couldn't find anything for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, um, we had a, I think it was 2016
or 17.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had, uh, I entered the Earl cup here in
Phoenix and I don't ever enter cause I
[SPEAKER_02]: only entered the Earl cup because I didn't
want to send my stuff off to the labs to
[SPEAKER_02]: get tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you enter in the Earl cup,
you can go under an alias and put your
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff in there and they were going to run
tests for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's like 2016, 17,
right on that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the reason why I entered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I entered it and, uh, my offspring that
I created came back at 31, 31,
[SPEAKER_02]: seven or something like that with a 4%
CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was ecstatic because I didn't care
about winning the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't care about any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just knew I was working on something and
I carried the female line and I had the
[SPEAKER_02]: cookie from the male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew I had something very powerful,
very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's basically was the base and the
starting point of my, of my genetic line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I have some to this day,
it's what eight years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still have, it's not the original,
but I still have the cut from the cut from
[SPEAKER_02]: the cut from the cut from the cut of the
very first one that I, that I produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I even done some back crossing where I
kept the original, went down the line and
[SPEAKER_02]: came back to keep her strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the reason why people say,
how did you get 79 cultivars?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not truly 79 cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm doing is I'm working my line into
other cultivars to keep that genetic I
[SPEAKER_02]: created strong because then I go down and
come back to some originals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's keeping, that's why when you grow
the blue faces, when you grow a lot of my
[SPEAKER_02]: work, the antidote cookie, you see the
original in there and it still holds the
[SPEAKER_02]: power because my goal in the beginning was
to get power and flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are two difficult things to do when
you're trying to create a genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't care who you are, where you're
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some top elite flower and I'm
like, Ooh, Ooh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, Ooh, Ooh,
flavors there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, this is like smoking on a
flavored cigarette, electric cigarette or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting those two to match is very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we were able to do with
the cardio cookie is, is bring that now to
[SPEAKER_02]: now to, to add to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it was done, not only did we get
it tested, it did really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking for the Earl cup results the
other day to, so I could, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: put more proof on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we did, uh, when we did the
research on everybody that entered,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was nobody even close.
[SPEAKER_02]: The closest was like 25, 26%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told Jim Morris, who is the owner of
the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called him up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, man, Jim, there needs to be a word
for the highest TAC content, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is bull.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is BS, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least, you know, da da da.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, ah, but the judges,
they go off flavor and all this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all can have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, so I just, I knew what I
had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, now we, now it's time to go take
it from the garden to the people,
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kid you not.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the bud is so fire that when we ran
out, people would put down 250,
[SPEAKER_02]: 300 for before I even started the next
crop for their, for their OZ.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were doing pre-orders for this
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: No BS pre-orders out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was blowing us away because like,
you're already giving me money for a
[SPEAKER_02]: product that isn't even in the soil yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's magic, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I started the line, I knew I had
to come up with, you know, I had to start
[SPEAKER_02]: with that as my base.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that created so many offsprings.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at my website there,
anything that says Cartier cookie,
[SPEAKER_02]: we got the Cartier cookie BX, which is
back crossed to the original.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the BXF 33, which is the 32
offspring that was, that's a bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but no matter what, anything with the
original Cartier cookie in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: supreme hands down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a connoisseur, you know what
time it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got into the Bugatti, the Bugatti.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a cool story about that because I
really wasn't focused on the Bugatti.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not, again, I'm big in the
flavor, but you know, I, what I do like
[SPEAKER_02]: about the Bugatti is the gorilla glue and
the runs that's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gorilla runs that I, I created those
two and, you know, made my own blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I brought it to the biscotti
because everybody was talking about runs
[SPEAKER_02]: and biscotti at this time, you know,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the name sale and this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I made that mix, I, I,
I knew it was fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a great strain to have in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it was fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it was on point, but there was a
guy in my group.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name was Cliff Hall and I helped Cliff
out so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was part of my tester organ in the
tester club.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he got the, a pack of Bugatti.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was with some of the first,
one of the first people to run the Bugatti
[SPEAKER_02]: and he, he ran the Bugatti.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before I go into there, it's name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I named Bugatti because it dropped on
Halloween.
[SPEAKER_02]: So boo B double O O guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he was running the Bugatti and he
finds some, some, some magic inside of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he didn't pop all 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave 12 beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: He popped six.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had some magic come out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this time, he's training a guy in
Colorado named Carlos minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's trying to teach Carlos what I'm
teaching him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's relaying this information in this
whole nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, long story short, I didn't know
Cliff had cancer and I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew he was a burn victim that,
that gave him a lot of issues with his
[SPEAKER_02]: health.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't know he had cancer and Cliff
passed away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that was touching because
when I would talk to Cliff, I didn't know
[SPEAKER_02]: this man from a hole in the wall,
but he would tell me things like your grow
[SPEAKER_02]: hand is dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ran a lot of seeds in my past 45
years of growing and you produce some
[SPEAKER_02]: really great flower and keep going young
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just kept offering me these wise
words and these great compliments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was not being humble at the time
because I'm thinking, Oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'm, I know I'm making moves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm doing good things, but you
know, the words he was telling me didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: impact me until I knew that he was no
longer here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what he was basically saying is,
you know, when you have a gift or when you
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy something in passion and life,
you know, rock with it and run with it and
[SPEAKER_02]: make that part of who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all he was trying to relay to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the cool, the story doesn't in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he passes and remember he's teaching
Carlos how to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find out through Carlos, he reaches out
to me because he says, Hey, my friend,
[SPEAKER_02]: Cliff, who was in your network passed
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Oh, I was like, Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, but before he passed,
he sent me some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I was like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lemon pie face and a lot of stuff that
I was working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, he was, he wanted me to take
over his seeds and grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, I tried running the Bugatti and I
failed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, what'd you do wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: We went into the, what went wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, I'm not sure, but I got three
seeds left and I want to run these for
[SPEAKER_02]: Cliff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you know, bro,
go ahead and pop those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you find a female out of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause those were the original F1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I want to help you through an
entire crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: No money.
[SPEAKER_02]: No bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to help you through an entire
crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, bad, bad, bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he finds a female, just out of luck
finds this female and she's superb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we document the entire journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he starts to grow it out, gets his
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does a tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he blows it out the water bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was kind of like full circle
because that was Cliff's homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: That young man wanted to learn how to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: He washes the herb and you know,
does his own washing and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the young dude was able to grow the
Bugatti that was handed to Cliff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just this full circle of,
of, you know, this relationship and Carlos
[SPEAKER_02]: and I are really great friends to this
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually sent me the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Bugatti that I got now is the cut
that came from Cliff's pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the Bugatti that's gone into
the Chillado Jeep.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Carlos ran that and did one hell of a
job with my assistants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from this day forward, Carlos is
yielding like four or five bows in a four
[SPEAKER_02]: by eight when he was doing only a pound at
a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, his, his growing came up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, you know, it's something that we share
together with Cliff and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's, that's the story of the Bugatti
man and why it will always be part of our,
[SPEAKER_02]: and everybody in my group, they know,
they knew Cliff because Cliff was loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was in the group and oh yeah,
Cartier this and Cartier that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times like, I'm like,
you know, I don't, I don't need all the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you're, you're, you're dope and
I don't need all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just doing what I come here to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people knew who Cliff was when he
would always brag about me and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, he's best and all this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so when I told the story
about him, everybody, we, we all,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we, we, we felt Cliff,
but everybody knows that he was running
[SPEAKER_02]: that Bugatti too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a story on the Bugatti man.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to the Sauer OG,
like I said, it took seven years to get it
[SPEAKER_02]: from Big Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sauer OG is Sauer diesel, the origin
Sauer diesel from the early nineties and a
[SPEAKER_02]: OG Kush from the late eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this gentleman I'm speaking of is from
LA Watts, LA and he's 71 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's an OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not, he's not your, he's,
he's, he's not your person that just
[SPEAKER_02]: starts to grow last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when we talk about Paul and
Chuck in and then, so he goes by the name
[SPEAKER_02]: of Big Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people knew, you know, 15,
20 years ago, he was moving boats and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, there's industry and there's
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've majority of my career was in
the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's how I started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how, where I come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they went industry, he didn't want
any part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, man, my, my systems have been
working.
[SPEAKER_02]: My people smoke on me, you know,
all the brothers, we know people who know
[SPEAKER_02]: they smoke good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't need to go dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't need to go here or there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get it from, they get it from their
source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just the way it's been going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's who Big Mike was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he had this OG that was just,
just dumb good big yielding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great flavor, but he would never come off
a cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I offered him two Gs, three Gs,
five Gs.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: No boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're saying this ain't that
commercial boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This ain't that commercial is that true.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for the people right here is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but four months ago, you know,
cause age starts catching up on your ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you start getting older and you
know, you start thinking like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what am I doing with my life?
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I doing with all, you know,
what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Big Mike hits me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yo, you know, I used to get
herb off Big Mike cause that's how I
[SPEAKER_02]: helped on my delivery service.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, yo, I need a couple,
yo, I need one or two that break through
[SPEAKER_02]: my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so now he's really small scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't do anything crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of laid back, but you know,
he calls me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, he's like, Hey man,
come over here, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come over here and come hang out with your
boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, I was odd, you know,
cause I'm not in the streets anymore like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I go over and we're chopping it up and
he's like, Hey man, you know, you've been
[SPEAKER_02]: doing your thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see what you've been, I see what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He follows me in the whole nine and that
day, long story short, he blessed me with
[SPEAKER_02]: a cut of the sour OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says, you know, you know,
I can't keep this crap forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't take this with me when I go,
you know, and he's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've been jamming young, your young
blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: He worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he gave me that OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus he kind of knew from my, my circle
that I've been working on this OG lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, so he blessed me with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna tell you right now,
bro, in a garden, it's so hard when you
[SPEAKER_02]: show videos of people, you know,
cause I have it in some of the videos
[SPEAKER_02]: that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's connected with the chill out and
you touch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dog, if you, if you're a true connoisseur
and you remember the eighties and the
[SPEAKER_02]: nineties, I didn't start smoking to 96,
but if you remember in the nineties,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of that OG that was moving around
from East to West, that's that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's that, that's that original.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the, all the players, all the
hustlers, all the ballers that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that blaze from St. Louis,
all my connects and everybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you talk about an OG blow an OG,
that's him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the reasons why I wanted
to bring it to the stage, because number
[SPEAKER_02]: one, you have a great stage, what you're
doing, helping people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, on the same plane we're
on in terms of helping folks, knowledge,
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing great genetics to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I found that this was a place,
this was a time to allow a hidden OG like
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Mike to come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He don't want any recognition.
[SPEAKER_02]: He don't want, he don't want his face on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: He don't want to be, you know,
he just wants it to be known that,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, you know, a grower's hand by the
name of Big Mike from our local area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's let it be known.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, what better place to put it to
connect it with a man that's kind of got
[SPEAKER_02]: network cracking and those people all
around the world, unlike ourselves in the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding area.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have our network and our
breeding circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that's kind of why I chose the
sour immediately chose the sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the three that we have lined up for the
black Friday drop in the whole nine,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it means a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more than just saying, Hey,
these are some seeds we're just putting
[SPEAKER_02]: out there and we're trying to make some
money because I'm gonna tell you the
[SPEAKER_02]: truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all going to go into the tester
phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you've been around and people know,
know what we had the tester phase is
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking 75% on all like dropping
down the dam to nothing because we want
[SPEAKER_02]: people to get it in their hands and to
test and to run and to experiment before
[SPEAKER_02]: we say, Hey, we found winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found classics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can chill out these crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and these are retail prices at which
people in our network and people in your
[SPEAKER_02]: network that come along and join this,
they will then be able to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: still live, live in and be part of those
discounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the future, uh, to continue to grow
some of this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more about legendary as opposed
to, uh, just create some stuff to put out
[SPEAKER_02]: there and to get some money off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's way beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three incredible stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I want to get deeper into
in future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the audience really wants to hear
stories behind genetics because well,
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes you go to a website,
you look to purchase genetics and you see
[SPEAKER_00]: the name and you see a picture and that's
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no background info.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to showcase that in a
podcast episode here, I think is,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, entertaining and add some
value for folks that are shopping for
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So appreciate you sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually just passed the hour mark on
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell listeners how they can find
you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, Cardi cross.com or nsgclub
.com the nsgclub.com is where we,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, bring people in to become part
of our network.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we have a great community on our
website.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've created a website with a good forum
area and also a group area to where when
[SPEAKER_02]: you get our genetics, you're able to then
grow our products and share within our
[SPEAKER_02]: community and kind of talk with other
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the same with the chill out and the
same with everything we got going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be able to join these, join these
forums or community and, and talk with
[SPEAKER_02]: them there, but you can find me there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not big on like Instagram and,
and you know, our YouTube channel,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause we get blocked so often with the
whole store deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of just laid back off on all that,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could just find me on my website,
Cardi crops.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could add me as a friend in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the other great thing,
Chris, is that, you know, I'm front and
[SPEAKER_02]: center.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever we put out, you have some,
there's somebody to answer to that,
[SPEAKER_02]: to that, you know, offspring or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I like to tell my people is
like, Hey, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not running from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not telling you something crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to hustle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want us to produce the best of the best.

[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, but big ups to you, man.
