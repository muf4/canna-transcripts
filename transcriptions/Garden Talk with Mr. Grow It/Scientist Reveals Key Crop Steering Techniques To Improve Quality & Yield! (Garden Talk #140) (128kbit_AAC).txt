[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we're going to talk all about crop
steering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there are many things that you can do
in the garden to steer your way to a
[SPEAKER_02]: specific result.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people do it to achieve a higher
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people do it to increase yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get into all of that in
this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_02]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started gardening with my grandfather
when I was single digits.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a master of home grow of every
kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of vegetables and fruits and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were based in Scotland where the
growing season is quite short.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was quite a good indoctrination
into just being around plants as a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't until many years later that
I got seriously involved and got into
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drove me to study genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really fascinated how some medicinal
plants would express certain compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: that weren't really present.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least not in as much abundance in other
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the driving questions
behind why I wanted to study genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that led me on that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there I went on to do a PhD in
plant science where I concentrated on
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pathogen interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I discovered a class of enzymes in there
and a specific signaling mechanism which
[SPEAKER_00]: had been overlooked in the whole cascade
when any bacteria is seen by a plant cell
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a really competitive side of
plant science and really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do so much in certain fields and I
was always one for branching out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from there I moved into work on
photosynthesis where we took a
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis algae which could
supercharge its CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically we were trying to reverse
engineer that so we could grow massive
[SPEAKER_00]: crop plants of all kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after I did that I joined with
Seedman's team essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a few different sides of the
business and I was involved in one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plant side of things that was
geared towards the legal medical industry
[SPEAKER_00]: in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over time I did more and more for
Seedman and their market in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was much more got to do with small
scale home cultivation and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a good wide berth of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that role I went to big outside
growers in the Caribbean or in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did also the small craft style
tents inside around different places,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a really good wide range of
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally on my story what was the
pinnacle part was partner up with Jorge
[SPEAKER_00]: Cervantes which was through Seedman as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to know each other and we became
really good friends actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's been quite instrumental in both
my understanding and learning side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things but also in my ability to express
what I'm trying to say because he's got
[SPEAKER_00]: like 40 years of experience writing
medical plant books and pushing it out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when times where it wasn't so
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my full circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm the head of cultivation for a
medical plants company based in Scotland
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've also got a few other projects
going on here and there in different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much formal education background which
is really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: From time to time we have somebody like
you that has formal education on the
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast and people just love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting real deep into things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get real deep into crop
steering here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah I know about you through Seedman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was introduced to you and you have so
many good articles on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend folks to Google Dr. Gary Yeats
Seedman and you'll see a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: different articles that come up that he's
written.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of good information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the things I've actually cherry
picked out of those articles to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: within this talk here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm excited to bring that particular
information to my audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's get into crop steering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we start with the basics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just talk to us like what is crop
steering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crop steering.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all do crop steering to a certain
extent whether we realize it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially it's directing the way the
plant grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outputs of the plant or sometimes even
the inputs that it's required to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crop steering is all about kind of
guiding the parameters in order to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific outcome or a specific I would say
trait because I'm a geneticist which
[SPEAKER_00]: basically means a specific expression of
the genes that allow for a certain thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's essentially what we're trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be anything from taking a variety
that's specifically mold resistant but
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't produce a lot of compounds for
example that are valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like taking one of those plants
and driving it towards making it more
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinally valuable or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the opposite way as well where
you've got a really good spread of the
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds you're after when you grow a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you want to kind of build in some
kind of resilience to that plant which
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe isn't already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crop steering is a little bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you combine crop steering with kind of
advanced phenotyping then you can really
[SPEAKER_00]: take a seed lot and really push it in
actually several directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like the analogy of if you give a
thousand seeds to it or let's just scale
[SPEAKER_00]: it back a hundred seeds the same hundred
seeds to 10 different people they could
[SPEAKER_00]: all pull something very different out of
that because they grow in a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: environment because they're looking for
something very specific from the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: they've actually got a lot of times
different standards on what they gauge the
[SPEAKER_00]: performance of the plant on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you combine all those things and you
sometimes get really really diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's happened actually with a
lot of the poly hybridization that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on in our industry for the last 30,
40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that started from a fairly small
gene pool and it's been amazing what's
[SPEAKER_00]: come out yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I'm mind-blowing how much variety
and different ranges of different things
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also still a whole lot more to
be tapped into.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway I digress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But combining the phenotyping with the
crop steering is really the sweet spot to
[SPEAKER_00]: driving an outcome from the plant that you
really need or you desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the basics of crop
steering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds a little bit more fancy than it
actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply managing the conditions and
the response of the plant for a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: output essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a good basic definition of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah for you Expanded, I appreciate
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is exciting to see different
expressions that can happen really just
[SPEAKER_02]: from different seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know each seed is its own pheno and
each seed can have its own expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really cool to be able to do such
as phenohunts for example and see these
[SPEAKER_02]: different expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes gardening fun in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bunch of strawberries growing
in my back garden right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what's the variation but
even within the same plant the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: come at slightly different times they can
taste quite different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the terpian profile on them seems
to be pretty different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm keeping little notes on that and
it's just super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now I can't work out any pattern
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems somewhat random you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a gardener were to start crop
steering what actions would you suggest
[SPEAKER_02]: that they take in order to make it
successful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so I mean it sounds really basic and
simple but listing the criteria that you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to meet is the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then obviously choosing the right variety
to match that is the second thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really what you want to do is figure
out from your growing environment where
[SPEAKER_00]: what I call the dials are which things can
you control and change and which things
[SPEAKER_00]: can you not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variables that you can control and the
others that you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's working within the confines
of them throughout my career and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: in other you know the versions of my life
that I've lived before getting to this
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been what I call a master of
limited resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking a fairly small amount of tools
and making something that would be quite
[SPEAKER_00]: unexpected from that range of tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what this is all about
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like okay you might only have a you
know 300 watt light and you may only have
[SPEAKER_00]: a kind of one by one tent but what can you
do with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people have really mastered crazy
little kind of niches within that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what it's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about driving towards fulfilling a
kind of potential if you will whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: that may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the variables are so vast that each
one of us can have our own little specific
[SPEAKER_00]: niche in that sense you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's almost unlimited when you
think about the amount of variables that
[SPEAKER_00]: go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah I would say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before you get started so make your
list have an idea of the dials and then
[SPEAKER_00]: really just start you know reading up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out as much as you can about what to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the stuff with the plants that we
are talking about it's not very well
[SPEAKER_00]: known.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not well documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: The science is a little bit behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got examples from other plants
and we've got an experience and we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of the greatest thing about this
community is they're just the power in
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of people who are out there
doing it for themselves and feeding back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you really want to do is
keep on course with all your parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then understand where you can change
those and leading to the kind of outcomes
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer the question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right so let's hop into the different
stages of growth and kind of the triggers
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can do in order to crop steer
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start with the seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lighting, environment conditions,
irrigation, nutrition all these things can
[SPEAKER_02]: be adjusted when you're crop steering
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe let's start with lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you recommend for say the amount
of PAR or spectrum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so one thing I would like to break
down with the light before we actually go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the specifics like that is I think we
mentioned before this chat that one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things I got interested in was the
different quality of light from indoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: from outdoor, from glass house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really interesting is that,
and I know this from my time working in
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, the PAR range is like
trimmed at the ends, at both ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't include the UV spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't include the kind of far red
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is just like, it's just an
interesting point because my understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: of physiology, both of those things are
pretty important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you just went by the textbooks you
would say oh well you can't do without
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know from experience you can very
well do without them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both you know generations of horticultural
plants that have been growing in glass
[SPEAKER_00]: houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of things from fruits and
vegetables right through to you know
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plants and also indoor as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the horticulture markets
thrive without the needs for these clipped
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrums if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing to consider though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like again part of crop steering is
understanding like so for the seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: stage and for lighting, if you've got a
kind of harsh environment, like I would
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest that you try and sow your seeds in
quite a harsh environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay if it's kind of cold do it on a
window ledge so it's inside but warm but
[SPEAKER_00]: not extremely warm and try and get the
seeds to germinate a little bit lower
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That builds in a hardiness and giving them
exposure to the outside early on as well
[SPEAKER_00]: really helps build up their stress
resistance for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you've got things like wind
resistance that they build up so they tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a little bit stockier if you put
them out right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing for, what was the next
one I was going to say, yeah for like I
[SPEAKER_00]: said with the UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So UVB light triggers a bunch of stress
responses in the plant which actually
[SPEAKER_00]: changes gene expression quite away
actually and there's a lot of things like
[SPEAKER_00]: it will help with UV protection actually
believe it or not which is ironic but it
[SPEAKER_00]: will also help with things like DNA
repair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever there is damage to the cells
from other, whether it be chemicals in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, whether it be extreme UV,
the plant can actually repair itself a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more readily if it's been exposed to UVB
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding that is important first
of all is what do you want to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve here?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a harsh environment you want
to prepare your seedling to be ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise if you've got a perfect
environment however, then what you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is literally live pretty much by your
favorite textbook or your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever light manufacturer you've chosen,
go by what they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found that oftentimes the best thing
to do is just stick to what it says on the
[SPEAKER_00]: tin to quote an old advert.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally what you want from the
seedling stage is a lot of blue light
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to red light, plenty green in
there, not too intense, probably I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: just germinating seeds as it just comes
out, like maybe 200 micromoles of light in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's a thing you
understand, micromoles per meter squared
[SPEAKER_00]: per second for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you would keep it on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you wanted to make your plant ready
for a harsher environment and you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a hybrid indoor-outdoor way of doing
it, then a UVB lamp which is now quite
[SPEAKER_00]: readily available with a lot of the LED
setups is probably worthwhile because like
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, it doesn't necessarily at that
stage increase anything in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal compounds or the overall yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it can do is buffer against some
of those stresses that are hard to manage,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you're basically giving your plant a
little bit of a head start in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: resisting various types of stress by
adding in that UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be my wee little top tip on
the seedling stage, would introduce
[SPEAKER_00]: something in the low blue spectrum,
in the UVC, UVB especially, because that
[SPEAKER_00]: will trigger a light complex called UVR8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was like only the
[SPEAKER_00]: early 2000s, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually in the lab in Glasgow that
discovered that during my undergrad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I've got a little bit of
insight on that protein, but it regulates
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not activated, you still get
activation of those things that regulates,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't get such a strong response.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I've seen plants chosen for
their specific phenol and then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: grown under glass and they don't,
they seem really susceptible to different
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the reasons why,
because they're not having that UVB
[SPEAKER_00]: activation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sorry to go on about that, but it kind
of sets us up for talking about light for
[SPEAKER_00]: the next phases of life as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you expanding on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also appreciate how you mentioned
the textbook PAR range and how that's
[SPEAKER_02]: really a bit outdated, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They say PAR 400 to 700 nanometers,
but the plant can utilize beyond 700
[SPEAKER_02]: nanometers and lower than 400 nanometers,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: UVIR, RRED.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm glad you brought that up
because a lot of people do know it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not everybody knows it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People might still be referring to the
textbook, which is a bit outdated,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, there's an extended range now
that we know that it does have an impact
[SPEAKER_02]: on the plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most are clipped at 700 nanometers,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a light receptor called
phytochrome B and that needs to see far
[SPEAKER_00]: red, which is 730.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this compound can see two different
spectrums of light and it needs the other
[SPEAKER_00]: one to convert it back to being ready to
receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one's an active form and one's an
inactive form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't activate it, then what
happens is the gene can overproduce it
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not getting that switch back
and forth at the protein level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the light would normally switch this
protein back and forth and that helps
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate the processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have that, the gene then,
the compensation for that is to
[SPEAKER_00]: overproduce the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, I don't know what effect that
has.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really been largely, you know,
it's not been hugely explored,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that is one of the mechanisms that
will be affected by capping your PAR range
[SPEAKER_00]: at 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same at the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got, you know, having a peak of like
a blue peak, like 355, maybe even,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a wee bit lower than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them capped at four,
it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even light receptors work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the kind of light receptors
involved in specific processes outside
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis, they're activated more
than that as well, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: right down to 280, down to the UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's crazy that that's completely
missing from a lot of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the stuff still grows pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's kind of blows my
mind how you can have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're saying, oh, you must have this,
but you can kind of get away with not
[SPEAKER_00]: having it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the plants will adapt for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, how about nutrition?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, generally speaking in the
seedling stage, it's often said that
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen should be more heavier than some
of the other elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Disagree?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any tips in regards to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so personally, my favorite way to,
you know, the way I've had the best
[SPEAKER_00]: results is actually just to have a hands
off approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get a really good soil mix,
just leave it, just water it, and just let
[SPEAKER_00]: it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've found that gives me the
best, because then what happens is between
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes and the soil and the plant
itself, they kind of steer themselves to
[SPEAKER_00]: what they need and what they want,
is what I've found, again, without getting
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific about it, because I can't back
that up necessarily with science.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my observation is that when you have a
good soil-based system, the plant seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: just you know, take care of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see much signs of any of these
issues you do in a hydroponic system where
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's really tightly regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have even just a change in
temperature of your nutrient, you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: a pH change, and then, you know,
you can see the effects in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like a soil-based system for that,
getting a really good mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge Cervantes put me onto chicken manure
as a good additivity soil as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've been experimenting with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year and the effects have been
tremendous, absolutely tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, yeah, there's a thing about
having high nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, I like a balanced blend
throughout, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the point I'm trying to
make through it all, is I kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be messing about guessing
what the plant needs as it grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, because again, not a lot of
that's based on science, a lot of that is
[SPEAKER_00]: just based on what people before us did,
and we're kind of just following suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even just a step back to the light,
a lot of old-school ways of thinking is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you increase light intensity up until
like week eight, and then you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all this, and it's just nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how it works at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just blast it away as much light as it
can take for as long as it can take it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what happens outdoors in
the sun, and that's what they've evolved
[SPEAKER_00]: from, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the best way to attack that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always try and find that I'll always
take the light to the highest level I can
[SPEAKER_00]: until I see a stress response in the
plants, and then dial it back a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, because that little stress response
actually helps them to take more light,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavier amount of light in the future as
well, so that's another little kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: crop-steering tip, is if you want your
plants to take a bit more light than they
[SPEAKER_00]: have done previously, even if you're on a
clone mother cycle, you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: retrain your plant to be high-light
responsive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the genotype will dictate how far
you can push that, but if you expose your
[SPEAKER_00]: young plant to an intermittent high
intensity, light, when you put it into,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, flowering, you give it a
little bit more than you had done before,
[SPEAKER_00]: it should be able to cope with it a little
bit better, and there's a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: epigenetic effects in there that are,
you know, it's basically controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: different gene expression mechanisms,
and again, preempting them seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow, I think I can, when I was
training, or when I was at uni,
[SPEAKER_00]: they called it plant memory, things like
this, you know, this idea that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: can remember if you give it certain
stresses when it's young, the plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: remember that when it's older,
but what it actually means is it can
[SPEAKER_00]: shortcut the response, you know,
it doesn't have to like learn what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on and then respond to it, it's already
done it, kind of like our immune system,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, when we've been immunized or
exposed to a bug before, we have those
[SPEAKER_00]: antibodies and we just, we can get rid of
it much quicker, it's kind of like that
[SPEAKER_00]: without being similar in mechanism,
but it's like that in concept,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you know what I mean, but yeah,
sorry, I deviate, but nutrient is,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I like a hands-off with my nutrient,
I don't like to overpower it, and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the light I go for top down, but the
nutrient I go bottom up, if you understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what I mean, I tend to be light on the
nutrient and see, and build it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than go with what's the most you
can take and that violet down,
[SPEAKER_00]: because again, it's just, you don't have
much of a chance to fix it if you go way
[SPEAKER_00]: over, you know, if you go a little bit
under, you can catch up in a few days with
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient, so yeah, no massive tips there
for me, other than just try and get a good
[SPEAKER_00]: mix, depending on your substrate,
but try and get a good mix of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that you want throughout the veg
period and give it that from the start is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, how about the vegetative stage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any tips for crop steering in
the vegetative stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, like, so there's a couple here,
like if you wanted to have, and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a little bit plant training as
well, right, but if you wanted to have
[SPEAKER_00]: like, only like what they used to call AAA
grade, you know, finish, let's just say,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can condition your plants for
different styles of cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultivation techniques,
so for example, in the vegetative stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you wanted to grow what we call the Sea
of Green style, which I'm sure you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: know, which is lots of plants close
together, you make this kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: little Sea of Green, because there's no
space anywhere, there's a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: economy, again, depending on the scale,
you're on, depending on what outcomes you
[SPEAKER_00]: want, it's a really good way of achieving
like a fast turnaround, consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, you know, if you have the clone
numbers going in there, and you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: even just do a single cola on each plant,
you can get like really high levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency, so that's good for like,
you know, for the medical industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, who have like kind of really
tight tolerances and what the compound
[SPEAKER_00]: level should could be, so if you're going
to grow for Sea of Green, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can, you basically want to ramp your
light, again, back to light, you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: ramp your light up pretty quickly in
vegetable and vegetation because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: probably got a short veggie time,
right, so you want that plant to put on as
[SPEAKER_00]: much mass as possible, so that was the
other thing I was going to get with veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: so rather than the nutrient itself,
I'll talk about the watering schedule,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I may, so combining that highlight with
a really good watering strategy,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's massively overrated,
I've looked in this plant a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can steer a lot of the crop with how
you water it, and again, whether there's
[SPEAKER_00]: feed in the water or not, it doesn't
matter, it's just the scheduling of
[SPEAKER_00]: delivering, you know, the liquid to the
plant's feet, let's just say, so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want the plants to grow fast, you know,
and really boost them on like lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: short bursts of feeder water early on in
the day, that's what I've found that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just if all in all, you're going
to consume, say, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight ounces in the day, but just say a
small rate, you're going to do eight
[SPEAKER_00]: ounces, you would do like two and two and
two and two, right, so rather than do all
[SPEAKER_00]: eight at once, or go four at the start and
four halfway through, you just do two
[SPEAKER_00]: short ones, or sorry, four short ones of
two throughout each day, I've found that
[SPEAKER_00]: that pushes the plants on, especially
linearly, you know, in height,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily in bushiness, but that
kind of pushes the growth rate up,
[SPEAKER_00]: so again, if you're doing single cola,
and you want, you know, a good apical bud
[SPEAKER_00]: there, and you're going to strip away a
lot of the secondary and tertiary,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, growth, that's what would be my
advice for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to bush the plant out in veg,
then two shots early, two shots late,
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger dot shots, is what I would suggest
with your watering schedule there,
[SPEAKER_00]: so those kind of two different,
you know, different types of accelerator,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, but you can start to get a
response from those at the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the first one with the short
bus, often, you can get that response out
[SPEAKER_00]: to the vegetating plants pretty quickly,
you can see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit counterintuitive to do short
amount of watering, but what basically
[SPEAKER_00]: happens is, if you will, the mechanism is
you don't give the plant enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: it creates more root hairs in certain
water, then you're just giving it enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to give it enough water,
but it's also pushing itself to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: find more water at the same time,
which means that its overall ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake water increases, you know,
as opposed to giving it a big shot where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's sitting in its own water,
it doesn't need to go searching for it all
[SPEAKER_00]: day, the roots don't tend to expand at the
same rate when you do that, but that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: technique you want to use in flowering
because you don't really want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: gaining root mass in flowering
necessarily, you want to have built your
[SPEAKER_00]: root mass by that point ideally,
you know, and you want all the growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the energy to be going into the top of
the plant, so yeah, that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: combining your irrigation and your
nutrient there again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm light on the feed, I like,
you know, getting the watering right and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the substrate right, you'll have
absolutely no problems through veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's what I've found.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's generally the, I like the early stage
of life, a lot of people like the finish,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I really like the early stage,
the first like 21 days, I just think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal speed of growth and amount of
change from this little pip into this
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, sometimes like 10 inch
tall plant and you're just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what, how did that do that in that space
of time, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, these plants grow so quickly,
it's incredible and appreciate the advice
[SPEAKER_02]: on the irrigation on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now some people believe in drought stress
as far as I've heard claims as much as it
[SPEAKER_02]: brings out the secondary metabolites more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any truth to that or is that just
bro science?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not come across any studies
suggesting that I do like the dry back
[SPEAKER_00]: technique, you know, when you're potting
up and stuff like that and let the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's pretty much what we're
referring to, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that for potting up, I like,
I'm not sure that, I just like it because
[SPEAKER_00]: it helps the roots expand into the new
pot, you know, beyond that, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what it does to, I can't imagine what it
does to tune the secondary metabolite
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways, but we know so little about that
as possible, you know, as possible that
[SPEAKER_00]: something there is connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science is nothing else surprising a lot
of the times when these connections are
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the ones about, I don't know if
you've ever looked up the mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulation, which is a technique where
you basically create vibrations around or
[SPEAKER_00]: on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's reported to increase all
sorts of secondary metabolites and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's companies now set up to go
come to your facility and set up
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical vibration stimulators and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all sorts of things that we
don't understand yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's possible, but I've not seen
any evidence for that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much more to uncover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one thing that makes this plant so
much fun cultivating it at least is like
[SPEAKER_02]: not everything has been uncovered.
[SPEAKER_02]: New things are being identified.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I love keeping up to date on that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You touched upon plant training a little
bit, but I want to get a little bit deeper
[SPEAKER_02]: because in one of the articles you wrote,
you mentioned plant training changes gene
[SPEAKER_02]: expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk to us a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think some context and a little
bit of background on how genes are
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed is relevant without getting too
technical about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People forget that a plant has DNA,
of course, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have an entire genome and every
single cell of their entire existence,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So every cell that makes up the roots,
every cell that makes up the stem,
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf, the thing, each one of them has
its own genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each one of those cell types have a
different way of expressing the genome,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have different genes that are
active versus ones that are inactive in
[SPEAKER_00]: other tissue types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true in cell types as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why a flower is a flower and a root
is a root, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They start from essentially the same
precursor, but they deviate down the line
[SPEAKER_00]: cell division and differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you say, oh, there's a gene
expression change, it doesn't always mean
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it can be locally to the area
that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a little bit of preamble
that I wanted to give in qualification to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you cut a plant, for example,
it doesn't necessarily mean that every
[SPEAKER_00]: cell expresses its genes now differently,
but there can be big changes at the site
[SPEAKER_00]: where you made that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is also signaling mechanisms
that do go through throughout the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and it can pream the plant for,
like I say, stress resistance and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your specific example, if you're taking
a clone, you injure the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut through the plant branch and then
you take the clone away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now forget about the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened at that site that you cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant has a wind response mechanism
that's evolved for millions of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has got to do, this is a deep,
kind of an advancement on the trait of
[SPEAKER_00]: herbivoreism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it be a small animal or insect
that chews on the plant, that eats the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant for its dietary needs, the plants
have got a response to that, whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: producing certain compounds that will
repel them, different tastes, whether it
[SPEAKER_00]: be some plants have developed spikes and
needles, like stinging nettles,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, to try and repel that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a whole tens of millions of
years of evolution and hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of years of evolution behind
those mechanisms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the other thing to bear in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when we're taking a cut and it's
nothing new to the plant, the plant's as
[SPEAKER_00]: well ready for an injury like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we can do there is we can make
the injury in a specific way at a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: time that we can try and direct some of
that expression and changes in genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the wound response mechanism itself,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one to pre-activate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the earlier that you can pinch out or
top a plant, generally the more hardy and
[SPEAKER_00]: resilient the plant becomes to that
specific thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, back to your crop steering,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily that you need to do
it now, but you want it to be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it later, so injuring the plant early on
in that respect can change the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression so that we get a better
response the next time you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same mechanism as I was talking
about earlier, the conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's the same formula,
the plant knows what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, in that sense it changes
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we have now in that site of injury
is a plant has to now decide what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do with that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing is it has to close it
up to stop infection, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a bunch of genes activated
there that weren't actually activated
[SPEAKER_00]: before in order to basically heal that
wound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what you normally get is new growth
that occurs from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kind of classic thing is if you take a
bit of a branch away to make a clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have two new ones that appear from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting change in expression
as well because although there's what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call the apical meristem, which is the
tallest part of the plant is where the
[SPEAKER_00]: main stem cells are in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also true that on each branch you
have an apical kind of dominance as you go
[SPEAKER_00]: up and down that branch itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you take away that apical
dominance from even a branch, not even the
[SPEAKER_00]: full plant, just from that branch,
what happens is because it starts back
[SPEAKER_00]: from the kind of stem cells, the meristem
cell, because the plant's symmetrical,
[SPEAKER_00]: you end up with two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know this phenomenon, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take a cut, you often get two
that grow back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's happening there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're changing, not actually,
that's actually has to do with gene
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually more to do with how the cells
differentiate because you've set them on a
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all triggered by the fact that
you've caused this wound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all like a series of gene
expression, protein receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a big feedback loop, which one
action results in another action results
[SPEAKER_00]: in another action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often that does result in a series of
gene expression changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very literally, that's what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then a little bit more holistically,
it's about readying the plant for the
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of things that's to come
as well, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: more stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you can mitigate the stress
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some things you want a stress
response, and some things you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: the stress response.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be able to do things and the
plant just keeps growing, doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the whole big battle between
pathogen and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pathogen resistance, sorry, and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pathogen resistance is great, but
sometimes what happens if the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't defend itself and it just keeps
growing, it ends up decimated at the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's been eaten alive by this bug
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, if the plant's
susceptible to it, what it does is it
[SPEAKER_00]: shuts down, it doesn't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It redirects its energy reserves and tries
to fight off the infection the best it
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it shuts down that side of the plant
and tries to regrow somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can another half of the plant because
it knows that's compromised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants are also really good at killing
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So locally, they'll kill certain cells to
stop the spreading infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can actually be quite widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant can actually just program,
it's called programmed cell death,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just completely destroy itself in
order to save itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, different parts of the planet
will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You even see it with, it's a bit of a
stretch, but the same thing is when the
[SPEAKER_00]: wilt leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a kind of similar thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, okay, that's done now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just cut off the supply of that,
slowly pinch it, and then it just is no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer getting any nutrients from the stem
and it withers and dies and drops off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's slightly different, but it's the same
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a buddy who super crops every
single branch and he does it very early in
[SPEAKER_02]: the vegetative stage and he swears that it
helps make the plant more hardy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just kind of confirm that there is
science to back it, that if you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this type of damage early on, it's going
to build up some sort of resistance,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some hardiness to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really cool to hear about the
details on how that works.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also genotype specific, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What variety you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will not take it so well,
because some will overreact to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get the right variety and the
right person's hands as well, I must say,
[SPEAKER_00]: because some of these things are quite a
delicate touch, even though they seem
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's such a lane for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variables are so vast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fascinating study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen all sorts of crazy things people
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, if you get results,
then keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's no science to back it up,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy who drives nails through
these stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy who really likes to use warm
animal blood for feeding the soil.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just strange things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they swear by these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there's all sorts of crazy
things that have come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think anymore now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some just really wild stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you're probably listening in a
response from the plant, which could be
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise attained.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't necessarily always need to be
that extreme to get that response.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The supercropping thing is, yeah,
but I bet he gets a lot of yield as well
[SPEAKER_00]: from doing that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've got a lot of really good
kind of top buds, essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the main reasons why he does that
is because it helps with the strengthening
[SPEAKER_02]: of the branches, he claims.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you get into the flower stage and
you've got all these buds on the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's less floppage of those branches
because they're stronger from that super
[SPEAKER_02]: crop early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's what he claims.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant training in general, you're doing
two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically restructuring the
architecture of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're also then conditioning it to be
able to take that and to be maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: heavier branch yielding because it can
take the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the first plants that we ever
grew, they were extremely floppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You needed like four layers of net because
it was just like flopping off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, what would be, in your sci-fi
mind, what would be the ideal way to do
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: To grow a medicinal plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be you plant the seed in a little
jar and then this just huge big bud
[SPEAKER_00]: appears, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no leaves, there's no stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's essentially what your mate
there is doing on a certain scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not sacrificing, but you're
compensating stem elongation and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that for a more stocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the plant's got a potential of
biomass as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: People always forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They break it down into the different
components, but a metric in a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: crop plants is just biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the biomass?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get it in the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The listing will tell you biomass per
area, tons per area, whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something we tend to talk as
much about.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit in the hemp, the hemp world
will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we tend to talk about, in medicinal
plants, we talk about dry weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plant, the point I'm trying to
make is that it has a genetic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually often based on biomass and
not necessarily the specific tissues
[SPEAKER_00]: within that biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen someone recently published a
paper and they had, because one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest missing components of the genetic
side was we don't have really good yield
[SPEAKER_00]: markers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have really good gene expression
markers for high yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But someone's recently just put some out,
so I've not looked into that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that would be interesting to see how
those correlate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, I would imagine it would be
very variety specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just given the variety of different ways
it can grow, I would think it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to find that master regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, again, for all other crops,
we tend to know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to know, oh, what's the biomass of
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a range there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would be really disappointed if
you didn't have that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're in the infancy with this plant
in terms of understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you had to do it under license for
so long, it's been so difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually do a massive work and have it
well documented and in comparable
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the biggest citizen science
project of all time in some senses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all just went out and done our own
thing for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're able to come together and share
some of that, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know in the States you guys are way
further ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm still reveling in the novelty of
having conversations like this and being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to talk about this openly and having
different levels of availability in
[SPEAKER_00]: different places as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes experience helps,
but sometimes it's less relevant to a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go in and tell your mate
how to cut his plants any better when he's
[SPEAKER_00]: super-scrogging to that extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any plant you're growing of any type,
just be humble and be respectful of what
[SPEAKER_00]: it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't try and overtake the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my mind, it's like wrapping it in
cotton wool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just creating this environment,
a little bubble for it to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual interaction with the plant is
the less the better, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: My next question kind of relates to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bud density is what I want to get into
next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another article you wrote, it was
something very interesting, really popped
[SPEAKER_02]: out at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that light schedule can
impact bud density.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you explain?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's two papers now,
publications that show this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, for many, many years,
we just went under the metric of 18 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of light during veg, 12 hours during
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always thought, well, why 12 hours?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like if it's just 12 hours that
activates flowering, then that seems awful
[SPEAKER_00]: close to the line to pick 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, it must be higher than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I can gather, if you averaged it
out, when is the actual flowering time
[SPEAKER_00]: initiated?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you averaged it out between a lot of
the varieties that we had data for,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found it was 13.5 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of them would be triggered into
flowering at 13 and a half hours of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: not 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what these studies did was they took
some of the plants that actually flowered
[SPEAKER_00]: under slightly longer days, like 14,
14 and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did a 14 and 10 schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a 12, 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they did a 10, 14 schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a 12, 12 schedule in the opposite
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they measured was how that
changed the morphology of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, what happened was the
shorter the day time, the smaller and
[SPEAKER_00]: fatter the buds were.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seemed like 12, 12 was kind of a
sweet spot, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it would be variety specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they found was if you want a good
balance between elongation and fattening,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you would probably hit 12,
12.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is a couple of buddies,
one of them, a shout out to Stuart Maxwell
[SPEAKER_00]: up in Vancouver, he did a few interesting
things, and he would augment the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he'd use 12, 12 to initiate flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he would push it up to 13 and a half
hours of light for three or four weeks to
[SPEAKER_00]: give it that extra photosynthetic
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he would dial it back down to finish
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I've come to realize,
and one of my personal tips is to dial it
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way down in the finishing weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you've had your boost week,
your big bloom onset, when you get most of
[SPEAKER_00]: your mass coming through after they can
end it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my head, flowering follows this
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's 10 week flowering, for example,
you'll have five weeks of, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at this, it's coming, it's coming,
it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have two or three weeks of just,
boom, fattening out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's starting to gain some weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that last few weeks doesn't look
like much is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's generally happening in my mind
is getting density, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I follow that pattern, and I apply
it to what we were talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: about controlling the light to control the
shape of the bud, then what I tend to do
[SPEAKER_00]: is after that boom phase, that two or
three weeks of boom phase between five and
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, I tend to dial it right down with
10 hours light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is that finish,
that density there at the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas normally it finishes on 12,
12, it just really comes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's evidence there in the
publications to show that that happens
[SPEAKER_00]: under that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But rather than do the full cycle under
one or the other, why not change it
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually like, I really like to stagger
the transition as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another little crop steering trick as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go from 18 hours of light straight
into 12 hours of light, you tend to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of days of the plant going,
whoa, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure this out, right, okay, I'm awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you kind of graduate it down,
I find that the plant tends to transition
[SPEAKER_00]: much smoother, and we get where we want to
be a little bit quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, is that a scientific claim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, it's just an observation
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I do that, and you can be quite
extreme, you can take two hours off every
[SPEAKER_00]: other day, but just do some kind of
incremental decrease towards 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to do it maybe over two weeks,
and just slowly, you know, an hour or so a
[SPEAKER_00]: day, give or take, some days you won't do
it, doesn't really need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a good programmable LED,
you can automate it to go from this to
[SPEAKER_00]: that over this amount of time,
which would be the ideal way of doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it just mimics a natural thing,
because one of the big things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: learned from this plant is the autumning
phase is really of the fall, you guys call
[SPEAKER_00]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fall phase of a plant's life is really
important, especially to the finish of
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the fall, we get less daytime as
well, as well as dropping temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But whenever we're talking about getting
color or getting a nice finish,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't often talk about the light,
we only talk about dropping the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature generally and giving only
water, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starve the plant a little bit and you
take away its temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why would you not go all the way and
then reduce the light as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, that has an effect on
how it finishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my experience tells me that I wouldn't
not do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to try adjusting the
light schedule in the future to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: what you had mentioned there, gradual
transition down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I haven't really
personally experimented with much.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only really experimentation I've done
with light schedules is 11 hours on,
[SPEAKER_02]: 13 hours off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some people are doing 10 hours on,
14 hours off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I personally need to go through
and do some more experimentation,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially since you mentioned that there
is a potential impact on bud density when
[SPEAKER_02]: it comes to messing with the light
schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, the plant isn't entirely
locked in to that because we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowering exists, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I find the same applies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you still reduce the light time and
give it a natural onset of fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you tend to just get a better finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a little flick of color coming
out, you drop the temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the nutrients, you give the light
down and even the autofowers tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: stiffen up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A wee bit in terms of they just feel a
little bit more compact at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that that pathway has been
superseded in some respects just by the
[SPEAKER_00]: life cycle of the plant and the autofower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, tricky to try to figure all this
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about autoflowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never considered that in this theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, it's something that, because of my
understanding of genetics, there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: awful lot of overlap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very rarely one on and one off
switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's often many different stimuli will
feed into a pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's multiple points within that
pathway that can be activated,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you know what I mean, depending on the
stimuli.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are basically this big mass of
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really responsive, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be because they're stuck in
the ground, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't run away from their problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to have a really good
adaptive strategy for survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plant that we're talking about
is probably one of the craziest in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of its ability to adapt, just really far
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super adaptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if we can take something that's
been grown, I mean, landrace is a good
[SPEAKER_02]: example of that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Grown in one environment for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we take in transition and
completely change up the environment
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions and it adapts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll still adapt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll still grow and you'll still get to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So super, super adaptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into the flower stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to know what tips or advice do
you have in regards to crop steering in
[SPEAKER_02]: the flower stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of mentioned a bunch of them
there about the kind of changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and stuff like that, the light
scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back to the light quality itself,
again, kind of fairly standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people know this, but you know,
increasing the light, sorry, the red end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the spectrum during flower is
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to make sure I have that 730 in
there, nanometers as well, because like I
[SPEAKER_00]: say, I like the mechanism to work as it
was designed and not necessarily to be
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe holding my plant back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's not always possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the jobs that I've had and the
facilities have a light that is limited to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but again, if I get to choose whatever
I want to do, then I'll make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: light is capable of going up that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I was saying I was a little bit
kind of like, you know, ease off with the
[SPEAKER_00]: feed and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do it, now is the time
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, flowering, again, not too harsh
too early, but by week three, you really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be really ramping that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in nutrient sky, you really want
to be starting to push it.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you get to week five,
really ramp it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, if you wanted to steer a
specific outcome over another,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's where I would maybe change
what you're doing with the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you an example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say your plant is adapted to,
no, let's go the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant produces a high level of
medicinal compounds, but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: specific, it's not particularly well
adapted to a cold environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but you know that the facility that's
grown this is going to get pretty cold at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, what's one of the things you
can do to help with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found that the temperature
correlation between what a plant optimally
[SPEAKER_00]: grows at, sorry, the temperature a plant
optimally grows at and what it can grow at
[SPEAKER_00]: is correlated with the feed schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you're growing slightly
colder, you ramp everything back,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the opposite end of the scale is also
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to really, you know,
if you're in a hotter environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually push it a wee bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within reason, biochemistry in a plant
operates optimally somewhere between 20
[SPEAKER_00]: and 30 degrees, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever we're in the lab and we're
doing like maybe taking a sample from a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, putting in a dish and keeping it
alive, usually we target like 28 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: for that, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives you an idea where the,
sorry, I'm talking about Celsius here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so your audience knows, because I
know you Americans like to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not very good at converting it,
but yeah, I'm always talking in Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a hotter environment, they can take
more nutrients is what I've found.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is you need to kind of
balance that with more water as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, well, you just dilute your
nutrient back to what it was, but just
[SPEAKER_00]: giving it overall more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like there's that balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will take more nutrients out
than others, as you know, like some
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that, so you're trying to
get this plant to be more tolerant to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dial back the nutrients a little bit
and you allow the growth rate to slow and
[SPEAKER_00]: you precondition it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're basically, you've got a high
medicinal compound producing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not particularly, you know,
good in 19 degrees Celsius, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: for production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you do is you grow it in normal
conditions, say 25 to 30 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize to your viewers again for not
using Fahrenheit, but maybe you can put a
[SPEAKER_00]: little overdub on this afterwards,
Chris, to correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to do is grow it at the
desired temperature at a reduced nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you move it across,
for example, to a lower temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get away with, you basically what
happens is all the growth will slow down a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, but the plant will be able to
withstand that and still finish to a
[SPEAKER_00]: decent level in that colder environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lot of one of those dials
that, again, doesn't get spoke about that
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because everybody, again, it's
counterintuitive, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, you want more out of the
plant to give it more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you actually want to slow the
plant down a little bit because if it
[SPEAKER_00]: grows too fast, it can't respond to the
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it has to sit in the stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, right now I'm comfortable and now I
can finish growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to be doing that during
production, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to precondition that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously when I'm talking about
taking plants and moving them,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about conditioning mothers and
then taking clones from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can obviously do it with the
vegetating clones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically precondition, you can
actually do it with seeds as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Setting seed on certain conditions will
give you certain traits in that condition
[SPEAKER_00]: when the seeds sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about just that, I guess the
overarching theme that keeps coming around
[SPEAKER_00]: here is just this idea of pushing the
plant's ability to adapt, but giving it
[SPEAKER_00]: time to do it, making sure it knows what's
coming before it comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll have a much wider room for
error for when you want to do this new
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for example, in the example I just
gave, getting it to grow well at 19
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Celsius, you want to give as much
readiness for that as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen so many people fail by taking
clones that are grown indoor only in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada or outdoor in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they come into a glass house in
Europe and they wonder why it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: perform to the same degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that clone has not been in any way
conditioned, maybe been hardened,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not quite the same as what
we're talking about here when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually steering the crop towards
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's kind of like just changing
the traits, changing the expression of
[SPEAKER_00]: those genes, but always limited by what
those genes can do at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much good information, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually the first episode that we
have on dedicated crop steering on this
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we've touched upon it a little
bit here and there in episodes,
[SPEAKER_02]: but nothing this detailed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so glad to have you on here today
because you have so much experience in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate you coming onto the
podcast today.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I still would like to write some
articles for Seedsman.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can always find me through the
Seedsman blog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to do a couple articles a month at
least, or a bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an Instagram account called the
Godstar Paradox.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a little bit of ambient metal,
a little bit of electronic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go check me out on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some stuff on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to not do much in the way of
growing and things like that on there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I sometimes interact with people on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best way to do me is the Godstar
Paradox on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a Gary Yates YouTube channel as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably through the Jorge Cervantes
network as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's usually got links to my stuff on his
site as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll definitely have a link to Dr.
Yates down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_02]: section below so you can easily navigate
to him and give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to the Patreon folks,
those of them supporting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep the lights on here in the studio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much for your
contributions there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put on the screen right now,
