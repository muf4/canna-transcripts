[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 159.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm going to interview
Colin Bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a scientist who studies soil microbes
and plant microbial interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: He completed his PhD in soil microbial
ecology in 2009 and is well known as the
[SPEAKER_00]: inventor of mammoth pea, a popular
microbial inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He currently works for microbial mass,
a micro product that helps promote plant
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor and increase biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode, we focus on microbes,
of course, everything from the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes, how they function, how they can
be applied in the garden and more.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back and I'm joined with Colin
Bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming onto the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually ran into you at MJBizCon and
kind of put you on the spot a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a live stream going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, there's Colin Bell over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we talk to him?
[SPEAKER_00]: Came over to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were nice enough to be on the live
stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: He answered a couple of questions and I
invited you onto the podcast and you
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So put you on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest with you, you have been on my
list of potential guests for years and I
[SPEAKER_00]: finally have been able to get you on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really excited for this talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk all about microbes,
which is your specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get too deep into it,
can you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it was a pleasure running into you
and a lot of fun being on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been following it for years since
2020 and so it's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, people that don't know me,
my background professionally is a
[SPEAKER_02]: scientist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a PhD in microbiology and I've
always been fascinated with nature and
[SPEAKER_02]: natural processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point as a young adult,
I wanted to have more purpose as I engaged
[SPEAKER_02]: in nature and did the hikes and all the
things I love to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That drew me into the biological sciences
and ecology and then went on this pathway
[SPEAKER_02]: to become a soil microbial ecologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, going through a master's and
then getting my PhD in that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a heck of a journey and that's
led to a lot of really fruitful
[SPEAKER_02]: professional experiences also.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think why I love soil so much is because
as a very early age, my parents,
[SPEAKER_02]: we grew up in West Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were from North, but then they were
both academics and they both landed jobs
[SPEAKER_02]: at Texas Tech University in Lubbock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Texas is where I grew up and they were
fanatic, if not obsessive and compulsive
[SPEAKER_02]: around gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: They spent all their free time changing
every bit of yard into a different garden
[SPEAKER_02]: bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had me in the yard with my little
shovel and my shovels got bigger as I
[SPEAKER_02]: grew, digging holes, helping to cultivate
the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe that soil and working in the
soil and growing plants is honestly
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I just grew up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in my DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't help myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I move somewhere and I've moved
several times across my life, I've always
[SPEAKER_02]: started with the property and transformed
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost a form of art for me,
creating perennial beds and garden beds
[SPEAKER_02]: and flowering beds and annuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: My kids think I'm very obsessive in
gardening and working.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spend all my free time working in the
yard here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll blame my parents, but it's just a
part of who I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a lot of enjoyment out of gardening
and just working in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just leave it at understanding at a
deeper level from all my academic training
[SPEAKER_02]: processes and soil processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make it that much more, I think,
intellectually stimulating for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think about, and my mind's going
the whole time, and I'll just go into this
[SPEAKER_02]: huge intellectual or mental rabbit hole,
so to speak, and just have these fun
[SPEAKER_02]: daydreaming experiences while I'm doing
physical activity in the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know one of the things you're most known
for is you are the inventor of mammoth
[SPEAKER_00]: pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to imagine that there are a lot of
people in the audience right now tuning in
[SPEAKER_00]: that use mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the inventor of mammoth pee,
and then you switched over and now you're
[SPEAKER_00]: at microbial mass, is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's exactly correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: That journey quickly, working at Colorado
State University after I graduated,
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a lot of professional gigs at the
United States Forest Service and the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States Department of Agriculture,
Agriculture Research Services.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was between West Texas and here in
Colorado, where I live now in Fort
[SPEAKER_02]: Collins, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, I plugged into my dream
location professionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was the Natural Resource Ecology Lab
at Colorado State University.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were such a driven group.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very, very stimulating.
[SPEAKER_02]: All my academic heroes were housed at the
NREL Natural Resource Ecology Lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: After about four and a half years at that
facility, some of my peers and colleagues,
[SPEAKER_02]: we wanted to make a difference quicker
than just the scientific process of
[SPEAKER_02]: writing papers and getting grant and going
down that academic setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started thinking about and challenging
how we could be more applied so we could
[SPEAKER_02]: get solutions for farmers now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of that someday someone will
transform our science into application
[SPEAKER_02]: approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: We realized we had to take it upon
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started developing microbial natural
solutions that were solving real world
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture challenges that we had
identified.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the journey of creating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, it's known as Mammoth Pea.
[SPEAKER_02]: What started the track of developing the
company Mammoth, which was a great
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about an eight-year run for me
before I did leave, as you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: in late 2022, just to start bridging out
and working with other teams and other
[SPEAKER_02]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: This venture with MIM Horticulture and the
Microbial Mass Group has been really
[SPEAKER_02]: rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when Mammoth Pea hit the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've refreshed my memory on what year it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was 2017 or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I left the university in March 16,
2015 to start the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a little bit of money, no
resources, no facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Started in a one-car garage and just
started developing a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bio-fermentation facility, literally a
little one-car garage in a rental flat me
[SPEAKER_02]: and my buddy had.
[SPEAKER_02]: That quickly scaled through the last half
of 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my first customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing was I left the university as the
co-founder, the operational co-founder to
[SPEAKER_02]: start the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero team members, just me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My call to action was I had to scale up
technology, build out a team,
[SPEAKER_02]: commercialize, go to market, and start
making revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had about six months to do that before
we ran out of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of quick moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, I remember having my first
sale in Denver and we were here so we were
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting the Denver market pretty hard in
August 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first $100 bill and I thought,
wow, as an entrepreneur that had an idea
[SPEAKER_02]: and we converted this idea into an actual
living product that people could use in
[SPEAKER_02]: their gardens was a fascinating journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a game changer in a lot of
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbial inoculants in general can be
very, very beneficial in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we continue on here talking about
microbes, I want to warn you that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: a wide audience here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have beginners, intermediate,
and advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these questions are going to be
really for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start with the basics,
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you start by explaining what
beneficial microorganisms are and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: function in the garden ecosystem?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would say is in general,
most microbes, especially the beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes, that help plants grow,
when we think about beneficial,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's actually beneficial microbes for
humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call them probiotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really nice, familiar way to
start thinking about beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: For plants, most of them live in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have exchanged value and helped
support plant growth since they've
[SPEAKER_02]: existed, since the very beginning of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do that by assisting plants in
several different ways, by engaging with
[SPEAKER_02]: them, living in that habitat of their
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can help stimulate some levels of
chemical signaling, which allows plants to
[SPEAKER_02]: elongate their roots so they're able to
take up more water, more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: What microbes are very well known for in
natural settings and in farming settings
[SPEAKER_02]: alike is nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrients can get bound up in substrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can substrate in soil and become hard
for plants to take them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, microbes do a great job of exuding
enzymes and other chemistry that helps
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to create bioavailable nutrients,
which plants need to support their growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know all the macro and micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we're not that familiar with it,
but basically, just like humans,
[SPEAKER_02]: plants need certain vitamins and minerals
and elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all made of carbon and nitrogen and
all these specific elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them are listed on the elemental
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a select group of macro and
micronutrients that plants need.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only one that they really get from the
air is carbon and everything else they get
[SPEAKER_02]: from the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are very hard to extract from
a plant perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants do a good job of drying up,
but they can be nutrients can be bound and
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to liberate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where microbes play a critical role
in natural ecosystems, cycling nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: and allowing plants to continue to take
them up so they can grow and be successful
[SPEAKER_02]: in natural settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of beneficial microbes should
gardeners be aware of and what roles do
[SPEAKER_00]: those play in supporting plant health?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a wide range of microbial
applications that gardeners utilize,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether you know it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing in soil, there's
microbes in that soil and the plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: taking advantage of that in a natural
setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no plant that exists in nature or
anything in soil that doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial association.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of home gardeners and even
professional gardeners alike like to
[SPEAKER_02]: engage in composting activity where
there's a lot of material and green waste
[SPEAKER_02]: that can get decomposed over time and then
ultimately applied to systems where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient rich and microbial rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are what I would call some very
general applications where there's a wide
[SPEAKER_02]: range of undefined general microbes that
we know are going to support plant growth
[SPEAKER_02]: and liberate nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other groups of microbes that are
more of that precision application that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can actually purchase and do research
and they're manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a huge agriculture industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bio-stimulant industry where
different companies manufacture or ferment
[SPEAKER_02]: or create different microbial formulas to
perform specific functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these formulas might engage the
plant to stimulate rooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others might engage the plant to stimulate
different nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some microbes are actually applied just to
perform a pesticide function where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to alleviate plants from certain
pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm familiar with from a
manufacturing and scientific point of view
[SPEAKER_02]: is developing microbial systems that
actually liberate specific elements like
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus and calcium and iron which are
selected because they're a little stickier
[SPEAKER_02]: chemically which I mean they're harder for
plants to maximize the uptake of those
[SPEAKER_02]: specific elements in natural systems in
particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the motivation behind the science
that the team I was associated with at
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado State University was targeting to
solve that ecological problem,
[SPEAKER_02]: the phosphorus problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a phosphorus problem in
agriculture and there's still companies
[SPEAKER_02]: looking to solve that particular problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard a crazy stat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget where I heard it and I don't even
know if it's true or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to tell me if it's true or
not but I heard that 99.9% of microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't even been identified yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they say.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't identified them,
you can't tell for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that exact number is, there's at
least 10X to 99X microbes that are very
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to identify.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you a pretty fun story thinking
about that and my journey manufacturing a
[SPEAKER_02]: product, Mammoth Pea.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we wanted to do was collect all the
microbial diversity we could from nature
[SPEAKER_02]: and so we collected soils in desert
systems and overseas and in agriculture
[SPEAKER_02]: systems and forested systems and we grew
up all the microbes we possibly could.
[SPEAKER_02]: The environment selects and for
microorganisms, the environment to a large
[SPEAKER_02]: degree, it could be abiotic meaning a
temperature or a moisture or maybe a
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical pH type of environment which is
hoping to select their success meaning
[SPEAKER_02]: will they persist and grow well or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to a large degree, the foods source is
a huge selective criteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could take the same soil samples and
have two very different food sources and
[SPEAKER_02]: actually nurture and grow very different
microbial communities and community
[SPEAKER_02]: assemblages based on that food source
which is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only is the food source but the time
of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think about growing microbes and the
microbes I work with will grow in a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be fully mature and have an
exponential growth curve going in just a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some microbes take weeks to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some microbes take months to grow and so
the persistence, the time is a factor that
[SPEAKER_02]: really predicates the complications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only the diverse food sources but the
temporal or time that it takes to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: nurture some of these microbes are all
reasons why it's very hard to extract most
[SPEAKER_02]: of the microbes from nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about food sources, it reminds me
of folks that use molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I used to use a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people use it every single week
they're adding in molasses and what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard is that if you continue to use that
as a food source, you'll have some
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes that feed off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others not all feed off of it and you
could be throwing off the balance of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil food web if you just continue to add
molasses in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true or is that just bro science?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that's my exact perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just from my knowledge around
select food sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have microbial media books and they're
about that thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these different formulas with
different carbon substrates and these
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of chemical agents select
for specific microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know for a fact there's a specificity
that different media and sugars nurture in
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial communities and there is a lot
of great papers that are published in the
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific literature that shows exactly
what you just shared where if you feed
[SPEAKER_02]: molasses and it wasn't even for that long
term of a study, it will allow the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes that grow and can eat or consume
molasses very well to grow very well and
[SPEAKER_02]: the others that don't grow so well or
can't utilize that substrate, that sugar
[SPEAKER_02]: so quickly, they won't grow as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you find, and this is a way that
I think about it, life and especially
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial life is a probability game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once you get to a certain threshold
or mass as a species, you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: competitive advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're actually taking up space and
occupying that space which means you're
[SPEAKER_02]: occupying the supply, food supply in that
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if a food source can bias microbial
growth to certain species, then it's also
[SPEAKER_02]: going to predicate the community
structure, just like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you say that molasses should not
be used in the garden at all or are you
[SPEAKER_00]: for it just once in a while?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to tell people what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: People use molasses, they have success,
and so that's not the position I would
[SPEAKER_02]: take.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would say is, and I say this
consistently, plants feed microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called exudation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so from the beginning of time,
and molasses is a sugar and a sugar is a
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon, chains of carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the plant gets carbon, a CO2 from
the air, it cleaves off the oxygen and
[SPEAKER_02]: continues to consume that carbon and it
creates chains of carbons and ultimately
[SPEAKER_02]: we're all made of carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're mostly, organic means that carbon
backbone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're mostly carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same for plants, same for microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What plants have evolved to do from a long
time ago and the ones that have persisted
[SPEAKER_02]: and succeeded, it succeeded in biology
means able to pass their genome to
[SPEAKER_02]: subsequent generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's success.
[SPEAKER_02]: Creating a seed and having that seed
probably propagate or vegetate,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's success in biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: The successful plants that have evolved
over time learned that if they consume
[SPEAKER_02]: that CO2 and transform some of that into
simple sugars and exude that in the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's all sorts of varieties of
exudate, the microbes will feed on that
[SPEAKER_02]: exudate, they'll grow to these masses and
they'll cycle the nutrients and there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship and an exchange of carbon for
different nutrient cycling and soil
[SPEAKER_02]: functions that the plants actually
engineer through rhizosphere priming or
[SPEAKER_02]: through exudation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the priming or that exudation isn't
specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes over time and that chemistry
can change by species, that chemistry can
[SPEAKER_02]: change by plant needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in some ways I feel like the plant
are actually directing the traffic below
[SPEAKER_02]: ground and they can exude different
chemical species and different types of
[SPEAKER_02]: sugars over time and slight varieties
including some amino acids that they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: trickle in there as well to nurture the
community, the microbes feed them that
[SPEAKER_02]: support them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a very interesting way to
think about feeding microbes is why do we
[SPEAKER_02]: think we know what's best?
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant knows better and the plant's
gonna do it naturally and so I like to
[SPEAKER_02]: leave that function to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is incredible to know just a
small piece of what goes on into the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: in that ecosystem and how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it can be mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna get deeper into bacteria and this
is where I kind of ask you a broad
[SPEAKER_00]: question and we'll see which way you run
with it is what are some important species
[SPEAKER_00]: of bacteria that we should be aware of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well listen, I'll be very general and I'm
not as biased about species as maybe some
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason is because I've looked at
tens of thousands of species and
[SPEAKER_02]: characterized them physically,
meaning not only physically but
[SPEAKER_02]: functionally, physiologically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can look at let's just say a
thousand different bacteria that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: collect from soil and there's a bunch of
different groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we know there's family, then there's
genre, then there's species, microbes have
[SPEAKER_02]: functional redundancies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a really important
characteristic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbes don't have a specific function.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're biology just like every other
biological organism and whatever they do
[SPEAKER_02]: is gonna overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we talk about cycling nitrogen or
phosphorus or you know chelating or
[SPEAKER_02]: exuding some chemistry that's gonna
initiate root growth, most microbes have
[SPEAKER_02]: some competency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've shown it and we've collected data
where if you look at a wide range,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say a thousand microbes,
they all have some level of competency but
[SPEAKER_02]: some do it better than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thinking about that functionally is
interesting and that's why you think that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a wide range of microbes in soil
that pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Persist and support plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting point is the resistance
and resilience of those particular groups,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning if a lot of different groups do
the same thing, which ones are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: going to live and do things well?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I used to do a lot of work in
desert systems and what we saw was a ton
[SPEAKER_02]: of functional redundancy, meaning a lot of
the microbes did the same thing but what
[SPEAKER_02]: they had was very different environmental
tolerances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning some microbes did very good in
high rain events while others didn't do
[SPEAKER_02]: great in those events and most microbes in
biology like water but they did great in
[SPEAKER_02]: dry hot events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you wanted that diversity because
you needed soil function across that wide
[SPEAKER_02]: range of environmental variability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you'll find in most, let's just
say products, bottled microbes that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can access commercially, you'll find
bacillus genus and there's a whole array
[SPEAKER_02]: of different bacillus species.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason you find them in agriculture is
because of their resistance and resilience
[SPEAKER_02]: in environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacillus species are dormant species.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually create things called
endospores, which is the dormant state of
[SPEAKER_02]: their vegetative cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning they can go in this dormant state.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think about plants, a seed is a
dormant state of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think about fungi, spores are
what's called, it's like a seed but a
[SPEAKER_02]: dormant stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well bacillus are one of the only
microbial bacteria genres that produce
[SPEAKER_02]: that type of dormant state and it's called
an endospore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason you find mostly bacillus
species is not necessarily because of
[SPEAKER_02]: their function because there's a pretty
good overlap of function between these
[SPEAKER_02]: bacillus species but they're very
resilient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning that they can persist for a very
long time especially in dry environments
[SPEAKER_02]: in a dry carrier they can persist for
years and years in soil in very harsh
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions and then when the environment's
right they'll vegetate which means
[SPEAKER_02]: activate and do what they do to help
support plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say by far the majority of
bacterial species you're gonna find in any
[SPEAKER_02]: type of agriculture or gardening
application is gonna be different bacillus
[SPEAKER_02]: genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with a handful of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know bacillus subtilis is kind of the
most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all over our skin apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the most common one on our skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well listen, bacillus subtilis too,
it doesn't do just one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even this product microbial mass by MIM
Horticulture has many bacillus species in
[SPEAKER_02]: there and the scientists that developed
that particular technology made sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: they could identify some functions of
these different species that they did very
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But bacillus subtilis does many functions
very well which is interesting and because
[SPEAKER_02]: they can be dormant for long periods of
time they can be applied into the market
[SPEAKER_02]: into agriculture settings without dying
and that's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have the best and I think that's
the difference between academic
[SPEAKER_02]: fundamental science and applied science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Academics get caught up and I'm not
speaking derogatorily I was an academic
[SPEAKER_02]: but I got caught up on looking at
something that was super cool and I
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely fell in love with it on the lab
bench.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it doesn't have the other
applications and features of persistence
[SPEAKER_02]: and able to be compatible in different
environments for different applications it
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes very tricky to use that type of
organism outside of just enjoying its
[SPEAKER_02]: coolness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned dormant and I just want
to kind of get a little bit deeper into
[SPEAKER_00]: dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my understanding microbes can go
dormant and they can get out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you let the medium dry out
too much then my understanding that the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes go dormant but when you
re-moisturize that medium they wake up and
[SPEAKER_00]: dormancy for those that aren't familiar
with it in layman's terms of say a sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: state, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that all true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do any of the microbes kind of die off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to drought?
[SPEAKER_02]: They will and so again it's a probability
game.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's never and always in biology and
there's never and never and so there's
[SPEAKER_02]: always a range of what happens and so you
know let's talk about the two contrasting
[SPEAKER_02]: groups of microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked with microbes and in the IP the
patent that I developed for mammoth pee
[SPEAKER_02]: they were not dormant bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were rod shaped, not able to form
endospores but they were very robust and
[SPEAKER_02]: they had a really interesting membrane
which allowed them to just hold their
[SPEAKER_02]: shape even in very dry conditions and very
salty high ion conditions and high osmotic
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, these microbes came from soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not used to being in a fertilizer
tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had to select the ones that did
do a good job and it turns out that these
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes in that particular product were
able just to maintain their structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if they weren't functioning very well
and they're just holding on once the
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions became favorable and they got
inoculated or they collided with the root
[SPEAKER_02]: zone, that's their habitat, that's home
and they could start really functioning
[SPEAKER_02]: and rocking with what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bacillus in particular have evolved to
immediately flip from an active state to
[SPEAKER_02]: an endospore state or a dormant seed state
like hibernating but it really transforms
[SPEAKER_02]: the structure and I guess the lesson that
it's basically a law but what it is is
[SPEAKER_02]: structure equals function.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens in some cases with high
osmotic pressure, a lot of water or
[SPEAKER_02]: extreme drought conditions is it changes
the water availability or the ability of
[SPEAKER_02]: the microbes to regulate their osmotic
pressure within the cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they can't regulate in a very dry
environment, hold on to their water or in
[SPEAKER_02]: a very wet environment where they have to
continue to exude water because they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: take in too much water ultimately and
they're cells so think about a little
[SPEAKER_02]: circle or think about a balloon but
macroscopic so you couldn't see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about a water balloon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It holds its structure until it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have one little pinprick,
what happens?
[SPEAKER_02]: The insides squirt out and that water
balloon no longer holds water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that's what happens with microbes
across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can't figure out how to maintain
that structure, to live to fight another
[SPEAKER_02]: day, they're going to turn, they're going
to exude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called lysing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their cells will lyse and their insides
will just release into their environment
[SPEAKER_02]: which becomes a food source.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a little vitamin pack so it's
not necessarily a bad thing but so some
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes will lyse during these extreme
conditions depending especially how quick
[SPEAKER_02]: the shift is from dry to wet to dry and
others can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can maintain that environment
relatively well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That also happens with pH shifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's more hydrogen ions or acids
versus OH ions, well microbes at the
[SPEAKER_02]: cellular level have to regulate that so
they have these pumps literally built in
[SPEAKER_02]: to their membrane, to their skins and it
pumps out to balance the outside with the
[SPEAKER_02]: inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what microbes are always doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out that a lot of the
microbes that are very environmentally
[SPEAKER_02]: robust are better at pumping.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're better at regulating that osmotic
pressure, that ion concentrations from
[SPEAKER_02]: their interior to their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about like powdered versus liquid
form on these microbial inoculants?
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of reminds me of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to imagine that some of these
powdered forms of microbes, they just have
[SPEAKER_00]: those microbes in there that can last in a
dry form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about the differences
between liquid and powder microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is the exact difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's many different carriers of a
powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just talk about that for one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every one of them are going to be microbes
that can form a dormant endospore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be very hard for you to
find any dry powder microbial solution
[SPEAKER_02]: that isn't a bacillus or a different
arrangement of bacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of those are not active in that
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all in that endospore form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they can stay there for a very long
time, which makes it effective for the
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once those microbes are introduced into an
environment that they sense a food source,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll vegetate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what it calls between a dormant state
and a vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll activate and start doing what they
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're sitting there in a seed form
and all it is is protein, just like a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: with some DNA and a little bit of sugar
carbon that when they can sense the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, they start regulating the
DNA, creating the proteins they need to
[SPEAKER_02]: and turning into a completely different
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was always curious about liquid
versus powder and kind of the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: there because I know some manufacturers
can't offer a powder, although there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some benefits shipping-wise and stuff like
that, having a powder versus liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was just curious on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell you, with the mammoth pea
product, I wanted to have a powder so bad,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the microbes in mammoth pea,
I could never find a carrier that I could
[SPEAKER_02]: get them to persist well in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I could never get recovery when
trying to impregnate different dry powder
[SPEAKER_02]: solutions with the mammoth pea microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we only had a liquid offering.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are bacillus endospore-related
bacterial products that all of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: dry, and some of them are actually also
offered in liquid form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it really depends on the microbe
and how much elasticity you have with that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most interesting, in my
opinion, bacteria out there are
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how microbes that can actually take
nitrogen from the air, convert it and put
[SPEAKER_00]: it into the medium form that the plant can
then uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about microbes that fix
nitrogen from there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a really specialized group
that have done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's so cool about these.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's science, but once you start getting
into it, you're like, it might as well be
[SPEAKER_02]: science fiction because it sounds like a
science fiction book, the way they do
[SPEAKER_02]: these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's microbes that can persist in
very high salt contents or very hot
[SPEAKER_02]: environments or very, very sulfury
environments and all these different
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental gradients.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not as many groups as just the
general groups that persist within a range
[SPEAKER_02]: of temperatures and relatively normal
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the azobacteria group, they're
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they can do is they're not
necessarily always fixing nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're able to do that and pull
nitrogen which is a major element from the
[SPEAKER_02]: air.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how many people realize that,
but we're breathing in nitrogen all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time as far as N gas borne, which is,
it sounds counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: These microbes have evolved to take
advantage of that where they weren't very
[SPEAKER_02]: able in certain conditions to persist
because of low oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they create these different rhizomes
where they can embed inside these plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and it creates a habitat that they're very
comfortable in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an evolutionary strategy that allowed
these particular groups for whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: reason to succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a successful strategy because
they're still around today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they're able to do is in that
very, very low oxygen environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: pull in nitrogen and use that as an
electronic scepter for respiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the mechanism they're trying
to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbes breathe just like we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to take in oxygen and they take
out CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: But microbes have evolved to be able to
adapt that strategy to very, very low
[SPEAKER_02]: oxygen concentrations or dissolved oxygen
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in some cases, there's groups of
anaerobic, which is no oxygen environment
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when there's no oxygen and it's
anaerobic, you can't take in oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's none to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can't facilitate respiration
and that electron transport chain to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they've adapted these strategies to
pull other elements that they're able to
[SPEAKER_02]: pull to facilitate respiration in those
particular environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an amazing group of microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find them in agriculture quite
readily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they do is they associate,
especially in rhizome related conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're able to help feed the plants
nitrogen from air, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's helpful instead of having an
input to get nitrogen in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be granite fertilizer or
synthetic nutrients, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: adding some beneficial microbes in there
that can actually grab it from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it is Azos bacteria that's in a
lot of microbial inoculants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you, that's a strategy for a
lot of crop rotations.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk about farming rotations where
you're trying to keep plants in the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: year round.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll have a cash crop and you'll have
what's called a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes farmers will plant different
crops that actually promote nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: fixing bacteria in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it replenishes the soil in the off
season with nitrogen from growing that
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super cool strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, another type of bacteria that I
feel like it's being talked about more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very interesting as well as
endophytic bacteria, endophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about endophytic
bacteria?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll tell you what they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a lot of nasancy to
understand exactly where they play.
[SPEAKER_02]: But endophytic bacteria, and there's fungi
that do this also, are bacteria that
[SPEAKER_02]: actually incorporate inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they'll work within between the
cells of the plant cells and work their
[SPEAKER_02]: way and grow within the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's there's always an exchange is
what I'd say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard more and more groups trying to
develop endophytic bacteria for either,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, from a nitrogen fixing point of
view, or maybe some other poor views.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's always a trade off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if they're growing, if microbes are
growing in the plant, the plant's giving
[SPEAKER_02]: it something.
[SPEAKER_02]: To to incentivize it for something in
return.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say another even a more intuitive
example, because, you know, I might the
[SPEAKER_02]: jury's still out on on exactly how
beneficial endophytic bacteria are in
[SPEAKER_02]: application.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's a lot of great
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a little on the nascent side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard it ebb and flow for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that there's really fun
applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understand where there's a compelling
product that I've seen a clear mode of
[SPEAKER_02]: action for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will tell you something that that's
been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's in the fungal category.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our busculum microrisal fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I know you know about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone knows about AM fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's the same concept where these
fungi actually infect and grow inside the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant root.
[SPEAKER_02]: They live part of them live inside the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way they could be
successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's an exchange for these
microrisal or busculum microrisal fungi
[SPEAKER_02]: where they'll create these sites of
exchange within the plant root.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant has to give up something and it
gives up carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant's always giving up carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant's always giving up sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a charismatic carbon pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can look like anything it wants to look
like depending on the species.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's drawing in carbon and it's
transforming some of that into sugars to
[SPEAKER_02]: feed the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to feed the microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our busculum microrisal fungi in
particular called AM fungi or other things
[SPEAKER_02]: are actually scavengers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually have part of their bodies
filamentous hair-like structures that
[SPEAKER_02]: exude into the soil past the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can scavenge available nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they do a great job of is
scavenging phosphate phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're able to draw that
phosphorus from beyond the root growth
[SPEAKER_02]: zone and bring it back to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these are buscular sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: They exchange phosphate to the plant for
carbon from the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so although it's not endophytic
bacteria, that's an endophytic
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a clear symbiotic relationship that I
think emulates a very, very clear mode of
[SPEAKER_02]: action with that same type of concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see these microrisal fungi
products that market unlocking phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that really what they're doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just an extension of the root zone?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how they're accessing that
phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a little bit of a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buscular microrisal fungi to unlock
phosphorus, typically you're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: a balanced source of phosphorus and you're
transforming that from a plant unavailable
[SPEAKER_02]: form to a plant available form.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would call unlocking
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's not get into semantics here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would say is our buscular
microrisae are not very enzymatically
[SPEAKER_02]: capable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not doing a lot of the
unlocking.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're more like scavengers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kind of like the hyena of the
particular fungal kingdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're able to infect the plant root.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a transfer location within that
plant root within the cortical cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: They develop these vesicle or buscular
sites and then they extend out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest with you, bacteria are
much more enzymatically capable to
[SPEAKER_02]: liberate phosphorus in these
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the fungi can grow and they
cohabitate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's tens of thousands of bacterial and
different fungi within very, very small,
[SPEAKER_02]: even grams of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these fungi can go and as they
sense phosphate that's in bioavailable or
[SPEAKER_02]: soluble form, they can suck it up very
competently and then they translocate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They keep some of it for themselves and
they translocate quite a bit of it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant because they like that sugar the
plant feeds them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're scavenging phosphorus and you
can consider that unlocking phosphorus or
[SPEAKER_02]: grabbing it from the soil the plant didn't
have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are through that sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's something that's a little bit
of a misconception.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not necessarily liberating.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're capturing something that's already
been liberated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll say something else about
phosphorus or mycorrhizae that's a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of a misconception.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a great study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go look at some of these papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can probably provide some in the links
or it's publicly available information.
[SPEAKER_02]: The higher the phosphorus availability for
plant, the lower the infection success
[SPEAKER_02]: rate is for mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if phosphorus is available,
the plants don't let them in as easy is
[SPEAKER_02]: what that comes down to, which I think it
really speaks to the environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitivity of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant doesn't have to give up that
carbon if it doesn't want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's getting what it needs from
that particular microbial function,
[SPEAKER_02]: it won't let them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the infection rate of mycorrhizal
fungi in a high phosphorus environment is
[SPEAKER_02]: much lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much less than the infection rate of
mycorrhizal fungi to a plant in a very low
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus environment where the plant
actually needs that symbiotic
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought with unlocking phosphorus that
it was actually like the fungi was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of nutrient cycling and then
turning it from an unavailable form to an
[SPEAKER_00]: available form.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just an extension of it and just
kind of grabbing it where the roots really
[SPEAKER_00]: can't grab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, there's other microbial fungal
groups and obviously bacteria that do a
[SPEAKER_02]: great job of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why, you know, they coexist,
but they wouldn't be as competent if they
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have the other microbial
contributions within that soil environment
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to scavenge that phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endomycorrhizae and then ectomycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of want to get into that a little
bit because I feel like a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: audience doesn't really know the
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we often hear that one of those
isn't actually usable by medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about the differences
between endo and ecto?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So endo is related to the albusculum
mycorrhizae group that we just talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's many different species of
endomycorrhizal fungi, and there's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of specificity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's, if you talk about the
genus species, just getting scientific,
[SPEAKER_02]: just to put a name to it, it used to be
called Glomus intradices.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also see it as rhizophagus
intradices.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mycologists or scientists that study fungi
love to change names for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are certain species of fungi
that do pretty good with medicinal plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's only a couple that are
actually very relevant to my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are other arbuscular mycorrhizal
species that do a very good job of
[SPEAKER_02]: interacting with other different plant
species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of plant specificity.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the endo or arbuscular mycorrhizal
fungal group, the ecto the same way,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're more associated with a
woodier, shrubbier type of plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ecto mycorrhizal fungi don't
penetrate, but they grow like a net or a
[SPEAKER_02]: sheath around the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called a heartic net for whatever
reason, because the scientists actually
[SPEAKER_02]: that first discovered this, I think it
was, I forget his first name, but it was
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Heartic, if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be completely misremembering that,
but I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is old school stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just literally a layer of fungal
mat that grows around and covers the
[SPEAKER_02]: outside perimeter of roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's ecto.
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates a lot of benefits also.
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates a very, very highly functional
and enzymatically capable area right
[SPEAKER_02]: around the root zone to maximize nutrient
uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so endo mycorrhizae or endo
mycorrhizal fungi are a very different
[SPEAKER_02]: group of fungi than ecto mycorrhizal
fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ecto mycorrhizal fungi are typically very
highly functional, very enzymatically
[SPEAKER_02]: capable, and will do a good job of carbon
and nutrient cycling to a lesser degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: These ecto mycorrhizal saprophytic fungi,
pre-living fungi that actually also
[SPEAKER_02]: produce a lot of these ecto mycorrhizal
associations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bacteria and the mineralizers,
these bacteria as mineralizers also
[SPEAKER_02]: interact with this ecto mycorrhizal layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates this crazy habitat,
a hotbed of nutrient cycling or nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: availability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a true benefit to plant growth
in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ecto mycorrhizae can be beneficial to
plants like hemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not my understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't associate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do associate with different shrubby
types of plants and some trees and in some
[SPEAKER_02]: cases, some grasses, but it's a very
different group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know any ecto mycorrhizal
associations, not that different medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: or hemp plants can't benefit from free
living fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they are very enzymatically
capable and they'll stimulate some
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient cycling, but they won't form that
true structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to get clarification on that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colony forming units, CFU.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when somebody picks up a bottle of
microbial inoculant, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll look at the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: CFU is one of the things that are
mentioned on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break it down?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is CFU?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's not going to be a clear
cut answer to this, but what's an
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate amount for bacteria,
fungi, so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just go CFU is just a measure of
density.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so why it's a colony forming unit,
a colony is a visible metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so bacteria and fungi on the very
early stage growth scale are invisible.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Micro means naked or not visible to the
naked eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs magnification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you think about a bacterial cell
where you could never see it with the
[SPEAKER_02]: naked eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: A colony forming unit is when enough of
these cells have reproduced, then bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: are reproduced clonally.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow to a certain size, then they get
too big to be efficient because the cell
[SPEAKER_02]: membrane is not at the right ratio for
their internal components.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they bud and they reproduce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they'll continue to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll clonally reproduce and they
can do it very quickly at a certain stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once they've done that enough,
a certain species where you can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: visibly see, quite honestly, it looks like
a little blob on a Petri dish,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's called a colony forming unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason that's relevant is because
that's the measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be impossible to count the
cellular, the amount of cells within,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's just say there's a thousand colony
forming units.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there could be a billion cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: That make up that thousand colony forming
units.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just a measure that allows us
to quantify at some level, some density of
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes within a particular solution on a
plate, whatever you might think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question that relates to hydrogen
peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can microbial knockouts be used with
oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_00]: or hypochlorous acid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it kill off those microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a big concern for a lot of
gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are using hydrogen peroxide to in
order to kind of sterilize things and
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent fungal with pathogens,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also want to use the microbial
knockouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also want the benefits from microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they be used together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, short answer, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that because I've worked with
them for long enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll qualify, you know,
as a PhD microbiologist, I have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: really good at two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is understanding how to grow and
propagate microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other is to be excellent at
killing them because they have to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: sterile, constant sterile, sterile
environments and grow the microbes they
[SPEAKER_02]: want and not grow the other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really, really familiar with
disinfectants is what we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: these disinfecting agents.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's antiseptics,
which we use on our living skin,
[SPEAKER_02]: like alcohol, as an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hydrogen peroxide is actually
considered antiseptic to a large degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also used as a disinfectant in
cultivation practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Disinfectants are typically the bleach,
hypochlorous acid, parasitic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: H2O2 is an example of something that's
been used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in general, to kill microbes,
you need two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, you need an agent,
a disinfecting agent that can either
[SPEAKER_02]: create a static or a cidal property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Static means freezing growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cidal means killing growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those are the two properties that
qualify as an appropriate disinfectant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a concentration and a time
required on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've tested a ton of disinfectants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to kill microbes just to see what
it would take to kill them based on
[SPEAKER_02]: recommended applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are very, very few agents or
disinfectant agents in cultivation that
[SPEAKER_02]: are recommended for the appropriate time
and concentration to effectively kill many
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because it's not concentrated
enough and the time is too ephemeral.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't allow them to sit in that
solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would recommend that it's,
don't change a thing if you're having good
[SPEAKER_02]: success.
[SPEAKER_02]: Far be it from me to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: But make sure that you could integrate
with confidence the biology you want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say it's better practice to
stagger a disinfectant application from a
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial just intuitively.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I wouldn't want to mix bleach with
my microbes and say, okay, have at it,
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bleach agent or a hypochlorous acid or
any type of chlorine, H2O2, is more so to
[SPEAKER_02]: mitigate risk, to maintain a level of
cleanliness through the lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: through anything that might represent a
risk over time if it grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once microbes hit the rhizosphere zone,
that habitat is so complex that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: buffered from much of that anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you think about roots,
and I don't know if anyone on the call or
[SPEAKER_02]: you have ever seen roots at the
microscopic level, it's nice to see
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy roots just at the macro level and
they're just white structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, oh man, that's pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at it under a microscope,
it looks like the candy lands of Utah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a surface area that's engineered
naturally that ebbs and flows and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: just nothing but microscopic roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no microscopic canyons that the
microbes embed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the surface area is inherent for
maximum absorption and that's what roots
[SPEAKER_02]: function are.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more surface area, the more it can
absorb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So microscopically, these things are going
every which way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's so much habitat and there's not
a penetration typically in applications
[SPEAKER_02]: for disinfectants to actually get in into
all that surface area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a little bit of a misnomer as
far as I'm concerned that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: sterilize anything biologically because
you can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot sterilize a root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot sterilize the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even sterilize a table.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can manage the concentration or the
population or density of different
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes if you do that well enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a root zone, it's absolutely impossible
to sticky sugar substance with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes in it no matter how you start.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would say is, you can either select
the microbes you want in there or let your
[SPEAKER_02]: environment select for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And typically, if you can have a choice of
putting beneficial microbes, knowingly
[SPEAKER_02]: putting beneficial microbes in that
substrate, in that root zone, you're
[SPEAKER_02]: mitigating a lot more risk than just
taking the chance that something from the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment is gonna come in, see and
occupy a space that's open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, because not all microbes are
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have learned so much from this podcast
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a feeling my audience has learned a
lot as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have just so much good knowledge here.
