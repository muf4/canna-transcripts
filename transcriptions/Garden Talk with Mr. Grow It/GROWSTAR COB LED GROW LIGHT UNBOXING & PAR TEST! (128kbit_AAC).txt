[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the GrowStar 600 Watt Cobb LED
grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I purchased this grow light off of Amazon
at a discount and in this video I am going
[SPEAKER_00]: to unbox the unit and also test the power
output.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing out of the box is the user
manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a ton of information about the grow
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some various safety information,
usage suggestions, specifications about
[SPEAKER_00]: the light, and warranty terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next is a wire hanging kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be going over all of the features
on this LED grow light, but I will provide
[SPEAKER_00]: a link in the description section below so
you can learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the power test, I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ500 power meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers, plus or minus 5
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers, and the measurements are taken
in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say this in every video, but this is
just to give you a general idea of what
[SPEAKER_00]: the power output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reflective walls in the grow tent
could increase the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the listing for this LED grow
light, it has a core coverage of 3.9 feet
[SPEAKER_00]: by 5 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.8 feet, which must be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: This grow light is a better fit for a 2
foot by 4 foot grow space, and I've placed
[SPEAKER_00]: this grow light in a 2 foot by 4 foot grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be taking measurements at 12 inches
away, 18 inches away, and 24 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like all the other power test videos
I do, I will let the measurements do the
[SPEAKER_00]: talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about these
measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I have provided a link to this grow
light in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and until next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
