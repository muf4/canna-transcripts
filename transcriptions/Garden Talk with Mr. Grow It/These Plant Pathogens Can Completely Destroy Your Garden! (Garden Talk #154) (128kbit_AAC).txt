[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody, for those of you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
podcast, this episode number 154.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Jackson
Farmer, also known as Farmer Freeman.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been gardening for 16 years and has a
bachelor's and a master's in biology from
[SPEAKER_01]: American University.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grows a variety of plants and he owns a
company that specializes in plant testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as DNA sex testing and testing for
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks all about various plant
pathogens, their symptoms, how to test for
[SPEAKER_01]: them, and how to combat them, if possible.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back and I'm joined with
Jackson Farmer, but some of you know him
[SPEAKER_01]: as Farmer Freeman.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, doing great, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on to the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to talk all about
various pathogens that can harm or
[SPEAKER_01]: completely kill your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are several different ones I'd
like to go over today and we might get
[SPEAKER_01]: into more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd also like to get into DNA sex
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, can you do an introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, my name is Jackson Farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the owner and operator of Farmer
Freeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a plant DNA lab based in Washington,
DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we primarily just perform testing
services for other growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our main thing is the plant DNA sex
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now we've ventured into doing
pathogen detection tests to further help
[SPEAKER_00]: them with their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 32 years old now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good friend whose mom was nice
enough to lend us a closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we built out a nice little grow tent
and ordered a bunch of stuff from HTG
[SPEAKER_00]: Supply, one of the original online grow
shops, got our seeds shipped from
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam, just the typical startup back
in the mid-thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was 16 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these days, I'm living in a different
state, living here in DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got the tent set up and a nice
little outdoor patio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know I was first introduced to you
and kind of your services.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeez, how long ago was that now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Five plus years ago or something like
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definitely pre-COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say like 2018, 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were definitely one of our first like
returning customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been an awesome relationship with
the shout outs and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of my audience is familiar with
you through kind of me using your services
[SPEAKER_01]: and promoting my videos and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still use it to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I sent over 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping to hear back the results
here by the end of the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully it was really fast turnaround
time, which we'll get into all that
[SPEAKER_01]: probably later on in this episode,
kind of the services that you offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a service that I use and
promote because I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe there's so many benefits to
doing the DNA sex testing, which we'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: into later on in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we actually linked up here and
started recording this episode behind the
[SPEAKER_01]: scenes, you mentioned that you wanted to
break these pathogens up into groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: First group being viruses and viroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second group being fungal root pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then third group being pathogens
affecting flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with the viruses and
viroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you break it down for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the different viruses and
viroids that affect medicinal plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the viruses and viroids in this
industry are a relatively new concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think hoplatin viroid was kind of
discovered and described in these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: just within the past 10 years,
whereas a lot of these other pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: like powdery mildew, I mean, that's been
talked about for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so these viruses and viroids,
hoplatin viroid is definitely the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common and most talked about viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the number one viroid test that we
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to cause stunting in your
plant, kind of weird, like narrow,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe discolored leaves, maybe leaves that
are growing at angles that are unlike your
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also notice your flowers will be
reduced in size and reduced in quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of all that, it's had a major
economic impact on commercial grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so since it's been described and
identified, companies like mine have been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to develop tests to detect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're seeing cultivations centers
by diligently testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to identify infected plants,
remove them from their facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just keep their facilities operating
at 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can spread quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've heard of some facilities
basically having to chop down everything
[SPEAKER_00]: and start from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's heartbreaking to hear about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other viruses would be beet
curly top virus, lettuce chlorosis virus,
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco mosaic virus is one that gets
talked about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these though, at least from what
our lab can tell, they're incredibly rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of submissions for tobacco
mosaic virus just because people will see
[SPEAKER_00]: discoloration or mosaic type patterning or
patterns on their leaf surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so many other reasons that
could happen, like basically any number of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient deficiencies, even genetics can
cause that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we very rarely ever see a sample that
actually has tobacco mosaic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people still want to test for it just
to be sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one that's been in tobacco
plants for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually like the first virus or
viroid ever like kind of described in
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can kind of persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're just handling tobacco or
tobacco products, you can get the viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: on your fingers or surfaces and start
spreading it just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beet curly top is interesting because as
the name kind of alludes to, it's from the
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar beet plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's relatively new to our
industry because in the past, the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that we grow and my customers grow have
been like kind of hidden or relegated to
[SPEAKER_00]: very confined growing spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas these days you can more easily
grow them outdoors in larger fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see like a lot of traditional farms
start to incorporate this new plant group
[SPEAKER_00]: into their kind of commercial operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, they're in closer
proximity to things like sugar beets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to see bugs that would
typically be found on sugar beets start to
[SPEAKER_00]: just literally, they're called like leaf
hoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just little bugs that hop from
plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because our plants are now outdoors in
these traditional farms, we're seeing new
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases pop up in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the beet curly top virus,
again, it's really rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a couple of submissions every now
and then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rarely ever see one positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that people submit it is
kind of like tobacco mosaic where the
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms of a lot of these diseases can be
so similar to each other and just very,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I want to say like kind of like
genetic looking symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a curling leaf or narrow leaf or
maybe a bright yellow leaf are all
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms of beet curly top, but that's
also symptoms of over and under watering
[SPEAKER_00]: and various nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of challenging to provide
guidance on if you should test for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beet curly top is kind of nice because
it's kind of regionally controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find, you see it like in Colorado,
New Mexico, California, basically these
[SPEAKER_00]: areas where beet sugar beets are grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, you know, we don't
recommend it for someone growing outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: in Maine, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beet curly top virus and the lettuce
chlorosis virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anybody who's gotten those
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty interesting to hear that
you don't really get many positives coming
[SPEAKER_01]: into your testing center, which is pretty
interesting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a relief, I guess you can say that
it's more of a rare occurrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you saying it's, is it more rare
for indoor growers versus outdoor growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you were talking about beet curly
and kind of being outdoors and
[SPEAKER_01]: transferring that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say it's mostly outdoors that
there's a concern?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're growing indoors or even if
your greenhouse is like very isolated and
[SPEAKER_00]: not near any like, um, you know,
weeds or, you know, like just random
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, then I don't think you have to
worry about beet curly top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you're getting a clone or a cut
from a farm that, that maybe has beet
[SPEAKER_00]: curly top, you should be concerned,
but, um, yeah, I would only recommend it
[SPEAKER_00]: for like outdoor grows in these certain
parts of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we, we really just got our first beet
curly top positive sample, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: a few weeks ago and, um, it was
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, it was, it was so interesting
actually that I contacted, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the other labs I work with and they
had never actually heard of anyone having
[SPEAKER_00]: this, which is funny that, you know,
we all test for these things, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they're still rare, but it's just kind
of shows like how valuable our crops are
[SPEAKER_00]: and that we, you know, know that we need
to be testing for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just to protect the crop at all costs
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, so that other lab was
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, can your customer go and
catch some of these bugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, let's figure out which bugs
are actually transferring this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how long do they survive in the plant
or in the, in the bug?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, and I mean, basically
getting to the, to the basics of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's all very new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's an exciting space to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also, um, you know, kind of
challenging in that there's just so much
[SPEAKER_00]: on the line with these diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as far as testing for them goes,
um, it's a little bit different than,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, a test for these other pathogens or
plant sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so viruses are RNA based as opposed to
DNA based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, just slightly different,
uh, collection of samples, preservation of
[SPEAKER_00]: samples, and, um, different kind of,
uh, enzymes and stuff go, go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can use a lot of the same
equipment, but it is like a, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: we consider it like a totally separate
thing than, than the plant sex test or
[SPEAKER_00]: these other pathogen tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a hot blade and viroid test I
submitted into you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember going through the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you walk us through it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I remember correctly, I had to take a
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to take samples of three different
sections, leaves of a three different
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the plant and also the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how it still is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we've been recommending.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually, when we first started,
we weren't doing root samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, until it just became pretty,
pretty publicly known or kind of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific consensus, um, started to,
to appear that root samples are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be one of your best, uh, sources,
uh, to detect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and yeah, so because we don't know
that much about your plants, like we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't really, uh, we're very low key.
[SPEAKER_00]: We supply you these, um, collection kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the testing, but we're not like
prying into your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't ask like a bunch of information
about your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, uh, you know,
we, we want to get like a, a well rounded
[SPEAKER_00]: collection of samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: From your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so like you said, top middle bottom
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whereas like if we knew specifically,
like if you told us, Hey, I have a brand
[SPEAKER_00]: new clone, then we might just say,
Hey, one, one top leaf should be
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so when we get those samples,
we, because we don't always know like what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of plant it came from, we generally
like, we'll kind of combine all of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, leaf samples together and basically
just trying to get a, uh, a good
[SPEAKER_00]: composition of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A representative, um, a good
representation of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as far as stability of viroids,
I actually did have somebody on my podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: before talking specifically about hot
blade and viroids, and I took notes on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as stability greater than 24
hours, it stays on most common surfaces,
[SPEAKER_01]: seven weeks within water, greater than 90
days in fermented compost, six months on
[SPEAKER_01]: most dried plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several months, hot blade and viroid can
be in your soil or growing medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then years inside of a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very stable, uh, from what I hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to ask you testing for
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can people submit in seeds feed to test?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've not validated our hot plate and
viroid test on seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think in theory it should be
possible, but it's just like a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of work that we'd like to do before we
start, you know, accepting your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your money, uh, for that type of service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, like you just mentioned,
uh, it's incredibly stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, um, some leaf samples that will
periodically pull out, uh, that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: are positive because we tested them a few
years ago and, uh, we'll just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, every couple of months,
pull it out, test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just consistently shows up positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I guess there's nothing really in
that dried plant material that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cause the virus to go away or viroid to go
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like you said, incredibly stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're working with dried plant
material, uh, you should definitely,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, clean up your, your hands and
stuff before you get into, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the cultivation rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep me updated on seed testing because
I'm 100% down to submit in stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can be your guinea pig if you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One last thing about hot plate and viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel it's over exaggerated?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of people that are screaming
hot plate and viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the worst thing to come around in
this generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it over exaggerated or is it a
legitimate concern that is infecting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people say greater than 90% of grows
are infected by this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not seeing anywhere near that 90%
of grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think, you know, our results are
going to be a little biased because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we have a lot of people
submitting samples just as a preventative
[SPEAKER_00]: measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to us going into grows,
finding the worst looking plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling and testing those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's not to say like,
uh, the impact is over exaggerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's definitely a devastating to,
to get into a commercial grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're like a home grower and
you, you know, grow from seed and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: do a couple cycles a year for plants,
you know, four to 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, um, you know, it's going to
be as impactful as, as if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facility where, you know,
your, your employer, your employee's
[SPEAKER_00]: payroll is on the line of, you know,
every single harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think it kind of depends on who
you are and how you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, but certainly you, if you have it
in your facility, you start to see that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that quality drop, that yield drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you have to figure out how to,
how to get rid of that or start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, you, you can't live with it,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one thing for the tobacco mosaic
virus, you had mentioned you get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: submissions in for that, but not many
positive results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I've got a feeling on why that
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a lot of these websites that post
about tobacco mosaic virus and the showing
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures of plants with what looks to be
variegation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's some confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: People see variegation on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They match it up to what people are
showing as tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think there's some confusion
happening and maybe that's why you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting so many submissions in there
because it's just misinformation amongst
[SPEAKER_01]: the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you think that's about potential or
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we have customers try to send us
pictures, you know, and have us diagnosed
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I would, I'd never
recommend you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's a whole lot more context
that that's needed to, to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: even just make a guess on, on what it
could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like if someone had a picture of a
curling leaf, but it's an indoor garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's no way I'd say that's be
curly top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and so, yeah, like you,
you mentioned, um, these people,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll go online, find a picture of
tobacco mosaic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it looks like what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens with like, um,
trying to diagnose nutrient deficiencies
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, where you'll think you have one
certain deficiency just based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you like read the ingredients in
that bottle of nutrients you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll, you'll probably have a better
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wait, this is totally missing zinc or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really more for like tissue
testing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to do tissue testing,
you could get a more accurate diagnosis of
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrients in the plan, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever thought about offering
tissue testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you don't do it now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, no, it's not something we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, definitely have thought about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the thing about the, uh, tissue
testing, uh, plant nutrient testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, at least from what I understand,
like the, the sample quality is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a big impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like you maybe want a fresh,
like non dried samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it a little more challenging
to, um, you know, submit to the
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, any kind of degradation during transit
could, could impact it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whereas like with these genetic based
tests, like, like that RNA and that DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're scanning for is going to be
very stable, uh, regardless of the sample
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, so that's primarily why we don't
do it is because we don't want to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with like trying to keep all this
stuff fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's also, you know, larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need like whole leaves, uh,
stems, stocks, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it just requires like a larger
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do like a whole lot with just the
small space that we're currently in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, when we work with
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to fungal root pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us all about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be primarily if you
say, um, and pythiums, uh, pythium
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are kind of newer tests that we
offer, um, where we're generally testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, root samples of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you definitely want to test your,
your incoming clones, incoming,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, moms, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because you know, once this fungus
gets into your soil or your water supply,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be kind of challenging to get rid
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, Fusarium and Pythium,
um, kind of unlike Hoplatin, Hoplatin will
[SPEAKER_00]: cause like a slow decline in your plant
quality, but it won't like outright kill
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Fusarium and Pythium will,
uh, kill your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pythium can cause, uh, browning of
your roots, root rot, uh, crown rot,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that kind of results in like
stunted wilted yellow leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually, uh, death of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium is similar where you start to see
like brown dead areas of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, again, your,
your leaves become yellow, start wilting
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and it'll just lead to total crop
loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so yeah, those are new tests that we
highly recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot more positivity in those two
tests than we do for, for, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, other pathogens like tobacco
mosaic or, uh, botrytis, um, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the Pythium, correct me if I'm wrong
there, but is this really weighted towards
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic systems like deep water
culture, RDWC?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear a lot of people who come across
these fungal pathogens because of too high
[SPEAKER_01]: of temperature, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if their water reservoir is over 75
degrees, 75 degrees, I guess you'd get
[SPEAKER_01]: away with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's upwards of 80 degrees or even
higher, you could potentially get Pythium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I in the ballpark there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so yeah, Fusarium and Pythium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they love hot, wet, uh, environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so yeah, uh, hydroponic grow or
even soil, if it's just like continuously
[SPEAKER_00]: watered, uh, you know, you're just
creating a great environment for those,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, uh, species to, to, uh, thrive in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would be the solution to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know, like, is there any like
products or anything that people could put
[SPEAKER_01]: into their DWC system, for example,
to help eliminate those fungal pathogens?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about specific products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's definitely like nutrient
brands that will kind of advertise like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, these maybe have like some,
uh, biocidal, uh, properties within the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll, they'll help keep your,
your reservoirs, you know, cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping your, your reservoir water cool is
going to be good to just kind of slow
[SPEAKER_00]: growth of any kind of fungus like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started in DWC actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my main concern was keeping that water
temperature under control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, unfortunately my concerns have been
legitimatized because I checked the water
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature inside like 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I am now and I'm leaving,
I'm seeing browning on the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm almost in, you know,
borderline panic mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, luckily I don't have a real valuable
plant in there right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have more cuttings that I could use
so I could eliminate the plant that's in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it gets really bad, but I am seeing the
browning of the roots and there is concern
[SPEAKER_01]: for a fungal pathogen pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I was just wondering some
background on that and if there was a way
[SPEAKER_01]: to get rid of it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean there's fungicides,
um, that, that can maybe target these
[SPEAKER_00]: specific, uh, species and cause minimal
impact or no impact to your actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so maybe check out those, um,
cause I mean these have been infecting,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, commercial crops, ornamental plants,
things like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's like a lot of research
that's gone into these as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: these, um, industry specific pathogens,
keeping your plant just like generally,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, healthy, you know, your plants have
immune systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if your plant is, is happy and
healthy, it's going to be better at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of suppressing the effects
of, of these fungus diseases if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: present in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, but you know,
once your plant gets sick, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with Fusarium, then maybe Pythium or
hoplite and thyroid finds a better
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to come in, um, or,
or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as the testing process,
you mentioned root samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you walk us through that process?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, if somebody's in soil,
they're digging down in the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: digging out a root sample, how long should
it be if you're in a DWC system?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, same deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, taking out, drying off the roots
and then putting them into the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the package to ship out or how does that
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this information definitely
subject to change, like as we learn more
[SPEAKER_00]: about best practices for sampling and you
know, the kind of hotspots on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, so for those right now,
we, we recommend root samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we only need like one or two inches of
root sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, ideally, uh, cleaned off, uh,
any like excessive dirt and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause that's just going to save us a lot
of time in the lab of having to clean
[SPEAKER_00]: your, your stuff before we can even test
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, you'll kind of dig around
the base of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's in soil, uh, try to pull up some
of those root hairs that are coming off
[SPEAKER_00]: that central stock, um, or like DWC or,
or, you know, if you have like rock wool
[SPEAKER_00]: on a flood table or something,
uh, you can just clip some of the exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: roots from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and yeah, it doesn't need to be much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have minimal impact on your,
your plants, um, growth or health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on your website, you have a
listing for Fusarium detection tests and
[SPEAKER_01]: then one right next to it, pan Fusarium
detection test and it's a $20 more.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the difference between those two?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pan Fusarium test is going to
screen for, uh, more than more species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so Fusarium is the genus, uh,
and then there's like Fusarium oxysporum
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of different Fusarium
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the first test that we offered was
Fusarium oxysporum specific, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just over time, you know, spent
development and testing to, to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: target more species and, you know,
be a slightly more efficient effective
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we still have a lot of the Fusarium
oxysporum specific reagents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, until we run out of that,
we're, we're gonna, we're gonna test for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else to be said about
the fungal root pathogens or should we
[SPEAKER_01]: move on to the pathogens affecting
flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil testing can be, um, something to
consider when testing for these fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: root pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we, you know, you can, as opposed
to like sending root samples, you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I mean, our lab doesn't have like a
whole protocol for this, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in theory you can, um, do a, you know,
a test from the soil directly to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: that fungus is present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that can help you decide,
like, do we want to plant in this area of
[SPEAKER_00]: the field or, uh, find a different area
that, you know, maybe it's not present or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's present in lower amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to pathogens affecting
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they, the symptoms, what do the
plants look like when they're infected,
[SPEAKER_01]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you're, you're above ground,
um, kind of targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the main things, I think the,
the, the one that almost everyone knows
[SPEAKER_00]: about is powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where you have those like little
white spots, um, you know, on your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your, uh, plant leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or within, you know, the, the flower
itself, um, they start to emerge like
[SPEAKER_00]: early on in the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and basically just, uh, if you,
if you don't catch it and get rid of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're gonna have, uh, a product
that's basically unusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so generally spread through,
through clones and just sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what has been kind of debated about
powdery mildew is, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it only on the surface of the plant or
can it be found inside of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so there's, there's evidence that
it can vascularize into the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you don't have any visible
symptoms of it, uh, we recommend testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, especially if you're like in kind of
a, a humid environment where that fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: can, can more easily, um, grow,
uh, then, then we definitely recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: testing for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the other one, uh, botrytis is,
um, generally called bud rot or gray mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so that's found within the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you, you'll find it after you
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that can also just, you know,
completely wreck your, your, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, these, you know, all of these,
I recommend to test, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: on incoming clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're already seeing these
things come up, it's not really worth
[SPEAKER_00]: testing for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at that point you need to get
into, um, you know, how do we,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we remove this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are there, are there products
that we can apply to treat the plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: should we just get rid of the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, completely for the powdery mildew,
you hear people trying to wash it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do a search on YouTube,
wash powdery mildew or his Arvantes put
[SPEAKER_01]: out a video 13 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember when he put this one out,
cause it caused it caused a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: controversy where I think he's doing some
sort of hydrogen peroxide solution and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's he's harvested the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he's washing gin in this solution,
and then he's hanging it to dry after the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say that's an effective approach
or would you say that's not effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're dealing with,
you know, a fungal thing like powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew, I wouldn't want any moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I'm not like an expert,
uh, grower like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One can probably speculate that since you
said it, there's evidence now that's
[SPEAKER_01]: inside the plant that just washing it off
the leaves isn't sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That video has 625,000 views.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can only imagine how many people
actually, uh, tried the process and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, potentially think they're
washing it off completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately it might be internally
in the plant and they're consuming that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know for the botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is something I've come across
before and I had bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've told this story on my channel several
times, not fun to come across at all,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, towards the end of the grow
these massive colas and open it up in this
[SPEAKER_01]: bud rot on the inside, you know,
but I tried to scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did back then was I cut off the
infected parts and I kept the other parts
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant and I consumed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now some people say that you shouldn't do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should need, you should dispose a part
of the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's like enough
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the, into like the human health
effects of like ingesting something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, there's plenty of
better plant material out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not worth the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, yeah, I'm not, I'm not sure about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the concerns is that
there's spores, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spores and they're easily able to go
airborne.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're rummaging around with that
bud that has botrytis, it's going airborne
[SPEAKER_01]: and potentially getting on other parts of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's what one of the main
concerns was, but yeah, I understand that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's just not enough research out
there, evidence to show one way or the
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so another pathogen that we test for
is uh, russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so again, we recommend like if you
getting a clone or if you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in an area that, that has had
issues with those before, then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably worth testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we can detect just that russet
mite DNA from, from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: eggs or anything that's invisible to the
naked eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we can detect that on the leaf
through, uh, just genetic testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't even aware that you offered that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that testing process consist of?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the pathogen that's affecting flowers,
is that the leaf samples or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would want leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, um, I think if you're in a
flowering stage, then leaves closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: your flowers would be suggested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if it's a clone, then just one or two
leaves from, just try to get like a
[SPEAKER_00]: representation of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, we can't test the entire
plant unfortunately, cause we would
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, we, we want to get,
you know, a sufficient amount of material
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that leaves everyone confident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, so for those tests,
we, we don't bother asking for roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now are there any other pathogens that we
should be aware of that maybe you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: personally offer as a service to test for,
but they're out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to get into details on
them, but just kind of giving us a list,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the viewers could conduct their
own research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've heard of like hemp streak virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not sure how prevalent that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, I really couldn't speak on
other, other things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I'm not like in that kind of
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have anything else on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to DNA sex testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us all about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does the testing process consist of?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like our, uh, bread and butter
at Farmer Freeman is, uh, the plant DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: sex test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically help you sort out which
seedlings you want to grow or not grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, based on your, your goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so obviously the female plants are the
ones that make the flowers, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: that have made this industry so popular,
uh, whereas male plants, um, will make
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once those open up and release pollen,
your females get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They divert all their energy into seed
production rather than nice flower
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely want to be, uh, eliminating
male plants as early as possible if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not interested in, in using them for
breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so typically in the past,
you would have to, um, visually identify
[SPEAKER_00]: the sex of your plant, you know,
while it's in the, that flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ring stage at least like four or six weeks
after, uh, the plant sprouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, but by looking at the DNA of the
plant, we can tell you just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: within seven to 10 days after sprouting,
whether it's a male or female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so all we need for that is just a
piece of leaf or stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically anything that's going to have
that plant's DNA in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can, uh, take that DNA out and then we
screen it for the presence of a Y
[SPEAKER_00]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, which is only going to be found in the
male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we find it, we tag it male.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't, we tag it female and say,
you know, good luck with the rest of your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, uh, have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been, you know, just a huge time
and resource saver for our customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're not having to, uh,
you know, spend resources like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, water, nutrients, soil, uh,
growing these plants out for, for an extra
[SPEAKER_00]: few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, rather they're just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, getting rid of those plants before
they're even out of like their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their seedling tray, um, it could save
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I mean, not just the resource
savings, but the, the risk of mitigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, no one's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely stories of people,
um, not noticing that their plant is a
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that, that can be reduced by,
by actually testing rather than relying on
[SPEAKER_00]: a visual identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely recommend the plant success,
like for a new grower, uh, because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're investing and, you know,
if you, if you're starting from scratch,
[SPEAKER_00]: buying a tent, buying bags of soil,
um, you're going to save so many resources
[SPEAKER_00]: by growing, you know, only the,
the 50% of plants that you need,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that, that 50% that are going to
be female, you're only growing those only
[SPEAKER_00]: investing into the resources to grow
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's definitely a time saver for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned to you earlier,
I just submitted 12 in, so I had seedlings
[SPEAKER_01]: sprout from the medium within,
I think it was like day four, day five
[SPEAKER_01]: after being sprouted, I had enough leaf to
take off samples, shipped them out to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm just waiting to hear back,
but I guess once you receive them,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's usually within 24 hours is I'm
getting a, a email back with the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I take those results and I can
kill off all the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, saving time,
space, saving time, saving money on
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like my goal is to have a result back
and not have to transplant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to have to spend time going
from a solo cup transplanting up only to
[SPEAKER_01]: find out it's a male guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm going to wipe that off and then
time wasted on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a big fan of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will continue to use that service.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been using it since 2018 or whatever we
first, we first got introduced and I did
[SPEAKER_01]: actually send in a way back then I was
like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to test this service.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to send an all feminized,
and let's see what result and it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred percent accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always been, it's been a hundred
percent accurate the entire time I've,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my experience, it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have one question in regards to this
and I think it's a big question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably a common question for you is
can hermaphrodite plants be detected
[SPEAKER_01]: during DNA sex testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, that's definitely like our
number one most asked question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, hermaphrodite plants can be
either genetically male or genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, most of the time you'll notice it from
a, you know, a result that we call female,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, because that's the plant that you're
going to be keeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you did keep and grow all those
male plants too, you'll start to see that
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them are also a herm and will grow
flowers in addition to their pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so unfortunately like that Y
chromosomes not required for pollen sack
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll still see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It come up and your genetic females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't think anyone's identified like
a foolproof, a gene that can be detected.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, okay, if your plant has this,
it will do, it will be a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think there's probably a couple
different, um, kind of like genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: pathways for a plant to, to go through,
to, to, um, to start to express that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, yeah, so unfortunately we
can't, but, um, if you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what to expect from your plants,
if you know, like these fit, these five
[SPEAKER_00]: should be female and these five should be
male and they start to look off,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, then, then, you know, you might be
dealing with a herm and, uh, go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I definitely think that
there's some people out there who,
[SPEAKER_00]: they grow a plant, they see pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's male.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start breeding with it and they're
unknowingly creating, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds, uh, because they didn't
actually confirm if that plant was male or
[SPEAKER_00]: female before they started using that
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, no, we, we can't detect,
uh, herms, unfortunately, but when we do,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will definitely let everyone know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think that'll be a huge,
uh, game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who uses DNA sex testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just home growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing commercial facilities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a lot as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, by, by numbers, like the majority
of our customers are going to be home
[SPEAKER_00]: growers or caregivers, like growing,
you know, under 20 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, but then we do have a lot of,
you know, cultivation facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: like big commercial clients who are,
you know, doing, doing pheno hunts,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, planting hundreds of seeds at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, then submitting those samples to
us and, and then, you know, just over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of a day, eliminating, you know,
a couple of hundred plants and saving
[SPEAKER_00]: their, their facility, a whole lot of
wasted space and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, pretty much, um, we,
we, we work with the whole spectrum of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, cultivation styles and sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And taking a step back and looking at the
future, what do you think the future looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like in regards to plant pathogens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there are going to be new
ones that pop up and what does the future
[SPEAKER_01]: look like for plant pathogen testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you foresee better technology coming
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, so I think definitely we'll see
more pathogens start to be identified and
[SPEAKER_00]: described, especially as, um, these plants
are, start to be grown in environments
[SPEAKER_00]: that they weren't before, such as like,
um, you know, uh, a traditional outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: farms, you know, they're, they're then
next to, um, a crop that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: no one's really grown it next to before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might see some, some kind of
disease transmission, um, that'll
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually get described.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole new, new industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a lot of new
environments and a lot of new things
[SPEAKER_00]: popping up that'll, that'll come up and
get described.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll develop tests for,
um, as far as like the future of testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, kind of like the evolution of our
Fusarium tests, where we were only testing
[SPEAKER_00]: for Fusarium oxysporum for a while,
uh, because that was the most common
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, eventually, you know,
that, that product's evolved to now test
[SPEAKER_00]: for multiple species of Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think you'll start to see more
tests, like kind of tests become more
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive in their scope, uh,
as opposed to just like very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: single target tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you'll also see, you know,
testing price, uh, reduced as,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, testing labs and manufacturers
you know, uh, enhance their testing
[SPEAKER_00]: volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's just like the, the natural cycle
of, um, how this goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a race to the bottom
and, and, you know, how cheap can you get
[SPEAKER_00]: your reagents?
[SPEAKER_00]: How cheap can you perform the,
the testing service?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you'll see, you know, better scope,
better technology, uh, cheaper pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll also start to see, um, there's a
couple of companies out there now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, but trying to like, you know,
let the consumer be able to test their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so as opposed to like relying on a
third party testing lab, uh, they can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, buy kits or buy certain pieces
of equipment and perform these tests on
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's going to be really helpful
for people like in, uh, in more rural
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or if you like are just super
secretive about your operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and you want to just maintain as much
privacy as you can, um, then, then the,
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll be helpful for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be interesting to see what comes
about in the future on that Avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Jackson, this has been an awesome
episode, really informative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I learned a lot and I'm sure my
audience learned a lot as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, we're farmer Freeman.com,
uh, farmer Freeman easy X Y on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, we just, like I mentioned,
uh, better tests, cheaper tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, that's all coming down in
the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a big sale coming up in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you and a lot of our other,
uh, long time customers know they can rely
[SPEAKER_00]: on sales twice a year for us black Friday
and four 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, we have a new website launching
soon that I'm really excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'll be at MJ biz con for the first
time this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, never been to that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to go check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to have a booth,
but I'm definitely going to bring some
[SPEAKER_00]: swag and try to meet as many customers as
I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's, there's so many of you that I
haven't met face to face yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited to do that in December.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's link up for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, definitely have a link to Jackson's
website, farmer Freeman down in the
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're on one of the podcast
platforms, just search for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find them.

[SPEAKER_01]: Jackson, once again, thanks so much for
coming out of the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a great overview of the
different groups of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a lot of helpful
information that my audience is really
[SPEAKER_01]: gaining some value from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much.
