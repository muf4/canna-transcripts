[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening, and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk Podcast, this episode
number 108.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Adam Dunn.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for 30 years,
and is the host of the Adam Dunn Show,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm sure a large handful of you are
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has experience growing with several
types of hydroponic systems, and also has
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with organic gardening,
and that's what we talk about in today's
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, Organic vs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see highlights of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk Clips
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a channel dedicated to short clips
of these podcast episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to acknowledge that one of my goals
for this podcast is to bring free
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening information of all plants to the
general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode, who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to AAC Infinity for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They now have supplemental lighting,
called the Ion Beam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the Ion Beam S11 grow light bars,
which are 11 inches long, and use Samsung
[SPEAKER_00]: LM301H diodes, but they also have the Ion
Beam S16, which are 16 inches long,
[SPEAKER_00]: and use the same diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with a light controller,
with four light intensity levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: and timer settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a link in the description
section below, so you can learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: their supplemental lighting, and the
discount code MrGrowd15 works on both
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon and their website, AACInfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm joined with Adam Dunn.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've been requested by a large
handful of my viewers, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with your show, which I'm sure
you'll talk about in your introduction
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before the introduction, let's reveal
the topic, organic gardening versus
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've done both methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really interested to hear how
you've grown those ways, tips,
[SPEAKER_00]: tricks, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you introduce yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Adam Dunn, and I've been into
gardening now for 30 plus years,
[SPEAKER_01]: it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy how time flies, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was growing up, my dad,
my grandfather was a head groundskeeper at
[SPEAKER_01]: a golf course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had the greenest lawn in the block.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you come down our street,
it was all crabgrass everywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: except for our house, perfectly green
grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he always had a good garden and kind
of Greek heritage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they tend to love to have their little
victory gardens still.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was back in New England, which is an
amazing place for growing anything really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're out here in Colorado now,
it's dry and there's quite limiting on
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go back to East Coast and see my
friends growing pumpkins and things and
[SPEAKER_01]: just like, wow, the corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the quality of the vegetables and
things coming out of there is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born and raised in Massachusetts,
and now I live in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Massive difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly the same vibe difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the lack of humidity makes a huge
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Colorado, we are constantly
battling that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's never enough water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very dry out there,
similar to how it is where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about your show?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that all come about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of things, evolution of... I
came to Colorado in 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in Amsterdam for 21 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I came here in 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on a lot of other people's shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on the John Doe radio show,
which was like a local show here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really instrumental,
I think, because it really... His show was
[SPEAKER_01]: like a beacon that brought people to
Colorado because they were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe this is happening,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they all came out to see the changes
happening in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I rolled into town and I was like,
yeah, I'll come on your podcast and hung
[SPEAKER_01]: out with them a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized I really quite liked the
format.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of stories, you know what I
mean, after living there for so long and
[SPEAKER_01]: really felt like it was a good medium to
work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's been 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes so, again, like time flies,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of a sudden it's 10 years later and
we're still rocking and rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, as you know, podcasting right now
is like the last sort of free creative
[SPEAKER_01]: place to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're not working for somebody
else, if you're doing your own thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can create your own lane, which is
rare in this world, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very few things that you can
actually do that with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like podcasting is a great way
to get to people and connect on a real
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I love the, I love the no rules
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those tuning in, particularly on
YouTube, I'll definitely have a link to
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam's channel down in the YouTube
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're tuning in on one of the
podcast platforms, just search for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Adam Dunn show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll pop right up on, on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on podcast platforms as well,
or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're thinking around like nine different
platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we go through restream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they go on, on all of them and it's
been, it's actually the numbers have been
[SPEAKER_01]: going crazy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I've been, you know,
I really don't pay attention to those
[SPEAKER_01]: things and I'm not really like beholden to
numbers and trying to get higher
[SPEAKER_01]: viewership and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we have noticed is, you know,
just organically it's grown over time and
[SPEAKER_01]: now we're hitting like, you know,
150,000 a month or something like that on
[SPEAKER_01]: average, which is, you know, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you could just imagine 150,000
people in one place, it's quite a good
[SPEAKER_01]: crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You start getting those crowds together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, all right, we're getting
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congrats on all your success.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not easy to do at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge accomplishment there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the key, the key to the whole
thing, if anybody out there is listening
[SPEAKER_01]: and they want to start a podcast,
number one thing is be consistent,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, don't think you can do one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, wow, maybe a few months later,
I'll do another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody, nobody thought they want to see
you on, you know, like we literally,
[SPEAKER_01]: we missed a couple here and there,
but it's always been just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: major circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, it's always like,
you feel it in your heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I gotta, I gotta do this,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're waiting on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can vouch for that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistency is definitely key when it
comes to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worst thing is when somebody says,
Oh, is that podcast still on?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure people know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into our topic today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start with hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know to begin, what hydroponic
systems are you familiar with and what
[SPEAKER_00]: ones have you used in the past?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was living in Holland,
actually, so when I moved there in 89,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was like, you know, that is like,
that is like the, the, the crown jewel of
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as far as it's either,
it's either Ein Gedi in Israel or it's Al
[SPEAKER_01]: Smear in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are like the two critical spots,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Al Smear is where all the greenhouses are
outside of, outside of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when you fly in,
right, that's the thing as a, as a grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you fly into Amsterdam, it's almost
like now a days flying into Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You come in at night and you see all the
lights and you're like, that's a grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a grow, that's a grow, that's a
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can spot them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Holland, right, the airport is
right where the greenhouses are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you land, it's like, you're coming
into like, there it is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it really gets you going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I got there, I really wanted to
learn everything I could about
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really was super focused on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was into aeroponics at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I became the, after a while I
became the distributor for general
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics in the Netherlands,
which, you know, now if I look back,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh my God, I like, I literally
had the, I had them by the balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, I was really like,
Oh, I have the best food in the world
[SPEAKER_01]: because really general hydro definitely
changed the game for indoor growers on
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics because it really gave you an
ability to adjust your formulas a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it was just minor adjustments,
like two, one, one or two, two,
[SPEAKER_01]: one, or, you know, you just, it was quite
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had your grow your flower,
your micro, and you could bounce in back
[SPEAKER_01]: and forth between those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Holland, it was like, you know,
they're growing on acres and acres and
[SPEAKER_01]: acres of greenhouse, like massive scale,
flowers, vegetables, everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, everything under the sun,
but they're also doing it from a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a Dutch pragmatic economy of
scale type situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you start talking acres of
anything, every penny counts, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so for them, hydroponics is based on
economy and it's based on the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: push things through the system fast
because they have, you know, the largest
[SPEAKER_01]: flower distribution centers in Holland,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, they, the airport had to
have their own area at the airport where
[SPEAKER_01]: they do their auctions and they bring all
the flowers in, bring it all in,
[SPEAKER_01]: ship them all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to imagine that's like a well,
well oiled machine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they have, they can grow a plant
and have it in a store in 48 hours from
[SPEAKER_01]: the time it gets cut, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just anywhere in the world,
which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I went there like, like it was
church, you know, I was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my God, I'm going out to, I'd go out to
Alsmere and I'd go to these greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: supply centers and walk around and had no
idea what I was looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just, just overwhelmed, you know,
but I started working for Sensi Seeds in
[SPEAKER_01]: 93.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that kind of got me, got me more on
the smaller, like got me more realistic
[SPEAKER_01]: size systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the thing is when I went to Alsmere,
I just was like, where to start,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about these million dollar
greenhouses and it just was way over my
[SPEAKER_01]: head.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I started working at Sensi,
we started with a very passive hydroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a, it was like probably the
most easy, least sort of active system
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've ever worked with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a, I used a, basically it was
like a cement, cement mixing container,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to classic black ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, they put a water level meter in
the bottom, which is a plastic water level
[SPEAKER_01]: meter, put an ion exchanger on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the key to the whole thing
was this ion exchanger, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like a little polymer balls,
little red polymer balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you sprinkle that down at the bottom
of the container and you fill it up with
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro corals with your, with your
hydrostones there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you set your, you basically
would put your rock wall blocks on top and
[SPEAKER_01]: top feed them until the roots made it to
the bottom of the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd be top feeding very lightly,
you know, just kind of coaxing the roots
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once the roots got to the bottom
where the water would be, cause you'd fill
[SPEAKER_01]: your water level, maybe, you know,
a couple inches at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, that was their considered
hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that is technically it's
hydroponics, but it's like so inactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no, nothing happening,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was always like, sitting there
watching it going like, it's gotta be more
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I'm so used to these, looking at
these other systems, they've got injectors
[SPEAKER_01]: and they've got all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it felt like it wasn't, I wasn't
involved enough, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I ended up poking the hole in the
bottom of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting them drain in there, screwed
everything up right out of the gate
[SPEAKER_01]: because I let all the ion exchanger out,
which I didn't, you know, I didn't get the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole system, but that whole, that just
those little polymers was the key to the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole system because they took in
extra, you know, they took in any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: extra salts and things and kept it away
from the roots and balanced the pH where
[SPEAKER_01]: once I got rid of it, I was like,
oh, so I quickly learned, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's with hydroponics, it's a system
and the system is important, but it's also
[SPEAKER_01]: really based on you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you, you know, forget to do one
thing or contaminate something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, I learned quite quickly that it
was, there was a lot of moving parts and
[SPEAKER_01]: not in that system in particular,
cause that's why I was pissed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I want any more action.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the next thing I built went
straight from that to aeroponics because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my mind, hydroponics meant like
complicated things with lots of,
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed to, I needed to make it,
which I didn't realize down the road that
[SPEAKER_01]: that was the exact reason why I stopped,
you know, but in the beginning it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's because a lot of people,
a lot of people are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're very into the, into the tweaking,
you know, and I felt like with,
[SPEAKER_01]: with this, with my hydro systems that I
was building, you know, I was really into
[SPEAKER_01]: the construction of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went out and built my own aeroponics
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked online, it wasn't even online
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked in a book, imagine that a book,
and I was looking at the systems and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, oh, those are PVC pipes with,
with little baskets in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I went to the, back to the supply
center that I'd gone to, the Ellesmere
[SPEAKER_01]: with all these parts and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started to just build them in the,
in the aisles, you know, I'd stand in the
[SPEAKER_01]: aisle and like, okay, if I take this
sprayer and have to figure out the gallons
[SPEAKER_01]: per minute and, you know, try to figure
out a calculate something that would work
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of bought this whole,
all these little bits and pieces and took
[SPEAKER_01]: them back to my place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, we built this system and it was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we overbuilt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we had the, we had access to the
best of the best when it came to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic equipment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was all like, you had to know what
it was, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was Frankensteining everything like,
Oh, I'll take this piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it connected to this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had no idea what I was doing,
but I made a system that worked,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I made it too good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was way overbuilt classic,
classic, like, you know, later on when I
[SPEAKER_01]: realized how much I, you know,
I had UV, I had UV for the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like, I went full, full stop,
you know, the water would be cleaned by
[SPEAKER_01]: UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would go back into the system and the
sprayers were the ones that would spin,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so they would make a lot of
noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm in an apartment in Amsterdam,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Amsterdam, the apartments are
small.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have 16 amps of power, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 amps for the entire apartment,
including your fridge, including whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: else you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you start thinking about how you're
going to, how you're going to grow in a
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: With 16 amps, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always like a real struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I built this system, had it all set up,
turned it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within five seconds, I already knew I
made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Oh my God, I think I overbuilt
this thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it started to like 30 of those little
sprayers were going off inside these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instantly my neighbor just starts
banging on my ceiling or his ceiling on my
[SPEAKER_01]: floor, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh, now what do I got to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I realized this is never going to
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I told the guy, Oh, my washing machine
was off balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've made up some story,
but then I realized like, I can't even use
[SPEAKER_01]: this system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to like dismantle that thing,
go to slabs, you know, and just go,
[SPEAKER_01]: just go real simple slabs with drippers,
which again, you know, with hydro,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can, you can take it to whatever level
you want as far as complications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it's, you know,
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, I've seen systems that are
amazing plants look great, but I know in
[SPEAKER_01]: my heart that when they harvest,
whoever's cleaning this thing is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: go nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's the problem with,
with, with hydroponics in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion is that your clean factor is
so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got to really keep
everything just uber clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that was, so that was sort of my
start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I realized, uh, you know,
I went and I did cocoa and cause I felt
[SPEAKER_01]: like cocoa was more closer to,
to, to soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Had more of a vibe, but then cocoa has its
own limitations also.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I feel like with, with,
um, like I've seen a lot of, like I'd say
[SPEAKER_01]: a big percentage of people grow with cocoa
in the industry and you see, and like
[SPEAKER_01]: within, you know, I'll, and I never say it
as a diss, I'm always like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: is this grown with cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, how did you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, it's because it comes
out in a certain band.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like a certain does not,
it's hard to go above a certain point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily though, the low points are
tend to be better than most.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the average guy has a cushion when
he does cocoa, you know, straight hydro,
[SPEAKER_01]: like deep water culture is also my
favorite when it comes to like mother
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to grow like, I mean,
I've seen the biggest plants ever grown
[SPEAKER_01]: have been on DWC ever like, well,
you know, besides outdoor NorCal or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, or, you know, Oregon,
but indoors, like strictly indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a system one time guy sent me a
photo from Canada from back in the early
[SPEAKER_01]: nineties and his setup was so simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blew my mind because you could tell
that this guy has run this over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: and over and over and over and over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows his parameters, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He would grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had them on a milk cartons,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had milk cartons stacked up with a
with a DWC bucket on top of each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's raised up off the ground because
the plant was perfectly round,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bottom of it was, you know,
stick like, so it was, say it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: let me see where the camera is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it was like up on two or it was up
on one milk carton with a, with a five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon bucket, and then the lowest buds
were coming right almost down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground and the top ones were hitting
almost the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these things looked like an explosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was like, wow, dude, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sent me these photos in sync and it
was like empty room and then bedroom and
[SPEAKER_01]: then full flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And between the bed, between the empty
room and the full flower room was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you couldn't even imagine that those could
be sustained by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that simple five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was because he had a separate
reservoir and another room with like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 200 gallon that fed with,
um, Texas controllers style, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the old, you know, Texas controller that,
that it's just like the, the one main unit
[SPEAKER_01]: going to the other units.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so you could, otherwise you would
never be able to do this because they
[SPEAKER_01]: would suck up all the water in five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these plants are just massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the funny part about it was he had all
these photos and then the last photo was
[SPEAKER_01]: like this humongous cop standing next to
it, like huge, like six foot seven cop
[SPEAKER_01]: standing next to the plant, like with a
big smile, like, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's so depressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I saw the first two pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, wow, this guy's doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, not so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so great at the end, but, uh,
it was a classic Canadian setup too,
[SPEAKER_01]: because what he did is he had,
he had the nine DWCs and I think he had 12
[SPEAKER_01]: lights total, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he had 12,000 Watts classic,
you know, Canadian style hanging,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No hoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nine hanging, uh, bulbs and then,
or no 12 hanging bulbs with nine light
[SPEAKER_01]: with nine plants in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was light on every side of every
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the setup was bare bone, super
simple, massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think DWC is like, you know,
when you see roots coming out of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things, sometimes you're just like,
wow, like it blows your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know that that's, if you
stretched all those roots out,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would fill the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're just compacted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've done several different
hydroponic systems in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of folks make the mistake of
thinking that hydroponics is only D to AC,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so many other systems out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the ones that you didn't
mention is, uh, flood and drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done that in the past?
[SPEAKER_01]: I not for flowering so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do that with my vegging plants a
lot of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a flood and drain table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put all my blocks on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once the roots were popping
through, I drop them onto the slabs,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or into the whatever system we
were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So flood and drain is really good for,
for that, for that type of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're, they're just going for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I felt like whenever I was,
did whenever I saw people doing flood and
[SPEAKER_01]: drain for flowering plants, you tended to
get like it, unless they were all
[SPEAKER_01]: monoculture, if they were all the same
strain, okay, then it would be easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you had a situation where you had
multiple things going on, it was very hard
[SPEAKER_01]: to like lock them in because you'd
overwater one and underwater the other
[SPEAKER_01]: ones, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they get into these, they just
have different capillary sort of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'd end up with like,
like over, like they're fine and veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in flower, I always felt like you'd,
you'd, you'd overdo it sometimes because
[SPEAKER_01]: they, they're, they're in a different
mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're, when you're young,
you can just throw whatever you want at
[SPEAKER_01]: them and they'll take it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, I feel like, uh, you know,
the idea of hydro is, is a very enticing,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially to new growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I tended to tell people was like,
you're going to learn a lot more growing
[SPEAKER_01]: in soil just because you're not so fixated
on, on fixing the system every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you come in the room, you're like,
Oh, I got a leak over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not even looking at your plants
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at the leak, you know,
and you're working on that leak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas on soil, it's sort of like,
unless it's a water situation,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the only thing you really have to
do, you come in and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, they're all drooping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to water them before I can do
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise you're not so, you know,
worried about little, little things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's a smarter,
especially from the beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: like if you're a new grower, start,
you're better off to work your way towards
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro instead of the other way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the wrong, I did the exact wrong
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went straight to the most complicated
thing possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably been like that all the
way through, you know, I still do the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to sabotage myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you when you're,
you're talking to a new grower and they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are so many different ways
to grow in hydroponics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically recommend for them
to start out in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What style?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're really, if you're a dead set on
doing it, I would say, well, actually I
[SPEAKER_01]: would go in more with cocoa just because
it kind of keeps them in that realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that the transition, when they decide
that they do not want to grow with
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics, they won't feel so like out
of their element, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, and also I feel like the formulas
that people have now for cocoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're dialed it in so much
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in the beginning, there was a lot of
issues because of the enzymes and because
[SPEAKER_01]: you didn't have the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're, if you didn't have a buffer,
the right buffers within your food,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd have a nightmare, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where, that's what turned me
off of, of cocoa down the road was because
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like I was pigeonholed into having
to work with certain, I have to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't not do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't do this, they're not going to,
you know, they're not going to thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas you felt like you had much more
range when you were just kind of working
[SPEAKER_01]: on organic side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but I do, I do think that with if,
for instance, like a kind of a,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a hybrid version of, of is sometimes
also good too, where you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're, you're giving people
like earth boxes, things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that have like a wicking system so that
you are, you're kind of in the automated
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding, but you're not quite there,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, it is definitely important that you
figure out what's comfortable for you
[SPEAKER_01]: though, because like nothing worse than
putting all your eggs, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: going into it so deep and then realizing
at a certain point, like, oh man,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've kind of wasted a lot of,
how many, I mean, how many times do you go
[SPEAKER_01]: to your friend's place and look in their,
in their garage and see like the remnants
[SPEAKER_01]: of all the grow systems that didn't make
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like my, I have a graveyard of,
of things at my spot right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these ways can be easier than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was talking about beginner mistakes
real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I've seen DWC systems where
people try to be sort of hands off with it
[SPEAKER_00]: and they go ahead and all of a sudden
their EC is, is skyrockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feed too high of EC and their punts
are dead overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it can be a little bit more
risky than some of the other methods of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in organics as transition to that now,
there's so many different ways you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: organics as well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your own soil mix and then
feed in blends, organic blends from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do individual amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could buy bagged organic potting mix
and then go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your style of organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how do you approach organic
gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, I'm lucky enough to live on a
farm, so I have the ability to kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, work with what's there and also,
um, you know, if you're, if you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's the thing is with hydro,
it makes sense sometimes because like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, you're living in a place where you
can't bring soil in and out and not look
[SPEAKER_01]: like complete nutcase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are they doing in this nice
house coming into this field?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so there's always reasons for
everything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and with me with, with organic,
like, so I, I, um, uh, I, right now I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: doing, uh, three by three, uh,
uh, cloth pots, the square ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like to grow with large,
uh, large containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's, that's like when I see people
growing on soil, but they're doing them in
[SPEAKER_01]: one gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or three gallons or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're feeding them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, at that point, you're hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You might as well grow hydro at that point
because you are feeding them every single
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it's like about a two,
two day with a dry back kind of feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule is about right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I try not to, like, I don't want to have
to, I don't want to have to go down there
[SPEAKER_01]: every day, but also don't, I like to hand
feed everything just because it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the numbers are not very,
you know, if it was a large scale grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course that you're going to automate as
much as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're dealing with personal size
gardens, I think it's super important that
[SPEAKER_01]: you do hand water if possible,
because it really connects you to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can, you know, you pick up the
pot, you check the weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's in a pot or if it's in a,
if it's in a three by three, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you know, you've given it a couple of
days, you see a little bit of droop,
[SPEAKER_01]: you come in, you feed, but I really feel
like the hand watering connects you,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to your garden a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it is really like important that you
pay attention obviously to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm always counting in my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all I'm doing is walking around and
counting every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything like counting, you know,
like, okay, this one check the weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, and they kind of know in
your head, that's 30 seconds there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this was, and then, so I'm just
constantly walking around and poking and
[SPEAKER_01]: prodding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like it's, um, one of those
things where you, like, I really don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like when people feed like on a schedule,
whenever they feel like it, like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really the plants, it's up to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, if I go in and, and this one over
here has not been feeding very much,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I'm not going to give it anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let it dry out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've seen many people who it just
becomes like a system where they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: like, doesn't matter, you know,
whatever you didn't eat too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you get more, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you'll see, you know,
you can track those plants down the road
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'll see though, they will not,
uh, live up to the, to the ones next to
[SPEAKER_01]: them because they just, you know,
they need a, they need a break for a day
[SPEAKER_01]: or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think, um, for me, like organic
equals that idea of hand watering and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, slow, slow pace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not trying to the minute you want to set
it all up and forget about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you, you need to think about
Hydra at that point, because that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the kind of person, you know,
if you want to set it up on your phone and
[SPEAKER_01]: be all high tech and, you know,
check all your stuff, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, but a lot of times for me,
it's like, it's a lot like, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to work on boats, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to sail on boats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times, like when you run a
small boat, you do everything by hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to like go in there and adjust,
adjust the trim on the, on the sail,
[SPEAKER_01]: run back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but if you're on a bigger boat,
everything's automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just boop, boop, you hit a button,
boop, boop, boop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, I like the idea of running
around and doing adjusting things because
[SPEAKER_01]: it keeps me in the, in the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also makes me like, no,
like, I know when I'm going to bed,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh, I got to go back and check that
because it's like, you're, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: connected to your garden more.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minute you like have it all on your
computer or it's on your phone or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you're waiting for your phone
to tell you if your plants are not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you shouldn't, you don't,
you lost the, you lost your little heart
[SPEAKER_01]: connection to your plants at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you're like, Oh, it'll take care of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, Oh shit, my phone's dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like things, you know, too late,
too little, too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we've all left the, uh,
reservoir running and ran up to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody rang on the doorbell and you
forgot and you went and started doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then had that that heart drop moment
where you're like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've done it more than most I'd say,
but still makes you feel, it makes you
[SPEAKER_01]: laugh at yourself though, sometimes,
which is always a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're like, I can't believe I just
did that again.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to like the fertilizer,
uh, do you typically do like the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: blends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do individual amendments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do compost or worm castings?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little of the, I'm a kind of a
little guilty of all of the above in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sense of, I usually will, I'll re-amend
all my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like because I'm doing a three by threes,
I will, and I'm, you know, I I've played
[SPEAKER_01]: around with no till I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is, is that I'm also,
um, nervous about any kind of pathogens or
[SPEAKER_01]: any kind of problems kind of kicking in
and having to like, you know, like once
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a soil that you've dedicated
years into it, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it becomes super critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that you can keep it, maintain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I also have sponsors from the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got like, you know, bio three,
six, five soil I've got access to all
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, well, you know, in an ideal
world, of course I would, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: be living on my farm, reamending my stuff
and keeping it all biodynamic and within
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual confines of the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have people dropping off
pallets of soil to you, you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: eh, probably going to use soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not going to go out and make
my own soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I have people delivering me
beautifully made, uh, products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm doing a lot of testing,
which makes it harder to kind of maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: one system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so like, um, for instance,
uh, what I'll usually do is I'll have all
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh soil on my smaller runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually I'll take all that
soil and put it outside and then reamend
[SPEAKER_01]: it and then bring it back into an end and
use it in a different, different part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so every, it's a beautiful
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got chickens and we got, you know,
we got cows and chickens and horses and
[SPEAKER_01]: things on the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a constant, constant flow,
which is a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I love the idea of,
and that's why I feel like if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: situation like that, then you,
if you're not growing organically,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'd be crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, if you literally have the
ability to, you know, take all your scraps
[SPEAKER_01]: and feed them to your chickens and they're
happy, you're happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's happy at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, I also work with,
um, with cultured biologics who is also,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Tim was on your show recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, you know how, I mean,
you talk about a wealth of knowledge,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when you get somebody like that
super passionate and I'm testing out their
[SPEAKER_01]: products and I'm like blown away by the
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, his, anybody who's listening to
this, if you have, go back and listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: the show with Tim, you will realize,
I'm sure how incredibly intelligent he is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also passionate and his, his material,
the quality of the products coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: his thing is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've, I've night and day,
like I literally, and it's powdered,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Eon line, at least, I mean,
he's got new stuff coming out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the Eon line, which is what I've been
running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it is, it really feels like
you're, you're, uh, treating your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: super special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you, you feed them,
you're just like, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like his supplements,
his liquid supplements, nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's got a nitrogen phosphorous,
um, and he's got like some saponins and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all those products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe every time I hit them up
with it, you know, you get that extra
[SPEAKER_01]: special feeling when you walk back in and
everything is praying, like amazing and
[SPEAKER_01]: just, yeah, the, the amount of growth that
comes off those, his nitrogen one,
[SPEAKER_01]: I dropped one recently and it really
smells, it doesn't smell bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a really weird smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got like a smell of like a locker
room, like kind of like high school locker
[SPEAKER_01]: room funk, which is, you know,
if you know it, you know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can, it is like, it's a weird,
but it's like, uh, yeah, it's just this
[SPEAKER_01]: weird, weird vibe, but it's, but oh my
God, the plants, they just go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a ability to work with a lot of
cool products, which makes it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, my curse is that I'm always changing
my stuff up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my mom goes nuts, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom grows with me and she is,
she'd be such a better grower without me
[SPEAKER_01]: around because she's so consistent with
her stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like she's just, you know, can just
consistently nails it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, she's, her dad was the grandfather
with the garden, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So she pretty much just has it in her,
in her system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she never, like, like every time
there's a fuck up, it's because I try to
[SPEAKER_01]: do something like, Hey, then she'll come
in and what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was, Oh, I was just trying
this new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, and so, so I, my,
my probably my guilt, my, my worst thing
[SPEAKER_01]: about growing from my personal point of
view is that I'm always trying new things,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I mean, I feel like it's part of the
nature of the beast, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you always want to improve on things,
but, and it's a little bit like fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I look at photos from five years ago,
I'm like, what was I doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what the hell was I doing there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why am I playing so dark?
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't have any way I'm away
overfeeding them here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, I'm always critiquing all my old
stuff and it's amazing how each time you
[SPEAKER_01]: do something, you feel like it's the best
you've ever done or sometime, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and there's no more room for
improvement, but then lo and behold,
[SPEAKER_01]: you look back a year later and you're
like, Oh, there was so much room for
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to the whole concentrate game and
all the different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the evolution of things and how
quickly they, they go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, if you look at a photo
again from like 10 years ago, you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like couldn't even identify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think it's a, it's a,
it's, it's nice to, to try different
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you know,
if you can lock in on something that works
[SPEAKER_01]: for you, good, good, good rule is to
continue that same thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you will improve on it or just be
like me and always try something
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like you where I'm always doing
something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, uh, some of my viewers have
complained because they, they watch my
[SPEAKER_00]: videos and they're like, Hey, you're not
still doing that method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something wrong with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, I'm just trying something
new.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different ways to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to organics, I was growing,
uh, I was using the earth dust nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: by the green sunshine company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went out of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craft blend by build a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm using a kiss nutrients,
pack, uh, kiss organics, nutrient pack,
[SPEAKER_00]: but man, you're making me want to try,
uh, Tim's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Tim's is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know who else is also amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've had them on the show
before is a dragon fly earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had them on yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you need to have them on yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're up in Canada and they
have a complete biodynamic formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: Duke uses a lot of their stuff and I'm
just there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're one of the ones in the group,
like I'd say out of all the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the industry, they're like 100%
doing it the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like there's no, no,
no, uh, they do not skimp on anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like not a single input that's in any of
their products is not, or does not a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred percent certified organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they, there is no like, Oh,
well we're not a hundred percent sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, even if like product that went
into the compost possibly wasn't organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't need, they don't, they don't
touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's amazing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some, you know, that's the
thing with, with, I think, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: people tend to always think that it's like
one extreme or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I really feel like a kind
of a combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of everything is what kind of works for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you notice like companies like
veganics, right back in the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, everybody thought, if you look
at it, go look into that reliable and look
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not vegan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not vegan.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not, there is, there is 2%,
maybe 3% non-organics, you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to be extreme, you have to
be like dragon fire earth medicine and do
[SPEAKER_01]: it real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's can't really bottle organics and,
and truly have a proper product because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like that, that 2% is probably the
most important 2%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's what's really making it do
its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, organic has its place,
but it has to be very, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to, you also have to be a little
bit like forgiving on some things too,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I feel like you want to give the
plant the best things it can get,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and not limit itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you definitely should try.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely need to try the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you also doing some of the,
I like to call optional methods,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like cover crop, crops,
mulch layers, things that aren't really
[SPEAKER_00]: required when growing organically,
but people do it as well in order to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a better result.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's benefits to doing those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do like, um, cover crops,
mostly because I feel like it helps the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, um, not dry out too quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise you get that dusty top zone
where you just feel like there's not much
[SPEAKER_01]: life in the top two inches, you know,
and that's really where you want more
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiverse biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, um, you know, I'll, I'll tend to
grow clover, and barley and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes in, in between, like a lot
of times if I'm not like, if there's any,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, like when I'm finished with the crop,
I'll just throw a bunch of seeds in there
[SPEAKER_01]: just to keep the life rolling in that
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't get all dead on,
you know, so, but I won't do it as like,
[SPEAKER_01]: as like, that is my only nutrients are
the, you know, go in there and cut all the
[SPEAKER_01]: things down and let it go back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm still, I'm still, you know,
coming from the world of just,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see some action, you know,
let's see some action go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we're talking about hydroponics
versus growing organics, there's a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of things that are kind of controversy,
which would be yield and then flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you personally notice a difference in
yield when growing organically versus
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponically?
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, the thing about growing on hydro
is you do, you do achieve sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing results when it comes to yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you are basically, you know,
um, fog warring these things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're forced feeding them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're giving them whatever, you know,
you're maxing them out on their EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're pushing the plants to its limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I've seen massive plants,
especially recently too, cause like I go
[SPEAKER_01]: and tour all these gardens and you know,
it's, it's, it's beautiful to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I also know that there's PGRs in there
and I'm not really interested in smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: any of it because I don't feel it's
healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I see some phenomenal growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's some amazing results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yields tend to, uh, suffer a little
bit in, in, in organic, not, not all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time though.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certain situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on your location and
your, in whatever your inputs are because
[SPEAKER_01]: organic growing, for instance,
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's no, I wouldn't even compare
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you never going to get a salty
plant to grow as big as an organic plant
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors and a large scale just because
it, it won't, it will not, there's nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: to sustain it to that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, you know, when you're growing
organically outdoors on a scale like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: just the amount of assistance that's going
on within the mycorrhizal and the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizospheres is a completely active place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you go into hydro, the
rhizosphere is a devoid of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, there's things going,
there's roots growing, but there's hardly
[SPEAKER_01]: any, you know, uh, life down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, the, the key to the whole
thing is, is everything helps each other.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing, uh, so like,
but flavor, but then on the opposite end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the spectrum, when it comes to flavor,
hands down, a hundred percent organic
[SPEAKER_01]: every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no, not even a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and people can say, oh yeah,
I get, I can grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people can't tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure you can, but I bet if somebody else
grew it organically, it would taste better
[SPEAKER_01]: than what you, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, it really comes down to
like, you cannot compare them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, the cardboard turps you
get off of Athena is not going to ever
[SPEAKER_01]: compare to a, you know, a properly grown
organic garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just it ain't happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and people can, cause a lot of
times people will be like, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not from experience only from,
you know, they smoked that they think it
[SPEAKER_01]: tastes good, but they don't know what else
could be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much more that can be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, definitely from a, from an
actual wanting to smoke your point of
[SPEAKER_01]: view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had, um, we did a thing called the
ADSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the Adam Dunn Show Invitational.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did him in 2014, 15, 18, and every
single time top three organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all blind and this is by the
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, we did the classic where
if you enter, you get to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't like, you know, randos,
it was like you entered or you entered
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro, but you picked organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore that just tells me it wins
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the growers themselves see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think you can't really beat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about bud structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard people, some people say the bud
structure is compromised when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing with hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, they, they, uh, have grown
the same cultivar, same cut and organic
[SPEAKER_00]: versus hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've gotten more denser bud
structure and the organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hydroponics, it's more airier,
fluffier bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I think that's true too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it comes down to genetics a little
bit there though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes you'll have certain ones that
just respond better to the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, the thing about hydro is
it's a lot of water weight, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got this like massive,
you know, expansion and large watery
[SPEAKER_01]: cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it's very similar to like,
and then if you take organic growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like the cell structure is tighter,
you know, the cell walls are thicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you take a cell wall, that's
thicker and you dry it out and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: more mass, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Theoretically and it's, and it's denser so
you don't get this big expansion and then
[SPEAKER_01]: retraction, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that like big bud, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was so, uh, in Holland,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the Dutch are very, um,
they're very money oriented.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not so flower orientated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love their money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's flowers for the Kuchenhoff or if
it's, you know, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all that the Dutch really care
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where that's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans who go, they really shine when
it came to breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we really were about flavors and
about all these things that they weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were only about size, smell and
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of, that's their, that's their
goal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How big is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it smell like?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much money can I get?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were more like, you know,
how does it smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it taste?
[SPEAKER_01]: And does the joint even burn?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that would be the other thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get people just pack them up with food
and don't really flush it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you end up with some terribly burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, the, uh, but what I also
noticed too, and you, you, as you go
[SPEAKER_01]: higher up in altitude, you know,
you, your plants change too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the things where I
almost compare like a high altitude plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to a organic growing plant and a Valley,
like a low Valley plant to a hydro plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the low Valley plant gets a lot of
water, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Grows really tall and thin and kind of
massive biomassy kind of situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you go up into the mountains,
the same genetics would be short and more
[SPEAKER_01]: compact to insulate them better and also
to be more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the UV increases, as you go higher
up in the UV increases, it, it shortens
[SPEAKER_01]: everything down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so if you go to the top of a
mountain and see the trees at the top,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're a lot shorter and tighter and more
compact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you go down the mountain,
it gets bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get to the bottom,
they're really big and just water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like similar in the sense
that you get this density issue and that
[SPEAKER_01]: density is what I believe is the part that
you're saying as far as like, cause I've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen a lot of plants grown in Hydra,
which, you know, they look, they fill up
[SPEAKER_01]: the area, but you can just see that
there's not much there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they have this, especially all the
Cali strains, all these new Cali strains
[SPEAKER_01]: are really lame.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to say they're really lame to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow them and you're like,
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they don't ever explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they don't have that vigor that
you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like it's almost like all of us
old time growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were always going back to the nineties,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the nineties, big giant Williams
wonder, but you know, we had like,
[SPEAKER_01]: because everything counted, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was like, you get one shot,
you know, you get one shot kid,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you got to get it and make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas now the pressure is off as far as
like, you know, you're running a licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, there's no pressure beyond
doing the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's funny is that because of that,
people gotten a lot less focused on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like the, all of the above
strains that you want, which is like good
[SPEAKER_01]: yields are good strength and power and
does all the things you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just go in for like the one,
all they're going for is extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much like, that's how
people's brains are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like whatever they, they take it,
does it wash well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When somebody asks me is, does it wash
well?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm usually like go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like really, that's all you care about is
washing the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even care about the plant
because the plants that wash well are not
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants that smoke well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants that smoke well tend to be,
you know, individual, nice buds that are
[SPEAKER_01]: really like get a chance to mature
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not always like runny little
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but the ones that are runny or the
ones that are loose, they're really good
[SPEAKER_01]: for making extracts, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're like, you don't want to like,
like your really good flower plant that's
[SPEAKER_01]: got nice, compact, beautiful buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hard to get into to make the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time you get into them,
you've tore them all up and now you've
[SPEAKER_01]: created more, you know, just more
chlorophyll in the system or more plant
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you get a plants that are,
you know, like just easy, there are lots
[SPEAKER_01]: of, lots of trikes on both sides and it's
easy to get to, knock it all off really
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your hand paddling, you know, everybody's
doing it by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't want stuff that you have to
break it up, you know, and if you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: break it up, you're causing more,
you know, quality control issues at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think, I think definitely,
and also the other thing too, the number
[SPEAKER_01]: one thing I see problems with is pH on
Hydro systems, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll walk in and I'll be like,
Oh, you got a pH problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be like, Oh, what are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know, dude, you got a pH problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you right now, look at
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all single leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all like looking really stressed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the problem with Hydro is that,
you know, you're creating all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: boundaries and therefore there's a huge
chance of messing all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you are a human and you are not
like the plants have no problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you give them everything they need,
they'll figure it out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll take it in as they need to
take it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're doing Hydro, you don't
give them a chance because they only have
[SPEAKER_01]: a very limited window to feed,
which is like when the timer kicks on,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the timer kicks on, they're feeding,
they get a little bit of remnants at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's just drying out and,
you know, hopefully expanding roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, when it's on soil or what's on,
you know, organically, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of like a, they have a,
uh, they have a smorgasbord set up in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of them, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're like, Oh, I want one of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me have some of that, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, the mycorrhizaeal
and other things are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting it ready for the plants and
setting it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they come in and scoop up that,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot more, there's a lot more
going on that we don't get and you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: never get because it's, you know,
at a microbial level and it's not like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not your decision to make,
you know, it's so, so yeah, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, most of the mistakes would probably be
human error, you know, on Hydro,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, you know, something we can
avoid, but with with organic, you kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you just kind of try to create the,
the environment for them to do their
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely want to get into cost
perspective here, but there are folks that
[SPEAKER_00]: are on a budget, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they don't want to be spending
hundreds or potentially even thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars, depending on how big they're,
they set up, they want to have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a cost perspective, talk to us
about Hydro versus organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by far, obviously, um, organic would be
cheaper to get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now when you start talking about cost
per pound and on industrial levels and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that, um, after the initial
input, because the thing about Hydro is
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to buy the system, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you buy the system and then a lot of
people that are like, yeah, but I bought
[SPEAKER_01]: it once and I can just reuse it over and
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that in their mind is their cost saving
factor, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still inputs, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You still got your cocoa or your rock wall
or whatever medium that you, unless you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like DWC would probably be the cheapest
format of going into it because you really
[SPEAKER_01]: only have to buy that cocoa block each
time or that rock wall block each time to
[SPEAKER_01]: put on top for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, whereas, you know, with, and,
and so really it comes down to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, from a beginner point of view,
costs are kind of negligible because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not talking about a big system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might cost a little bit more for
Hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the, at the end of the day,
like if they were to take their costs per
[SPEAKER_01]: gram or whatever, it would would end up,
uh, being cheaper on organic in the long
[SPEAKER_01]: run, but in the short run, because,
uh, you can sort of like say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent $27 and I may, and I got a pound,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty good ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, whereas a lot of times with organic
stuff, uh, you know, the, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the initial costs, depending on what
you're doing, I mean, if you go to build a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil was another sponsor of my show and
he's got every range possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can spend a quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also spend quite a lot of money
on, on, on organic stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really depends on, on what you want
to do, but you can also go, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: like those guys at dragon fly earth
medicine, they quoted me at $5 a pound for
[SPEAKER_01]: their organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what their costs are, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So five bucks a pound is pretty damn
cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you're going to get much
cheaper than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because of course they're on,
you know, they're using everything within
[SPEAKER_01]: their farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're very rarely putting much more
inputs in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Took them a long time to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure there was, you know,
initial costs all the way along,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, you, you definitely can grow
cheaper if you live in the right place
[SPEAKER_01]: organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you don't live in the right place,
it's not going to make much sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, you're going to grow,
especially if you're doing anything
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse or outdoor, anything large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, you know, when you start thinking
about, I mean, I've seen people do it like
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics outdoors, you're like,
what is wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, what are you doing over here?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't, I mean, really going against
the grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: As hard as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a small scale, I think cost
effective wise, organic, a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_01]: cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, when you're growing
on scale to like for large licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: producers and stuff, they're going to look
at it like the, they're going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: better time with hydroponics because it's
easier for them to calculate the inputs
[SPEAKER_01]: and the outputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a very simple formula that
keeps repeating itself over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's kind of my, my way of
looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be super cheap organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a closed loop operation,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is kind of what you were explaining
that that farm has, which is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: they're, they're using their own inputs
that they're creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can even go down the natural
farming route, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the, the fermented plant juice,
fermented fruit juice, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets really, really cheap then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's actually, it's one of
the, the latest advancements in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in, in a agriculture that is even though
it's ancient technologies, the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's tuned in on it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, maybe like four years ago
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the first time I even like
ran across ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friend had them in his garden and I
was like, what's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, oh, I made that out of peaches
and I made this one out of mangoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, didn't really like,
I mean, his gardens were nice,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it wasn't like, I wasn't like,
oh my God, blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then later flavor wise, I started to
like, you know, he gave me some from that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that round.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, man, this stuff,
amazing taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so I started to gravitate
towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now of course, miles is,
is making some awesome ferments and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, teaching everybody how to do,
which is really important too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the one thing if,
because we have access to all these like
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh new material, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like turning into ferments and makes
so much sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you can make ferments from
your own plants and then reintroduce it
[SPEAKER_01]: into your own garden, it's like,
you know, it's the difference between
[SPEAKER_01]: working with, you know, local compared to
like importing in every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause when you import stuff in,
everything has to establish itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have local, you know,
you have local inputs, it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it gives you that much of a head start and
everything's like, you know, that
[SPEAKER_01]: everything can survive because that's
where it comes from, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have yet to try some of these natural
farming techniques, you know, the
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented plant juice, fermented fruit
juice, but you know, it really is my goal
[SPEAKER_00]: to like not spend any money on organic
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could spend no money on fertilizer in
the future, that's, that would be a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: win.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not there yet, but maybe I'll get
there in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also like, you know, worms having
your own little worm bin going is always a
[SPEAKER_01]: good move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't let them dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my problem out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You come back, you're all sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just lost hundreds of worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, worms are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get them in your garden,
that's, that's a huge bonus right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the worm bin going and yeah,
so I'm working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting there, but I feel like at the
end of the day, you know, when it talks
[SPEAKER_00]: about hydro versus organic, I have some
people ask me what's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the follow-up question should always
be what's better for what, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking to make things easy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you looking to grow plants fast?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to go on one team or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go team organic just because of my
feelings of, of a consumer, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like if it was, if it was a producing
situation and that's all you cared about
[SPEAKER_01]: was numbers and production, I can,
I can understand when people might want to
[SPEAKER_01]: go down that road, but if you're,
if you're doing it for yourself and you
[SPEAKER_01]: are the recipient of all of this material,
you're doing yourself no favors by,
[SPEAKER_01]: by limiting your organic and like being in
going with, with a hydro system,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you really, at the end of the day,
like when it comes to food or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm putting in my body, I really want
to focus on, you know, having an organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather spend the extra money to have
organic than, than try to cut corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like with, with anything that
you're consuming on a daily, you should
[SPEAKER_01]: think that way because there will be a
reckoning at some point, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you figure out down the road,
like, wow, been smoking all this PGR might
[SPEAKER_01]: look really good, but it's not good for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you it's a hundred percent not
good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you can really see the
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were saying earlier about the,
you know, natural like organic compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to, um, uh, hydro, really it's the PGRs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the number one issue right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the problem with most of the,
or get most of the hydro formulas,
[SPEAKER_01]: unless they specifically tell you that
they're not in there, they probably are in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like, it's almost like if you,
uh, if you want to get corn products,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't say it's organic,
you can guarantee it's GMO and it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: grown with roundup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you probably don't want to consume it
at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always feel like with anything
like that, you really, you're better off
[SPEAKER_01]: to, uh, take the slow road and,
and have a quality product at the end that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can feel is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we could get deeper and deeper into
both aspects, but we're going to wrap
[SPEAKER_00]: things up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I, you know what I'm going
to do now though, is I'm going to invite
[SPEAKER_01]: you to my show and then you can go nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be Mr. Grove.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've always wanted to be, I'm swearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but definitely come on the show
sometime and hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell the listeners where they can find you
and, uh, what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, uh, every Friday we're about to
do a show in a few hours now, but it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, every Friday, four 20 to seven 10
mountain time, three hour show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we do, uh, you know, we have lots of
interesting guests, but we also,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we, we're not strictly a grow
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day it could be, you know,
building materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next day it could be CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next day it could be THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next day, you know, it could be
anything, any above of all different
[SPEAKER_01]: subjects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes it great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it could be Hemcrete one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but we have, uh, yeah, we've had,
we've had some great guests this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, so far we've only,
we're only in February and we've had,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Ed on here and Rosenthal on here
and Tommy Chong and all the big,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the big hitters come on every so
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and, but our show is very much
like a, uh, a hangout, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's a little bit less of a tell you
what to do more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just come hang out with us and enjoy your
Fridays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to come on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the invite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Adam, this has, uh, it's been a fun
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to hear your, your perspective on
organics and hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely learned a lot of things about
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you've been doing this for a
very, very long time.
