[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know,
my name is Chris, aka MrGrowIt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I actually just got done livestreaming
on Twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recorded a Q&A video, which is what
you're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to ask me questions,
the best way to do it is on Twitch during
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the livestreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow me on Twitch, twitch.tv,
slash MrGrowIt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure notifications are on,
and then you'll get notified when I go
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can come hang out in the chat,
live, and ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of great questions this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wine fridge won't set at 60 degrees,
only 54.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be okay to store my jarred bud
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, some people do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be mixed opinions on what
the optimal storage temperature is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've heard as low as 40 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people, typical
refrigerator is around 40 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I've been testing this the other
day, is I put a temperature and humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor inside my fridge just to see what
it looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ranged between 32 and a half to 40
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit is kind of what my fridge range
is at, just random times opening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, fridge turns on and off as
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just store theirs right in the
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: 54 should be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to say 60 is the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going to say 68 is the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: One company in particular is the Canada
Troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a Canada Troll back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome unit they have there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say 68, according to their studies,
is the ideal storage temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once they came out and said that,
that was a whole bunch of backlash,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I word this without calling it bro
science?
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, it's more anecdotal evidence
of 60 degrees being the ideal storage
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are the studies?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there are any.
[SPEAKER_00]: So correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post a link in the description if there's
a study saying that 60 degree Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_00]: is the most optimal for whatever reason,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, 54 degrees should be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pretty much answers your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Grote asks, what's the best complete
grow tank kits on the market today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm glad you asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Happy Hydro honestly does make the
best grow tank kits on the market today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're a sponsor of this Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have simple beginner kits with
everything you need, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to add water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does include the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they use Soham.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living soil comes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Complete grow tank kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also have complete grow tank kits
with automatic watering systems like blue
[SPEAKER_00]: mats, for example, auto pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if there's any other kits
on the market that's actually offering
[SPEAKER_00]: that level of complete grow tank kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them are built with AC and infinity
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So top of the line stuff, especially with
their automation that they have with their
[SPEAKER_00]: inline fans, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked out with a deal with them is they
include my book in the kits as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm super thankful for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to Happy
Hydro's complete grow tank kits down in
[SPEAKER_00]: the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually use coupon code
GROWKIT for 10% off.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you keep your lung room well
ventilated?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now my lung room is really my
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have two grow tents within that
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a spare bedroom, not the one I'm
currently sleeping in or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's a nine by 12 or it's a 10
by 12 room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I've got a two foot by four
foot grow tent in there and then a four
[SPEAKER_00]: foot by four foot grow tent in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have it on a passive intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that I have an exhaust fan
pulling air out of the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then air is just passively coming in
through the bottom rectangle intake vents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So air is coming in from my lung room into
the grow tents as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have it hooked up to an AC infinity
fan and it comes on according to the
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the heat is too high, 82 degrees is
kind of what I have it set at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most times it'll kick on and it'll
start exhausting some of that hot air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have it venting out of the room into
my attic and then out of the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That air needs to obviously be pulled from
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's being pulled from the lung room
and the air from the lung room is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in from underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I actually cut a hole in the bedroom
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say it's a nine inch by 10 inch
hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: For ventilation, the bottom of your door,
there's obviously a space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Air can get in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people, they'll just,
air will come in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, me, I want to keep my lung room
dark at all times because having those
[SPEAKER_00]: rectangle vents open on the grow tents,
if there's light shining into the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the door that could interrupt the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually have a cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like something that slides under the
door, two pieces of basically styrofoam
[SPEAKER_00]: and fabric that slides on the door and
blocks the light out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I cut the rectangle vent on the
door and then I have some cardboard kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of covering a little bit to point it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light isn't coming in through that way
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I gave you a long-winded answer
here, but it's just coming in that way
[SPEAKER_00]: through the vented door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air is coming in as it's being pulled out
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get my tent to not get sucked in
without having light coming in?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a common problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is people will open up those bottom
rectangle vents and they will,
[SPEAKER_00]: the light will be coming in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause their lung room, whatever room that
they have the grow tent is, is lit or is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lit at times when it doesn't need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what some people do in order to kind of
get around that, is they'll cover those
[SPEAKER_00]: rectangle vents, but they'll open up the
ventilation sock where your round ducting
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out of towards the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will put it down there and
they'll have a kind of wrap around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll also put some sort of
screening mesh screening on the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way, as the things wrap it around,
you're preventing the light from getting
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of one way to prevent the
tent from getting sucked in on all the
[SPEAKER_00]: sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand what you mean by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then preventing the light from coming
in as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you chop your cover crew?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like to plant the cover crop and
then plant the plant shortly after,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that way, as the plant is starting
to grow, maybe it's a seedling and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops coming up, but I kind of,
my rule is I make sure that the cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't overgrowing the actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I'm cutting it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now this plant grows and it's bigger
plant, maybe early veg or light veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of covers the entire grow pot
where the cover crop is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really have much need to cut it
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going too long, it's kind of
subjective to say what is too long or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could cut it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, I don't really need
to cut it back much when my plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: larger and kind of already overgrown that
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just the way I go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are PK boosters worth the money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can a plant use all that PK in one go?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best way to utilize those extra
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your nutrient regimen to
begin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use Fox Farm nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a trio and I used to always run
into, well, not always, but often I would
[SPEAKER_00]: run into phosphorus deficiency in the
middle of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly see the signs of phosphorus
deficiency towards the bottom of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: starting and using a PK booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, I used Beastie Blooms by Fox
Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helped out tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was weeks three, four and five
that they recommend to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't quote me on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll tell you on the back of which prime
weeks of flowering to use it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth it to add it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're not seeing like a
phosphorus deficiency or potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency in flowering, is it okay to
just add it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me to really give you the
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you'll need to add it or no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're, when you're increasing the
phosphorus and potassium, it's needed and
[SPEAKER_00]: it can definitely help with overall blood
development, but it really depends on your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to give you kind of that
blanket answer that's going to apply to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could design a semi or fully
automatic system, what would you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: automate and what would you want to be
manual?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like this one because it's been
becoming more and more automated over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly with AC Infinity,
I feel like they're leading the pack when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, once their fan came out,
that inline fan, pretty much a game
[SPEAKER_00]: changer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have set points for that fan to
automatically turn on and off for
[SPEAKER_00]: different temperatures, humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's controllers that you can hook
up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their controller now is so automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can add it to humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add an oscillating fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of to answer your question,
I'd love to have almost my entire grill
[SPEAKER_00]: automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with the AC if any equipment,
just to kind of a quick rundown of my
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, I'm using the AC Infinity grow
tents in my full by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a six inch AC Infinity inline fan
currently have two, but I might be adding
[SPEAKER_00]: two more clip on oscillating fans and also
have their humidifier in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their humidifier is freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it so much more than any other
humidifier I've ever used.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does so well increasing the humidity in
the grow space and keeping it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when I have my inline fan coming on
and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, being able to have the
automation for temperature, humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really care for the automation of
the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really looking to maximize the
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand the benefits of adding in
CO2, but it's not something that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do be just growing small plants
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to plug in the fans and the
humidifier and then being able to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: my phone and having that all automated
through my phone, which all that is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the case right now with the AC
Infinity controller 69 Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know all the differences
between the controller 69 versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: controller 69.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pro versus the Wi-Fi edition, Bluetooth
edition, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure what varies between those,
but all that's automated right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then automation as far as the blue
mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the blue mat system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to automatically water,
whether I'm doing organics and just top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing and then having just water drip
down onto the plants and keeping that
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal moisture level at all times
throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I have nutrients in the reservoir
and it's dripping down nutrients onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, automating that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally am a fan of automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of my design right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as future automations, I don't have
my lighting, my AC Infinity lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: hooked up to my controller yet,
but I need to do that because that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it would be really helpful too to
control your equipment when you're away,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if there's an emergency and I'm
away, well then I can turn off my lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and turn off my fans, turn off my grown
equipment from my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally love all that automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long winded answer on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full review of the Canada Troll soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I released a quick video on them not too
long ago and they got flooded with sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on back order for like three,
four weeks now because their sales went up
[SPEAKER_00]: so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've asked me to hold off on the review
until they they're doing some like website
[SPEAKER_00]: changes or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to make sure everything's good
to go before I release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started doing like a script on it and
kind of writing bullet points of pros and
[SPEAKER_00]: cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a paid review, so I get to say
whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I am going to say some negative
things about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I never really understood
is how people can accept money for paid
[SPEAKER_00]: reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of that, but but yeah,
it's coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully middle of April.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want it to be like the best review
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to go over like a ton of
details.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll probably be pretty long too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't they're not giving out any
discount codes to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that page where I'm giving you if they
have any sales, it'll show on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also that page shows like multiple
unit discounts as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to that page, I'd greatly
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, if you order now,
it's going to be a month to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like everybody that has one loves
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, they're complaining about the
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Price is really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got sticker shock when I first saw that
the price is kind of the biggest gripe
[SPEAKER_00]: from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're comparing it to like a wine
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're comparing it to like those egg
incubators, which I'm trying to find
[SPEAKER_00]: comparisons and no mini fridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have like the humidity control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't fully understand why people are
trying to compare them to wine fridges,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe just for storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the controls are drying too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's probably the biggest
benefit of it is being able to dry in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, I won't ramble on more about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue on with the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: BK or McDonald's for the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you know, I got to give it to BK and
I know I'm going to get roasted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this because there are a lot of
people who don't like BK.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have terrible service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but I really prefer both their
burgers and fries over McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of almost a boycott of McDonald's,
but like I try not to get McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a New Year's resolution of
mine is to not have McDonald's at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout the year, you know,
for health reasons or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I like McDonald's Big Macs are good,
but I got to I got to give that one to BK.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: BK or McDonald's?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's going to be pretty split
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in favor of McDonald's or maybe in
favor of BK.
BK or McDonald's?
