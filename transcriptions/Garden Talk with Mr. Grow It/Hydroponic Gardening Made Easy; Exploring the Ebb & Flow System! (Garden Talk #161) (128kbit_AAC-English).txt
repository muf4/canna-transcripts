[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 161.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Matt from

[SPEAKER_01]: such as the history of the plant,
latest research, gardening advice and
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this podcast episode, he talks about
how he grows his plants in an ebb and flow
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic system, everything from how the
system works, nutrients, pH, PPM,
[SPEAKER_01]: environment and more.

from Strange Show.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on the show,
honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super excited to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually met in MJ BizCon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I could say about that,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vibes were right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to really link up with people
and be on the same level as far as things
[SPEAKER_01]: that you could talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have growing in common.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the plant that we all know and
love.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have that in common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just good vibes all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to have someone that not only has
those two things in common, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: making the YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rare that I talk to someone who
also makes YouTube videos, so that was
[SPEAKER_00]: very cool to link up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, content creation, it's its own
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's like you're talking in a
different language and you're talking to
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who doesn't have experience with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, happy to have you on the podcast
today to talk about gardening,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a very successful channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's over 300,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations on that, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it takes a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a little while, but we got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make content not only on growing,
but on the consumption side of things as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very informative videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like your history ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had one on skunk number one and a
couple other strains and really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody hasn't checked out his
channel, I'll definitely have it linked in
[SPEAKER_01]: the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, I've been into these plants that
we like so much for a long time since I
[SPEAKER_00]: was young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I used to read about all kinds
of cool growing techniques and gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: magazines, but I never really got into
growing much back then just because the
[SPEAKER_00]: laws weren't very favorable in my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in like 2017 is when I moved to
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not long after living in Colorado,
I got a job in a big commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that for a few years working in the
harvest side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a few big harvest crews.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would go around to a lot of different
grow facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that job was really cool because I got
to experience a lot of different grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities just from one job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I eventually moved to the cultivation side
of the commercial grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, when I moved out of my
tiny apartment, I was like, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm living in Denver now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start growing at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that really all started in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about your grow style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you indoors, outdoors, soil,
cocoa, hydro, organic, synthetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only done indoor so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've only really done synthetic,
like salt based nutrients so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the grows I've done have been in
cocoa or like a cocoa mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: But recently, I moved to like a flood and
drain style growing with hydrogen pellets,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little expanded clay pellets,
which has been pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been enjoying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of the commercial side of things,
like the processes that they do
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially, how much of that do you take
and implement in your home grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some of it that was useful for me
to see just like having a SOP and having a
[SPEAKER_00]: way you do things and knowing how
important it is maybe to only try to
[SPEAKER_00]: implement one new change at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I'm implementing three new
changes at a time and one of them worked,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be really hard for me to
tell which one worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like trellising, learning the
importance of things that every grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facility I've ever been in does across the
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, there has to be a reason
why we're all doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nice defoliations, trellising and
supporting your plants, getting nice light
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration, and CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I would have been so
determined that like I have to run CO2 if
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't seeing like every single
commercial facility is all running CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get to CO2 here in a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for home growing, it's kind of
split between the people who do supplement
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 and people who don't supplement CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can hear your thoughts on that
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only at the very, very first grow facility
I ever worked at, which I was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation side there, but it was such a
large facility and I was such a new
[SPEAKER_00]: employee there that my main job was mostly
just scrubbing out reservoirs all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing really glamorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't really get a chance to learn
a whole lot, but they were running
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the same exact setup I'm running
at home, just on a much larger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the only commercial facility
I've ever been in that had that setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were able to get a little bit of
knowledge from there and bring it to your
[SPEAKER_01]: home grow because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least it wasn't like completely
foreign.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew what the basic parts of the setup
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew how it functioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew how to take one apart and put it
back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a lot of weight off my
shoulders already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you're getting in,
like at least for me, when I was getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into this, having all these timers and
water pumps and everything is dependent on
[SPEAKER_00]: the electricity, it could all feel really
overwhelming really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was nice to start with at least
a system I had had my hands on before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a lot of new grows out
there that really get intimidated by all
[SPEAKER_01]: the pieces of equipment, you know,
when it comes to hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically you have all of your
nutrients and your water in one main
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have a couple of pumps and timers
and your timer is set up to where your
[SPEAKER_00]: water from your reservoir pumps to the
buckets where your plants are for a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's them get some nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after whatever time you determine
it pumps the water out of the plant bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the main reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just set that up to cycle
throughout the day so you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: different periods of flooding and
draining.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have different periods where you
have nutrient uptake and you have periods
[SPEAKER_00]: where you also have a lot of availability
for the roots to get oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to worry about root rot
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, and then would that be on a schedule?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about kind of the watering,
flooding schedule for the ebb and flow set
[SPEAKER_01]: up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the system I have right now is just
on like the old school analog timer where
[SPEAKER_00]: you push the little pins out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every one of those pins is 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I have a little seedling that's
just like in the little peat moss cube,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll really only try to touch that cube
enough times throughout the day so it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe one 15 minute flood every two or
three hours, depending on how it seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: be reacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the plant is growing and
getting bigger, then I'm bumping it up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll go one 15 minute flood every
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time I'm all the way into
flower and the plants are bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how big the plants are,
I might be flooding multiple times per
[SPEAKER_00]: hour all the way throughout the day,
24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I assume that you've got nutrients in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using some synthetic line of
nutrients and what's the EC or PPM that
[SPEAKER_01]: you aim for for the different stages of
growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm running all salt based nutrients
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I've been running Athena.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been liking it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my first run with Athena.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also recently been running auto
flowers, which I'm not used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually I might be and a lot of times
I'm just testing this in like a PPM
[SPEAKER_00]: reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times in veg, I might be
getting up to 700 or 800 PPMs in the peak
[SPEAKER_00]: of veg and then maybe even over a thousand
PPMs in the peak of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found that these auto flowers I've
been running, it's just a few,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they seem to like a lot or need a lot
less nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been running about half of that
strength with the auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've pretty much been taking the feeding
chart that Athena recommends and just
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting it straight in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been working really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a common question that people
ask is about auto flowers and their
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's often here that it requires less
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people say, no, it requires the
same amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's one of like the debated
topics amongst the community is whether or
[SPEAKER_01]: not auto should be treating differently
when it comes to feedings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting to hear your
experience that, yeah, you've had to cut
[SPEAKER_01]: the dose in half there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I tried, I went with the full
strength and I could just, you could see
[SPEAKER_00]: the normal signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wasn't happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see the leaf tip burn starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just backed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I let it go for maybe a whole
week before I was like, I got to change
[SPEAKER_00]: this reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it felt like too much because I
think what it was recommending even early
[SPEAKER_00]: in veg was 1100 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it said that this formulation is made
to run at a higher EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, all right, let's,
let's try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never tried these nutrients before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go with what they recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was just this particular
cultivar because the whole plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, finished is only this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes sense that it doesn't need
that much salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some auto flowers can grow massive
and then some stay squat really comes down
[SPEAKER_01]: to genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously it comes down to other things,
the lighting environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nutrition, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, some could be real small.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes sense for those smaller plants
to need lesser nutrition, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now mixing up those nutrients in water,
what is your water source?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just using tap water or you
filtering the water in some way,
[SPEAKER_01]: like reverse osmosis or what's your water
source?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 75 gallon per day RO filter in
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just hooked up underneath my kitchen
sink and it's all off 90% of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know like every time I'm about to
have to say, I have to fill my reservoir
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go ahead and turn on the filter
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill me up a few five gallon buckets and
get ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always have the RO water at the
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to worry about going and
trying to get distilled water or worrying
[SPEAKER_00]: about what's in my water supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know just a few years ago here
in Denver, the city of Denver sent out
[SPEAKER_00]: Brita water filters to everyone and
they're like, Hey, we highly suggest that
[SPEAKER_00]: before you drink the water from your sink,
that you put it through this Brita filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since a lot of plants are so good at
holding onto things like heavy metals and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that they have access through,
through the roots, I just figured that's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing I want to risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better safe than sorry, but I'm in a
similar boat to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in Las Vegas and out the tap it's
$485.
[SPEAKER_01]: PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to people who, uh, who tune into my
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard me say that a ton of times,
but I figure I'd mention it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I also use reverse osmosis
and I like how the newer systems are now
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a one for one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The past system I had was a one for three
for every one gallon you get of reverse
[SPEAKER_01]: osmosis water, you're wasting three
gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the system that I bought is a one for
one, which is so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so much faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger tubing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the same one or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still on the old one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it, I don't know what the
ratio is, but if you hold up the waste
[SPEAKER_00]: line and the fill line, you see the waste
line pouring in the fill line dripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hate doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always trying to figure out what,
what can we use this water for?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we use this waste water for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people, what they do is they
put it in their backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: They water their plants back with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use it and they, they have
their drain line hooked up to a five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon bucket and they flush their toilets
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Save you a couple of toilet flushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you can use that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a lot of water sources,
they go right back into the local watermen
[SPEAKER_01]: dispel system and that gets cleaned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it really being fully wasted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's going back into the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's energy that takes to kind of
reclean and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's a, that's a bigger debate
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after you mix in the nutrients,
does it require a pH adjustment at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the way that Athena works is you put
in the pH adjustment first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sort of a little, it's actually
the exact opposite of what you would
[SPEAKER_00]: expect from a lot of other lines where you
would mix all of your stuff and then
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust your pH at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do it that way the first time to judge
how many milliliters per gallon I needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next time you can do that first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, with hydro especially,
I'm always super on top or I try to be
[SPEAKER_00]: super on top of the pH because not only
have I experienced with hydro something I
[SPEAKER_00]: never dealt with before, which is a pH
drift, because I never really had a
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting around for, you know, two weeks,
I would mix up the nutrients and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: use them that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get a little drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your pH will slightly rise over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's because probably
because I have an air stone in my
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir, but also with hydro,
there's no buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you had soil, it probably would be
a much better buffers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coco would even be a good buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have some beneficial bacteria,
that's going to help be a mediator between
[SPEAKER_00]: this crazy pH water and your bare roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the hydro system, it's just bare
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrient mix goes right to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a nutrient mix and the pH
is way, way off, that could really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really affect your plants with just like
one or two feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to go in every single morning,
check the pH every morning, adjust if
[SPEAKER_00]: needed, and again in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to check and adjust my pH as
needed twice a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you typically aim for,
for a pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going for a 5.8 to 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first will reset the reservoir,
like the first night, I'm always making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that I'm shooting for that low end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll shoot for the 5.8 because I know
if in the 10 or 12 hours I'm gone before I
[SPEAKER_00]: check it again, if it does rise a little
bit, hopefully I won't get out of my sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: spot of that 5.8 to 6.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's typically what I'm aiming for in
deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So similar with hydro setup, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use Blue Planet Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cool thing about that set of
nutrient lineup is once I mix it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, it always mixes up to 5.8 pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like just perfect exactly where I
want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I change the reservoir,
I add that in there and it's at the
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect set pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I do encounter a little bit of pH
drift, but I've noticed for the most part
[SPEAKER_01]: it drifts downwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people say the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say it drifts upwards for them,
but yeah, I mean I go 5.8 pH the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a 5.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even gone down to like 5.1 and I have
to pH up it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I've never heard of that either
because even before this, I've only done
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before this I was running the General
Hydroponics Flora series.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was running like, it was the
three part Flora series plus a few
[SPEAKER_00]: additives, maybe a six part or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was having the same issue with the
drift, but it was still going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I was really new to this,
I just started asking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I seem to hear from everyone is
that pH drift is common and it usually
[SPEAKER_00]: always drifts up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a million different reasons why
that could happen, but I never really
[SPEAKER_00]: heard about it going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me neither until I actually
experienced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I've been able to adjust it and
get things back on track there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, 5.8, 6.2 same exact range.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I aim for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take a step back and get more
into your grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size grow space are you in and how
many plants do you typically run in that
[SPEAKER_01]: space?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've been liking the most until I
recently had to downsize was a five by
[SPEAKER_00]: five tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was running two five by five tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had like a big basement that they could
both go in, but I liked having the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces separated because I'd rather have
two harvest at two separate times rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than harvesting a 10 by 10 plant and
having to deal with that whole drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: trim jail of a 10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll run the five by five and I like to
space out just four plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be able to run those four plants a
little bit bigger, but with some
[SPEAKER_00]: trellising, I'll still be able to fill out
the canopy all the way from corner to
[SPEAKER_00]: corner really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that mix because it's not too
crowded and it's not too many plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: me to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with these new auto flowers I'm
running, I'm looking at a five by five and
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that if I had these ones that are
staying this small and this wide,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a foot tall and a foot wide,
that there's no telling how many I could
[SPEAKER_00]: run in a five by five, especially if I'm
doing like three gallon pots, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're doing right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three gallon or?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been doing five gallon pots,
but that's because I'm usually running
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period plants that I let veg for a
few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually run them pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want that big root mass for the
bigger plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on this plant I'm running now that's
an auto flower, I don't think the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: barely as wide as the pot is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rule of thumb I've always heard is
as above, so below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So roughly the size and shape of your
plant above the ground will be roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: what your root mass size will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm going off that, I'm looking at
this pot and thinking, it might not even
[SPEAKER_00]: be needed to be that big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a ton of people will get away with
just one gallon containers in one ebb and
[SPEAKER_01]: flow system, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can go a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remind me, I know you said in the very
beginning, but what's in the containers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just hydroton or did you say cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a, um, so inside of the buckets
themselves are square buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have square fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fabric pot is filled with hydrogen
clay pellets and then right in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: of that is like a little net basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'll have where I'm
starting my seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the middle of the net basket will
be like a little peat moss based growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cube, like a little rapid rooter cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then since you're in a flood drain
system, a tray in that five by five,
[SPEAKER_01]: are you running a, is it a four foot by
four foot tray or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the re the way this setup works is
it's all contained in buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the reservoir and then what you
have called the brain bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a few floats and sensors in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just has lines at the very bottom
of the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the brain bucket, which what it's
called the main bucket that feeds all your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant buckets, it will fill up to whatever
level you set it with the float.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then through the outlets in the very
bottom of that bucket, it just leaks out
[SPEAKER_00]: through the force of gravity and whatever
level this brain bucket is, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: just sort of settles out at that same
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it's time to drain back to
the reservoir, there's one pump in the
[SPEAKER_00]: brain bucket that sort of sucks all the
water back from all of the plant buckets
[SPEAKER_00]: and pumps it back to the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit different than the
traditional style ebb and flow system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a flood drain tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you might have like a table like
you're describing and you could just flood
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole table, let that sit there for a
while and then just let gravity drain the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole table out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this way you have a little more
flexibility with your layout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could go maybe different shapes or
wider than a tray might allow me to go
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to buy a new tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with this, I have a 30 gallon
reservoir that I only really fill up to
[SPEAKER_00]: about 25 gallons full.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with this one brain bucket,
if I had like a 60 gallon reservoir,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could run two dozen plant sites,
plant buckets, from that one brain bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems like you get some good flexibility
doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really expanded it to more than
four plants because I've never really run
[SPEAKER_00]: this system in anything bigger than a five
by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I ever want to, all I have to do is
grab a few more buckets and a few more
[SPEAKER_00]: feet of rubber hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this been on your channel yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have videos of this setup or maybe
on your Instagram or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we've been running through it a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: On our live streams recently, but the last
grow series I did, we were still in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the beginners grow guide series.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I ran a five by five with the
hydrogen and the hydro set up like we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been talking about in my kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did end up filming the whole thing,
even though it was sort of just to film it
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing a five by five tent in my
active kitchen that I also cook dinner and
[SPEAKER_00]: eat in every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I never got around to editing it
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a bad habit of just filming the
footage and letting it sit in a folder
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking, you know, I'll get to that one
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's just gigabytes and gigabytes
of plant stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need to find all these notes and put
it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've never put it out on the channel
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm gearing up right now, setting up a
new grow space that I want to try a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds of, I want to try like a
drip feed from the top too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of a flood and drain, I want to
try, I want to try some new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm setting up some new growth spaces
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2025 will hopefully have a lot of
hydroponics on the channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can totally relate when you say that
you, you film all the footage and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: never get around to editing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have filmed dozens of videos that never
actually made it to YouTube unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, I don't think a lot of
viewers really understand how long it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes to edit, especially with the grow
video, because just the time involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking at at least four months of
footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you only go take a few clips every
day, that's still so many shots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting into lighting next,
what type of lights do you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there a certain amount of PAR that
you aim for?
[SPEAKER_01]: For your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always running LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, I really don't have like a
brand loyalty to any specific LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when I was first getting into the
legal industry, I saw a lot of places and
[SPEAKER_00]: I still do see a lot of places running
these big double ended 1200 watt high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sodium bulbs and they get so
incredibly hot and they use so much
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't make sense to me why all
of these facilities don't switch over to
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs, especially with the LED technology
we have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people are growing amazing plants
with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like the LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like any, any light that I can
take the ballast off of the light and
[SPEAKER_00]: mount it outside of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love those because I like to
shoot for lower temps at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, especially if I have something
that has those really pretty anthocyanins
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm really trying to bring that color
change out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as for like a PAR, I really
like anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really looking for that sweet spot of
something that can reach like a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles per meter squared per second,
I think is the measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking for that center of that
heat map of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where my eye always goes to
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it hitting a thousand or is it not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know, especially like we were
saying, sometimes if you're running CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I can push the plant harder
with more lumens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can push it a little harder with more
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can push it a little harder with
nutrients because it's just that CO2 is
[SPEAKER_00]: helping it photosynthesize more
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like if I want that really
bright light, I would always rather have
[SPEAKER_00]: more light than I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you can always turn it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I get into the end of flower and I
feel like I don't have enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: well now I'm stuck with the light that
I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to dim it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also increases the lifespan of the
fixture running it at a lower percentage
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're not having to run it at a
hundred percent all day, every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you need, do you know what brand and
model light you have in your five by five
[SPEAKER_01]: or?
[SPEAKER_00]: The five by five was a Spider Farmer SE
7,000, which is a really nice light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's big and it's bright, but the ballast
comes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was helpful and it never gave me
any problems at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just gifted that light to a
homie on the discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope they're growing some good plants
with it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spider Farmer is a very popular brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been around for so long now,
10 plus years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people run their lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a handful of their lights in the
past and I used to do par tests back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day, I think 2019, 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had my hands on a bunch of their
fixtures and I used a couple of their
[SPEAKER_01]: fixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: The SP 2000 I used, SP 4000.
[SPEAKER_00]: See when they were on the SP, I don't even
think I was familiar with their products
[SPEAKER_00]: when they were on the SP line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if I've heard of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I got it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they change up the line, you know,
like the acronyms for the line every few
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always getting confused,
but I do see it like even in the discord
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people in my discord
running Spider Farmer lights and all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of Spider Farmer gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I meant SF 2000, SF 4000 on SP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I misspoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time since I ran those
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's how they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will throw in a SP.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll throw in a million SFs and then
they'll throw in a SP and you'll be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hold up, what's the SP?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is SP?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those are the board style that they
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they still sell it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody's going after the bar
style, which is the SC series that you
[SPEAKER_01]: had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that has a lot better light
spread, provides that light spread,
[SPEAKER_01]: more even light spread across the coverage
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having that hotspot in the middle and then
having to drop off significantly towards
[SPEAKER_01]: the outer edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a thing of the past now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, it's not ideal at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also like the open design of having
these open bars rather than a big hunk of
[SPEAKER_00]: like some kind of plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now all of that heat that comes
off your diodes, it can just go straight
[SPEAKER_00]: up between your bars instead of having to
make its way, linger around right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of your canopy until it can eventually
get blown by a fan and make its way around
[SPEAKER_00]: that big board.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get up to your exhaust fan and make it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some of the heat does go through
the actual fixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like a heat sink.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does actually go through it and
upwards in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, that's a good point too.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them have like heat fins all over
the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, those were some crazy designs back in
the day for those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So heat, is that an issue where you are
at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of let's get into the environment a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature, what do you typically aim
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually going for like a low around
75, maybe a high around like, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let, I'll let some plants go over
like, you know, high 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, I'm not scared when I have a lot
of CO2 in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not scared to see 90 degrees,
89 degrees, 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant looks healthy, I have my
little infrared thermometer so I can put
[SPEAKER_00]: the laser on a leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see what my leaf surface temp is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as the leaf surface temp isn't
crazy high, I don't really mind running
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I try to not, well, and that,
that is with supplemented CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for my nighttime temps,
I try not to swing, I really never want to
[SPEAKER_00]: swing more than 15 degrees from day to
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like to keep it more to like
10 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I want to go colder, colder at
night, I like to start dropping down in
[SPEAKER_00]: the daytime too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really always thinking about like,
what is the plant evolved to like over
[SPEAKER_00]: millennia of growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end of the season, you're going
to get colder temps in the day and the
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times I'll try to mimic that
same thing indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can have so many benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Dr. Bruce Bugbee had mentioned,
oh geez, it was years ago now,
[SPEAKER_01]: he had revealed that a lot of people are
dropping the temps late in flower in order
[SPEAKER_01]: to conserve the terpenes that are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I actually recently watched one of
your videos, you were talking about how
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpenes can volatize, evaporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose them in the air, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The higher the temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a curing video that you
were talking about that in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's true when you're growing the
plant as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people will open up their
grow tent or open up their room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, ah, it smells beautiful in
here, but they're running too high of a
[SPEAKER_01]: temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're losing all that, those terpenes
off the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that all would have been in your
curing jar if your temp would have been
[SPEAKER_00]: lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some of these can start to
volatize and evaporate at as low as like
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 degrees, like just regular standard,
what you would consider a cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're thinking about these things
trying to survive right under this light
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're six inches away and they're 96
degrees with no airflow, they don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing everything they can just to
survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cooking off those dry combs at those high
temps.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Dr. Bugby had mentioned is people
drop it down to about 75 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit, 78 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people go lower than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to translate to the folks that
use in Celsius, 75 degrees Fahrenheit is
[SPEAKER_01]: 23 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you had mentioned you go
sometimes up to 85 degrees, which is 29
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just wanted to convert that over for
the folks that are working in Celsius
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have had no idea what the
conversion is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's daytime and nighttime temps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned you're running CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about relative humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you typically aim for there?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning of veg, I'm trying like
when I have a really small seedling,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do whatever I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might even put a little dome over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get maybe 65% or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I'm going through veg, that's going
to eventually taper off and level out to
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe around 55, 60% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a big chart on the wall that shows
you where your ideal VPD range is at
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever specific temp you are for
whatever desired kilopascal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always trying to reference that
chart nowadays and get the VPD dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it always seems to feel if I was going
off my gut, I think I would always run the
[SPEAKER_00]: tent a little drier than what this VPD
chart tells me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've just been going with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it a little hot and sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I typically aim for that VPD range as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to my surprise, it's usually when I'm
looking at the temperature I'm running and
[SPEAKER_01]: the humidity I naturally used to run
before I even knew about VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fell within that VPD range.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ideal range on those charts,
there's different colors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The dark green is the optimal range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a light green,
which are really the tolerance range or
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable range to be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit wider.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have the yellow range or even
red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them have red ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry to cut you off, but that relates
directly to how efficient this plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be at using nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it's not able to transpire
properly at the rate it needs to,
[SPEAKER_00]: well then it's not going to draw up water
in the rate it needs to or at the rate
[SPEAKER_00]: that it could.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've seen a lot of new folks that are
beginners and they get caught up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They struggle with running those higher
humidities because oftentimes it runs a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit higher of a humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It calls on the VPD chart for a little bit
higher of humidity than what some people
[SPEAKER_01]: are traditionally used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are a lot of people that say,
Oh, I run around 40% relative humidity in
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people run 50% in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, depending on the temperature,
that could potentially be a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of that optimal range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's still within the tolerance range.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is still going to grow,
but some people do aim to be in that dark
[SPEAKER_01]: green range at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plants, a lot of these medicinal
plants, they'll put up with a lot and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll still grow and they'll take you
all the way to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you never knew to try something
else, you might not even see a sign that
[SPEAKER_00]: they could do much better until you tried
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow in the desert here and there has
been times where I really didn't monitor
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD or humidity at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was before YouTube back in 2011,
2012, before I started watching YouTube,
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say I was running 30% humidity,
35% humidity, the whole grow and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants still grow and I still got to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll never know that, Oh man,
maybe my plants would have been a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler if I would have paid attention to
that because you got done and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, these look amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could have been so much better.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity is one thing that is a little
tricky for me here in Denver, just like it
[SPEAKER_00]: is for you in Vegas, I assume,
because it's just dry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just super dry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get this high humidity, I'm always
running a humidifier and the hydroponics
[SPEAKER_00]: does help a lot because say I'm in the
five by five, I'm running a little high
[SPEAKER_00]: temp and I have five, five gallon buckets
in the tent that fill up, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a majority of the way full of water or I
mean four of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a lot of the portion of the day,
there's 20 gallons of water just like open
[SPEAKER_00]: to the air in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helps a lot, which was great until
this last five by five run, it came up
[SPEAKER_00]: like it was going to be just so happens
the last few weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to be out of town and I didn't
really have anyone who knew what they were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing to watch the plants that could
really, you know, play it by ear and make
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to say, when the water gets
low, add some more water, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the house doesn't catch on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be back as soon as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that humidity from those buckets,
just from that, even with my exhaust fan
[SPEAKER_00]: set on 10, they said this exhaust fan
didn't go off the whole time you were out
[SPEAKER_00]: of town, but it just couldn't get it down
enough, which really surprised me in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up getting bud rot and like
the majority of my bigger chunkier,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, bud sites, I had bud rot and it was,
it was really surprising, but it was a big
[SPEAKER_00]: learning curve that I didn't really think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm introducing 20 gallons of water into
this grow tent right under a hot lamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of humidity that I'm going to
have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm just exhausting it out into my
lung room and sucking it right back up
[SPEAKER_00]: into the tent, that humidity never had a
chance to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up having to use a,
uh, I think I'm going to use a two in one
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier slash AC unit if I have to,
to fight that on my next round.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really shocking how much of an impact
it has on the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the same thing, my DWC system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even need to run a humidifier in
this grow tent because the plants just
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiring and it's raising up that
humidity so quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the exhaust kicks on a certain,
uh, when it reaches a certain point and it
[SPEAKER_01]: exhausts the air out of there,
that, that humid air in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it brings in that dry air that I have
naturally here in my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, also it's true for auto watering
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just going from hand watering soil,
for example, going to an auto watering
[SPEAKER_01]: system, whether it be a auto pot system,
or I've been running blue mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have that constant moisture level in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's able to take up water and
transpire and it raises the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people run into the problem
where, uh, lights off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They realize that lights off.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden the plant is transpiring
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The humidity just spikes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where a lot of people they'll
end their light cycle and they'll open up
[SPEAKER_01]: their tent and they'll start to see
powdery mildew because of their
[SPEAKER_01]: unbeknownst to this humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The humidity spike during lights off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it can, it's very surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very shocked when I first
encountered that it's helpful for me
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't have to fill my humidifier
as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a shock though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I thought like, you know,
I thought this is going to be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about the humidity, but I didn't
like, I really underestimated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this is going to be nice,
you know, fill up my humidifier less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my brother called me, I'm in Texas at
the time and my brother called me and he
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, Hey man, this humidity is like
above what you wrote down where it should
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fan just won't go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, you can open the door
during lights on, but at night,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't know what you can do without
me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would have to workshop this in
front of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess just to do what you can and
I'll be home soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the importance and
lessons learned, I guess of if you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: exhaust outside of the room entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just dump it into your long room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now some people can get away with it,
but traditionally a lot of people have to
[SPEAKER_01]: resort to either drill in a hole in their
wall to get it out to a whole different
[SPEAKER_01]: room or exhausting out a window,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, getting that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm trying to put up for the new
room, I absolutely, it's a must for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to exhaust every tent
out of the house and I'm probably going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull in our at least have the option to
whenever I want, flip on a fan and pull in
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, air from outside of the house also
so I can get the old air out, the new air
[SPEAKER_00]: in, but it's a little different when
you're running CO2 because I also don't
[SPEAKER_00]: just, if I want, if I can avoid it,
I don't want to just dump all my CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: straight out of the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I think where a lot of people
steer themselves the wrong way is they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement CO2, but then they'll have
their inline fan kick on exhausted all out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into CO2 a little bit deeper
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you supplement CO2 using the tanks
or using one of the other methods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I've used, I've never tried the
little cans, but I have tried the,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are they called?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the name, but the little
mycelium bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had those, I've ran them more than
they recommend you to run them like more
[SPEAKER_00]: in my space than they say you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seemed like for me personally,
in my limited experience, I could never
[SPEAKER_00]: really get the PPM of CO2 I was looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the highest I ever got with three
of those bags in a five by five tent was
[SPEAKER_00]: like 860 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I have got, I just run a 20 pound
tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 20 pound tank right outside of my
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an automatic controller that goes
in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little fan in that controller
that's always pulling air through the box
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting a CO2 rating on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can set my high and low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then if I set my low to say 800 and
my high to 1400, as soon as the CO2 dips
[SPEAKER_00]: below 800, the electronic valve will open
and that tank will start leaking out CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just piped in through a little small
air hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This run right to the very top of my tent
because the CO2 is really heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I run it up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to have it fall down and as
it's falling through the canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these fans towards the bottom of the
tent are just going to keep it moving all
[SPEAKER_00]: around the leaf surfaces so they can just
use it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because your leaf can really only use the
CO2 that is like right there touching the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf surface on the top and the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always want to be moving it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after you get it set up, after I have
this set up, it was a little expensive to
[SPEAKER_00]: set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The controller is a little expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The valve isn't very expensive,
but the electronic controller is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that first CO2 tank I think was close
to 200 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way it works is it's just an
exchange program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now every time I want to go get more
CO2, I just take my empty tank to the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: shop, drop it off and pick up a new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like refill it or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have full ones there waiting on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that price to refill that is very,
very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm paying under, I think it's like $15.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so small that I don't even know the
exact price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because usually when I add it to whatever
else I'm getting from the grow store,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how much it costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was under 20 bucks is all I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the potential that you can get in
your growth, and not just your growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not always about biomass,
it's not always about plant size.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, I like the CO2 really because it
makes my plant, it just seems to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant more hearty in every way I can
imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to make it more resilient to
drought stress, more resilient to heat
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, more resilient to pest and
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can get faster plant growth,
that's always great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I'm not going for a bigger plant,
I always like to get to harvest quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can save a little time, that's always
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me time to start a new round.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a study out of Utah State
University where they ran 1400 ppm in the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering stage and they got a 30%
increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Debaco University covered
that on his YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you see those pictures of those
plants, you're like, well, that's clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's clear as day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the clearest thing I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way I'm going to... When you
realize it... And for me, it was really...
[SPEAKER_00]: What really made me look into it is when I
realized how many of these big commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities might cut corners to save money
here and there and there and there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're cutting corners to save money
wherever they can, but never, ever,
[SPEAKER_00]: ever on the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2 is running all day, every day,
really high, 1400, 1500, PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because they've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they've had a room that had a
few hundred plants in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had a room right beside it
with a few hundred plants in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they only had enough CO2 one round to
run it in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they saw the difference in these two
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, okay, that was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was 30% more money came out of the
same size room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can never make that mistake again.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So super beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good can come out of it,
although it is upfront cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned $200 for the tank to begin
plus hundreds of dollars for the
[SPEAKER_01]: controller valve, all that stuff,
but it's for itself pretty quickly there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you running it daytime only?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will just do CO2 in the
daytime and they'll say ignore it during
[SPEAKER_01]: nighttime?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The controller I have is actually set up
to run exactly that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has...
[SPEAKER_00]: It's monitoring two things at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is the fan that pulls the
air through and reads the actual PPMs of
[SPEAKER_00]: the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is just a little light
monitor right on the front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: controller box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you put that inside of your tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anytime there isn't a very bright
light source, like if your grow light
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't turned on, then that thing just
defaults to stay off all night long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all during the night or all during
lights off, it's not putting out any CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as the lights come on in
the morning, it just starts all over
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing to mention about those tanks,
talking to what I call a buddy of mine,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris from Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on the podcast actually twice now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things he had mentioned is
when he was running CO2, I think the story
[SPEAKER_01]: had to do with his buddy running a CO2 and
getting a tank from the grow store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he ended up getting a pest
infestation from that tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't know if this is just a
one-off instance, but I think he got
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how they were attached to the
tank, but he brought that in without
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning the tank or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then his garden got infested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what the odds are,
what the chances of that happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I'd mention that here in case
anybody else is getting those tanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to consider cleaning it off
to prevent pests from coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never actually done that,
but I have had the thought before because
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the grow store hearing
someone talk about having pests at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked over at them like,
oh man, we're in the same building right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pest might've came from your...
Because if you're in the garden and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're on your clothes and then you come
to the grow store with all these
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental plants and all this soil to
live in, it's like a pest dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can just live in there and
hitchhike home on your sleeve or on your
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happens more than we know it, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting into pests a little bit more,
have you ever come across any major pest
[SPEAKER_01]: infestations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I've never come across any major
pest infestations at home in my personal
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had pretty decent outbreaks of fungus
gnats a couple of times, but those were
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty easily gotten under control with
just some yellow sticky traps and some
[SPEAKER_00]: diatomaceous earth on the top of my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But working in the legal commercial space,
I have seen things that look like the
[SPEAKER_00]: movie Arachnophobia with spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen thrips so thick that it makes
you want to crawl out of your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen so many worst case scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen rooms with pium and stuff that
make it look like it's snowing when you
[SPEAKER_00]: shake the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've always been, since day one,
when I started my first garden at home,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been super duper scared of
that cross contamination from the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facility to my little home
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I bring, I look at the bugs and
the pests, especially these spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the commercial space as like super
mites, because you've got to think they
[SPEAKER_00]: come from a colony of like 40 million,
maybe 40 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have multiple, multiple rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each room has maybe a hundred,
a few hundred, maybe a thousand plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all like a big budget commercial
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're running around spraying their IPM
and trying their best to kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ones that survived all of that are
the strongest of the strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've lived in all these
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were born and bred inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come from indoor gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like if I get these little
suckers in my house, that I'll never get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the infestations I see at work,
like usually when I see these
[SPEAKER_00]: infestations, like the ones I'm talking
about, you just open the door and you
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately see webbing across a whole
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing you can do for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've spent days pre-harvest just
trying to do physical removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's far too late into the growth cycle to
use a chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll be going through with a wet paper
towel or a rag or something, trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: wipe the nugs off before we go to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, there's nothing you can do
when it gets that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's prevention is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I come home, I always quarantine
my clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take my clothes off outside,
as far away from my growth space as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put those in a bag and I seal that
bag up and they stay in that bag until
[SPEAKER_00]: they go to the laundry mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: No chances.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a smart way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you haven't had any major
pest infestations that you brought from
[SPEAKER_01]: the commercial facility there that you've
only come across fungus gnats and to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to get rid of them pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pests can be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of challenges that can
occur really not just with pests,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with different parts of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ebb and flow system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about some of the
common issues or challenges that new
[SPEAKER_01]: growers may face when using an ebb and
flow system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think one of the most common issues,
cause I'm still new to the ebb and flow
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think maybe some of these beginner
problems I haven't even faced yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're like, um, right around the
corner probably for me, find some new
[SPEAKER_00]: problems I haven't seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One really common one is it's really easy
to forget that right behind you,
[SPEAKER_00]: this reservoir has 30 gallons of water in
it and you forget how the properties of
[SPEAKER_00]: siphoning and gravity work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the tip of this hose goes below the
surface level of that water and I turn my
[SPEAKER_00]: back on it for two seconds, I might have
20 gallons of water in the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have like things like pH drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really not, that's one thing I'm
looking forward to finding out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the common problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people run into issues with
getting their system clogged or dirty or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe running or trying to run too many
organic nutrients or just stuff that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: gunky in the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really am not sure what my problems
are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far in my experience, I've found that
as long as I keep my EC and my PPM dialed
[SPEAKER_00]: in in that reservoir, that's the main
thing that I'm worrying about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really this flood and drain system has
been a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been so easy for me and I don't want
to curse myself, but it's been very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very hassle-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really had much of any problems
to speak of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants just grow so fast and they
grow so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like such constant, almost
constant availability to nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy that it's been so easy for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're saying those words and I
feel the same way about deep horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew in soil for 14 years and I just did
my first run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually I've had them flowering here in a
two by four and it's been so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little stumbled at first to
trying to figure things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting the pH kind of dialed in the
EC water temperature is another thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you figure those things out,
it's been so easy for me for most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow because of all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I feel the same way about my
hydroponic system that you feel about
[SPEAKER_01]: yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you running any beneficial bacteria in
your flood and drain?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean in your, I mean in your deep water?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, just the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: In there with an air stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we get towards the end of the
episode here, one of the questions I like
[SPEAKER_01]: to ask folks is, can you name off the top
three strains that you've grown and what
[SPEAKER_01]: you liked about them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't grown too many at home,
but let me try to think of some that were
[SPEAKER_00]: at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that I really liked was Cushmints from
Exotic Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really dense, really pretty,
really nice, crazy, dark purple hues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavorful, real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very photogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Moneyball, which is the one I did in
the flood and drain down in the kitchen
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was from, oh, the first one I said
Cushmints was from Exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually from Ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Moneyball was Exotic Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a Gary Peyton, Gary Poppins
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one was just super, super frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had some really big nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nugs that I lost to Bud Rot, but it was so
frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another one that was amazing was
one called Orange Heroana that we used to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in this commercial facility I worked
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably one of the, has to be one of the
top three craziest smelling terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles I've ever smelled before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like just pure candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not smell like a plant at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like a sugar purple candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any huge, huge fat nugs on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to check those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't grown any of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, this is a question that I've
just actually started asking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, half a dozen episodes or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like the audience really
likes to hear about what their favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had some people in the comments
are like, yeah, I just picked some up
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm so stoked of what I've heard
about it, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wrapping things up here, can you tell
the listeners how they can find you and
[SPEAKER_01]: what you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a few different series coming up
about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do some more growing tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to document some of my hydro
experiences coming up very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're starting off 2025 with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all on my YouTube channel,
just youtube.com slash strain show.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have a link to Matt's
channel down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_01]: section below.
