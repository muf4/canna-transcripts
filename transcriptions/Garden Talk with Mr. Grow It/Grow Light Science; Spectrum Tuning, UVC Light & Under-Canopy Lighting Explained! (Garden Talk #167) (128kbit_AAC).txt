[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are the founder, CEO of Grandmaster
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before that, I've known you,
of you since 10 plus years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you've been doing the YouTube
thing and content creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've ran commercial facilities
and hundreds of flights and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know you have a very extensive
background, really focusing in on
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is what we're going to get into
today, a variety of topics when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, before we get too deep into the
things, can you give us an introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my name is Thomas Gibson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm based out of Vancouver Island,
British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this basically my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first outdoor medicinal crop was when I
was 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first indoor was by the time I was 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I was 20, 21, I would have
anywhere from nine to 10 places going for
[SPEAKER_00]: almost two decades where there'd be
anywhere from 200 to 500 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done this just my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got into this originally to make money
and I came from a very, very poor
[SPEAKER_00]: background, but developed a passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the plant and I just love growing.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's your overall style of growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you indoors mostly or outdoors as
well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil, cocoa, organic, synthetic,
what's your style?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for majority of my commercial career
would have been pro mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would actually add a lot of perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the beginning, I think it would be
more synganic for the first 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a partner that really liked using a
lot of organic amendments and then it was
[SPEAKER_00]: more a synthetic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've dabbled with almost everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back into 2001, I can remember
having Rockwell playing with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we would have flood and drain
systems, drip systems, even an aeroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've tried a lot of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, these days, I just have a
medical and I've been experimenting with
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually kind of a hard
transition for me just because with soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dry back is so important in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you try to water something when
it's oversaturated in soil, you can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: real negative effect versus in cocoa where
it likes it and it can take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been having fun just playing
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the automation side of things
where it doesn't require nearly as much
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many different ways to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talk about it in my content often
where it just makes it fun being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: do things different ways for me
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was doing the same thing over and
over again, I'd go crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I personally am kind of like you where
I've experimented with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, kind of narrowed in on,
well, these days I'm kind of narrowing in
[SPEAKER_01]: on the organic, all natural side of
things, soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I do still do have synthetic
grows here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did DWC recently for the first time
and grown for 14 years and grew DWC for
[SPEAKER_01]: the first time, just trying to keep things
fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really just makes things real fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's like, there's a hundred
different ways to get across the finish
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, do what's best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell people it's like,
if you've got something that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: working that well, well, then I wouldn't
really change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, if you're getting those results
that you need, just ignore everybody else
[SPEAKER_00]: and just keep on going straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's dive into lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that you have a lot of
knowledge on for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should kind of warp back in
time a little bit to begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before we get into the first topic,
which is going to be the HPS to LED
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to mention to the folks that
are tuning in on the podcast platforms
[SPEAKER_01]: that there are visuals for this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to head on over to YouTube,
just search garden talk with Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_01]: that channel will play.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll pop up and you'll be able to tune
into this episode with grand master level
[SPEAKER_01]: and then see the visuals that he's going
to present to us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to give you the mic and you
know, I know there's a couple of things
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want to talk about regards to HPS
versus LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So break it down for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just quickly share my screen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing that I'm showing here
is a picture of double ended HPS spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would ask people is, or people,
a lot of people think this isn't a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually think it is actually very
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is unique about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can see that there's 3.996% blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in the range between 400 and 500
nanometer, which is very, very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're comparing to any type of LED,
um, the green is actually pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: 33% is a normal number anywhere between 30
and 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there isn't really anything too special
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next is the red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I like to ask this question,
is all red really red?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a, from a scientific standpoint,
from people that are leading the world in
[SPEAKER_00]: R and D, they're going to say,
yes, it is from someone that's got 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years of commercial cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a big difference between 600
and 620 nanometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see, um, this is like,
if you look where the red peak is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you think about HPS, you see like
an amber color that kind of comes off that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't the same as the red.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other type of red that's 660
nanometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that that's one big thing
to point out that people have to take into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I have seen, and I'm not saying
that one is better than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying that it's a different
temperature light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get the same results with a
different temperature, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some do give you almost some of the
same results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing about this light that is
unique is the amount of far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 10.48%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most lights have under two or 1% far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most companies don't actually even add
far red diodes into the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Far red diodes are the most expensive and
they hurt your efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of, um, you're, you're adding a
big cost and it's going to hurt your
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy number.
[SPEAKER_00]: After LEDs had been on the scenes for a
few years, this is what it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is like a 38K spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make this kind of spectrum,
there's lots of different ways to make
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, there are no spectrums that
are proprietary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody says that they've got a
proprietary spectrum, that's incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody can take any light and stick,
stick it into an integrated sphere and get
[SPEAKER_00]: a report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that bounce shows the balance of blue,
red, far red, green, and you can match
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what everything kind of evolved
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a pretty rock solid
spectrum and it probably varied anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: from 3,800 K to 3,500 K.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would usually make these type
of spectrums with using white diodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually a one to one ratio of like 3000
and 5,000 Kelvin and adding 660 nanometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, they didn't add 730 and there
was, you know, very, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: very little, um, 730 in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then after a few more years went by,
this is what things have evolved into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I would consider a heavy
deep red 660 nanometer spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the big difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can see that you've got this big
massive red spike that is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: dominating everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just go back for a second and you
can just see about how much fuller the
[SPEAKER_00]: other spectrum is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what things have really
evolved into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what, like what people are,
I would say majority of the larger
[SPEAKER_00]: companies are gone in this direction when
they're using single channel lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why are they doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, it's to have a higher
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be more efficient when you add the 660
nanometer diode, it's more efficient than
[SPEAKER_00]: any other diode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it brings your numbers up and it allows
you to hit three micromoles per joule,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, it's very easy to hit if you're
using a bunch of red diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're trying to hit that number
with white diodes, it's actually very hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to hit and you have to use a great number
of diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically that's what things have
evolved into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have people that are coming
from HBS to LED, you can see that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're basically looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're, like a lot of people come and
they're not getting the same results and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're upset and they're saying,
oh, LED is bunk and this is, and HBS
[SPEAKER_00]: produces so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the real gap is the temperature of the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like if you look, one of them has got
20% blue versus 4% blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, which on so many different,
different cultivars can change the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure of the medicinal flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, like we've seen stuff where it can
actually, we can see stuff where it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's from a completely different
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've seen stuff that looks the
same, but has different COAs, different
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really like, am I saying one is
better than the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying that there's a lot of cultivars
that like a warmer spectrum, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: also a lot of cultivars that like a cooler
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to say that one spectrum is the
best spectrum I don't believe you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: that because all like to find out what the
true genetic potential you have to test it
[SPEAKER_00]: and cultivars can act completely
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then next, this is a regular
double-ended HBS versus the warm white
[SPEAKER_00]: channel that we've made in one of our
spectrum tuning lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that it is, the
temperature is almost the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the only thing that's really
different is there's 5.3% far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the double-ended HBS has 10.4%
and the blue, they're slightly more blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can actually adjust that and add it
to balance everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe if you want to get HBS
results under LED, you need to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: same temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tested multiple different
side-by-sides and seen very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, a lot of people like to throw out
radiant heat and say, it's the radiant
[SPEAKER_00]: heat that's making this difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I completely disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're going and transitioning from
HBS to LED, you want to actually keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: same surface leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to achieve that, you actually want to
go to a successful HBS room if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get those same results and
figure out what the hottest point is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as the AC is going to turn on,
you're going to know that that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: hottest point of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can run into the room and take a
bunch of surface leaf temperature readings
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, this is my hottest point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when the AC turns off, I have the
coolest point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know what that range is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can go into my LED room and adjust
my ambient temperature until I'm hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to go by ambient temperature is
like shooting yourself in the foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it depends if you have it higher
up, one higher up than the other one,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be totally different because heat
rises.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think everything should always go
by surface leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should never go by an ambient
temperature because it can really screw
[SPEAKER_00]: with your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: With spectrum tuning, like if someone is
going to want to spectrum tune,
[SPEAKER_00]: they should ask themselves, are they
trying to grow the highest quality
[SPEAKER_00]: possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that is your goal, then yes,
absolutely spectrum tuning is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other question is, are you trying
to find the true genetic potential?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, without spectrum tuning,
it's going to be almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are the major, like there's
three major benefits to spectrum tuning
[SPEAKER_00]: that I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is being able to use blue to
tighten your internode spacing as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly, to be able to use blue at
any time to limit your stretch as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people are tent growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a tent and you might be
limited in height, the ability to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: extra blue is life-changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the ability to actually add blue
later on for the last few weeks of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower is also life-changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for increasing your COAs, it's
undeniable the results that you can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of things that stick out on the
charts that you had shown, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: double ended HPS slide, 3.96% blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize, because I've grown with
HPS before, I didn't realize it was that
[SPEAKER_01]: low in blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: These days, many fixtures are in between
like the 15 and 20% range of blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of is one thing that stuck
out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that really stuck out to
me was I wasn't aware that 60 nanometers
[SPEAKER_01]: was the highest efficiency for lowest
cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think knowing that information and
seeing the different lighting companies
[SPEAKER_01]: out there, you can tell who is just going
after trying to make things kind of more
[SPEAKER_01]: price efficient, I guess you could say.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when I think about growers and
people that are having buying something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be lasting them for five
years, if their goal is to be like the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun, you definitely want the fuller
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'd like to kind of explain what is
spectrum tuning because it can kind of be
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a spectrum tuning light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a spectrum tuning light usually
consists of four different channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those channels is going to be warm
light, which I like to reference is like a
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a cool white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reference it as a metal halide,
but it might not be appropriate because a
[SPEAKER_00]: metal halide will actually have way less
blue and a lot of other stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just referenced it as metal halide
because it's a blue color to your eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has way more blue than a metal
halide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is your cool white channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have a deep red channel that is
660 nanometer that we were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: that's highly efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a far red channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have these four different channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it all different types of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to do it with four independent
drivers and we have lights that are up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 1500 Watts and you use them together to
make all different spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of people get so confused about
1500 Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still only need to run it at six to
750 Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That extra wattage is actually for the
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what a spectrum tuning
light is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're the first company that's
actually simplified spectrum tuning by
[SPEAKER_00]: making two channel spectrum tuning lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically have taken the warm white
and instead of having a deep red and far
[SPEAKER_00]: red controlled independently, we have
fixed it on the warm white channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put it at safe levels where you
couldn't do anything to ever hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you have a four channel light,
there are things that you could do to hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself by using too much far red or too
much deep reds in certain situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you have it on the flight like
that and it's fixed, it's basically
[SPEAKER_00]: simplified where you can't do anything
wrong to hurt yourself, which I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you have a light that can do 500
spectrums or 60 spectrums, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, which spectrum do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, this really simplifies it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes it down to about 12 spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's actually capable of way more
than 12 technically, but that visually
[SPEAKER_00]: look a lot different on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 12 and you can still have the
benefits of going from 2000 Kelvin to
[SPEAKER_00]: 9,000 Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically like a two channel
spectrum tuning light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what are regular lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Regular lights are single channel lights
that have one driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be confusing for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been kind of trying to just break
things down as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we've been developing it,
I'm actually going to share my screen here
[SPEAKER_00]: again, because we actually haven't
published this publicly, but we are about
[SPEAKER_00]: to publish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not showing the whole picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, it's supposed to say
transcend light recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that we've developed
and we're just getting ready to publish
[SPEAKER_00]: the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm working with a company in Canada
that just finished their fourth crop with
[SPEAKER_00]: consecutive making 20% plus gains on
terpenes and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's life changing here in Canada for
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen multiple people do it one
or two crops, but this is four crops in a
[SPEAKER_00]: row where he had already had 20 different
COAs with this previous cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us to make a 20% gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's not like we're just using
one lab because anybody can see one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: with one lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using multiple labs and this is
actually being exported to Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Germany and Australia are known for
having the toughest labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, we have conclusively proven
that you can gain a 20% plus gain by doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just as simple as vegging a 9,000
K to have the tightest internode spacing
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you transition into the
flower stage, you're using a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of cool white and warm white and you leave
it like that until your stretch is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we transition to a spectrum
that's actually even warmer than HBS
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we basically use that until there's
three weeks left and you start introducing
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see we've dampened or we lower
the far red when there's three weeks left
[SPEAKER_00]: and we go back to heavy blue and warm
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with two weeks left, we even reduce
the warm white and completely eliminate
[SPEAKER_00]: the far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the last week, we're finishing in
9,000 Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of people that finish
with 10,000 Kelvin when they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: growing with LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a reason why they do it is the
plants love the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a stress response.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost the same thing that UV does
and it allows them to enhance the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: interpete.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how you broke it down between
different phases of growth and what
[SPEAKER_01]: channels they should have on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was going to be a question for you
that I was going to ask was if I were to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy one of the four channels, what do I
run when?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really cool that you actually
have that broken down already and you've
[SPEAKER_01]: done testing and have results that show
what you can get out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also another company that,
well, multiple companies, but one in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular that we've been working with
that they're really finding out what the
[SPEAKER_00]: true genetic potential is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, we've seen stuff in the
same room under different spectrums look
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's from a different planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they do with a test room,
they have a test room where they have
[SPEAKER_00]: curtains in between the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't have crossover and they'll
run a cultivar with four completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you are comparing spectrums,
one thing I want to bring up is you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you only have a couple percent,
you will not see any difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just try to add 2% blue or
something like that, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see really a difference from everything
that we have seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically they're tested, they're
running the four different cultivars,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing which one performs the best,
getting a COA and then implementing that
[SPEAKER_00]: as their base spectrum and still using the
blue with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I was trying to say is if
you're trying to find the real true
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic potential, that's how you have to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're using more blue than what the
sun has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the blue, like the sun is depending
on where you are and located on the earth
[SPEAKER_00]: is like around 25 to 30% maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to get it up to closer to
37% and just, um, and which I think is a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when you're, when you're using 37%
blue and you're also omitting the 54% red
[SPEAKER_00]: that the sun really has, you can do stuff
that you can't do outside, which I think
[SPEAKER_00]: is really taking things to the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you showed the HPS, a double
ended HPS slide, I want to warp back to
[SPEAKER_01]: that for one second.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that it shows is that
there's a spike at 780 nanometers and
[SPEAKER_01]: talking with growers in the past,
people swear that, Hey, this is the reason
[SPEAKER_01]: why HPS shows different results because of
that spike on the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is infrared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's heat and actually, so I,
I disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand why people think that
because, um, I could go back to that
[SPEAKER_00]: picture where it's showing the HP,
what the new evolved led versus the HPS
[SPEAKER_00]: and the temperature is so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they think that, Hey, we can,
I've tried everything to match it the
[SPEAKER_00]: same, and I can't get the same results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be the infrared heat,
except for none of anyone that is saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can guarantee they've never tried
an LED light with the same temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: match those same surface leaf
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other huge problems with
transitioning from a large HPS room,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people overlook this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take out all their HPS and they
put in their LEDs and now their HVAC
[SPEAKER_00]: system is completely oversized and it's
turning on and off very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, an HVAC is like a big, massive
dehumidifier that you want sized perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: to be as efficient and hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also helps hold the temperature,
but, um, you actually can have a really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard time running LEDs if it gets too cold
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like your surface leaf temperature is
really important, but if people are having
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles that is bringing their surface leaf
temperature down to 73 or 75 Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a really big problem, especially in
the earlier stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the later stages, it can actually be an
SOP to kind of lower the temperature as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, you're going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more question about spectrum before we
move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a lot of folks here that know of
Dr. Bruce Bugby.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is very knowledgeable guy, Utah State
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been working in the industry for over
40 years, very knowledgeable about
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things he had mentioned in one
of his videos is something along,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have an exact quote, but something
along the lines of PAR matters more than
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get your take on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, I agree with that statement,
but like, I think that's a pretty wide
[SPEAKER_00]: open thing to say, because let's compare
like PAR at a hundred percent versus,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, optimized spectrum at 10% or even 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can't compete with that PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR is more important, but when we're
talking about 5% efficiency, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's the actual thing is in today's age,
you actually don't have to sacrifice the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency when you're spectrum tuning,
you're actually gaining efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason, and well, I'm going to say
in 95% or more cases you are because
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency is usually gained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's some major things that play
a role in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diodes, the bin of the diodes,
the quantity of the diodes, the driver
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're using, the efficiency on the
driver, obviously the heat sinks and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything play a role too, but mainly
it's the driver and the diodes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that's going to play basically a
major role.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have spectrum tuning lights,
I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like we have a light that's got 5,310
diodes and one that's got 5,600 and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got ones in the 4,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of single channel lights and
most single channel lights have around a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are some that have up to a
3,000, but most of them are like a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have over double the diodes or
more, you're actually running way cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have a way longer life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's going to be more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases you're going to do other,
like if you wanted to replicate somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else's spectrum, you could do it,
but more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I do agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR is, it is more important, but when we
get to like a few percent, if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trading 5%, I definitely, I believe that
the optimized spectrum, like if I could
[SPEAKER_00]: choose between a blurple spectrum or,
or an optimized one and have 5% less
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency, like in 2025 quality is the
most important factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to come first over efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to transition over to UVC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is something that has been being
used more and more in indoor grow rooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: not for particular to initiate more plant
growth per se, but more for pest
[SPEAKER_01]: prevention and elimination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, I think in the next few
years, UVC will replace 90 to 95% of all
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, UV can be used to combat bugs,
to fight mold and to enhance THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we, this has been a long thing
that we've took us a really long time to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop, um, what's called the tarantula
predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically a UVC light that's used
to fight bugs is the main, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: the main reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've had a lot of R and D
on it and things have evolved a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's evolved to the point where we
can, it's immunity to thrips is what we
[SPEAKER_00]: call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a thrift infestation,
you can wipe them out in a little over a
[SPEAKER_00]: week by using 10 Watts per 16 square feet
for 15 minutes a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which is, it is pretty, it's pretty
crazy because in all my experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's impossible to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to be able to beat thrips without a
pesticide or predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually experimented with,
like, cause we've done a lot of controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: experiments where we're introducing
thrips, spider mites and all that types of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we try to combat thrips with
predator bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like one of the biggest, um,
kukumaris, swirski, hypoassis are three
[SPEAKER_00]: huge ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I forget the, a pirate bug is
another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, we would, we'd ask what the
recommended amount would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would order four times the amount
and introduce them to the room and not be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to beat thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe control them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, when you can compare the
efficacy, it's not even close.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually believe that using UVC for
five minutes a day has a higher efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: than using six or seven different predator
bugs as a prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it, we, it's not a cure to
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we actually, our very first test
that we did, we actually beat spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: when we were introduced, introducing two
to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got into tests where we're
introducing hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we weren't able to beat spider mites
when we were letting, introducing hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: to a plant and letting them establish for
36 hours, but we were able to slow them
[SPEAKER_00]: down by easily 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so like we have footage of like what
they can do in 36 hours and then treating
[SPEAKER_00]: it for 10 minutes a day and then jumping
ahead a week later and being able to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's really life changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it basically breaks the rules of
growing when we were developing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that there's a lot of bad
information out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, UVC can be extremely dangerous,
but so can sticking your hand in a blender
[SPEAKER_00]: while it's turned on, you know,
so like, uh, if anything can be really
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I think that so many people have
been scared about, or like scared from all
[SPEAKER_00]: this bad information about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with actually other people's bad
research slowed down our stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not even bad research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came across people actually faking
their research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we tried simulating
exactly what they were doing, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: showing spider web, spider mite
infestations with webbing and then showing
[SPEAKER_00]: it seven days later, clean and showing
that they were only using the light for a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big obstacle because we were
trying these treatments and not able to
[SPEAKER_00]: beat everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, okay, well, this person is
clearly faking their research and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why you don't know about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to go outside the box and we
started increasing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we actually first started using
using UVC, um, we were beating thrips by,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say 97 to 98% using a five minute
treatment in the middle of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people say middle of darkness,
they think, oh, Hermine, and they get
[SPEAKER_00]: scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not enough wattage to wake up the
plants and the light emits out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a big spotlight for insects
to come in and that they're attracted to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's kind of the theory on how it
kind of works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at five minutes a day, we were in
the top 33 to 30 inches, it would be hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to find any threat damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could only find stuff kind of
underneath where the lights aren't being
[SPEAKER_00]: treated or stuff where it was off to the
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it was really, um, what happened
is I had decided I wanted to try stressing
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants with UBC to enhance THC and
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided to do two 15 minute
treatments to see what would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, six days later, there were no more
threats and we could not find them
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's an IPM specialist named
Matthew Gates, who is based out of
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We flew him down to come and inspect the
room, um, just to see if he could find any
[SPEAKER_00]: threats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he spent a couple hours in
the room and like, he was able to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: see the footage too of when they were
introduced and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't being able to find anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also there's a fellow who's got a
YouTube channel named BC bubble man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we had known each other for a long
time, but we've kind of started hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: out from that, um, point.
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes a lot of macro footage and he's
into him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made inventor of the bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so he makes a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So him, he had a big interest in trying to
see if he could find any, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: any bug poo or anything, like anything
leftover from any type of the thrips on
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wasn't able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, after we had that crop,
we know that, Hey, we have broken the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've been at this my whole life and
you've never been able to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, um, and then,
then we also had something else happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we had a timer fail and I came into a
room and had all the plants just totally
[SPEAKER_00]: messed up and the, the lights were way
underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't even really close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we discovered that the UV
it's almost like systemically going into
[SPEAKER_00]: the STEM and able to stress out the whole
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, we believe, um, playing with these
limits are going to be able to push plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to get a higher terping and THC
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you use UVA, um, I participated,
well, I supplied a lot of lighting for a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of different side-by-sides where
people are going UVA versus not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they also did UVB versus not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very conclusive that the UVB
had such a higher efficacy where you saw a
[SPEAKER_00]: real gain on the CUA where UVA was almost
not nearly as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, there's just so little UVA,
like just in the, like even for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: in HBS, there's less than 0.2% UVA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the real gain is using
like, well, UVB or UVC for the future to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually push the limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of real COAs just to kind of like push the
absolute boundaries of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I believe anybody that's telling you
not to use it has never done any real
[SPEAKER_00]: research and they're just repeating what
other people have said about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So UVC you said five minutes per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the size of these lights and
wattage and where do you position the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually, um, came up with an idea
to make them float underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have a utility patent that
allows them to basically, you can get them
[SPEAKER_00]: at any level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every light that you have up above,
you have two five watt strips that are 44
[SPEAKER_00]: inches long and they're basically kind of
floating underneath the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can, you can, they spin 360
degrees and you can kind of get them
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like with certain, with like bad
spider mite infestations, we like to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: the fight right to them and getting the
lights as close as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with thrips, you actually don't need
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like on the very first crop that I had and
I was experimenting, I was chasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips around, like trying to get the
lights as close to anywhere where I saw it
[SPEAKER_00]: and moving them constantly where then,
you know, at the very end we accidentally
[SPEAKER_00]: wiped them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just tried using that from
underneath and discovered we don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: have to, we just have to have them mounted
underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I thought at first,
I remember asking Matthew Gates,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, do thrips have ears?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this UV putting off a sound?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know that, you know,
it, you know, the first six inches is
[SPEAKER_00]: where it really penetrates, but for
whatever reason, um, it's able to give the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it eradicates them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're working with multiple
universities on a get on white paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have a lot of real data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now that's just a theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like, that was just, I didn't know
what was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like on the very first crop, I actually
thought that we disabled them from being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to reproduce and then they died out
and they just died out by the end is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we just have too many examples of
just coming in and cleaning out a room
[SPEAKER_00]: that's got a bad grip infestation in eight
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a, it's just super effective
against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, it's like, almost like the
cure for cancer for plants, because even
[SPEAKER_00]: if, um, to be able to slow down,
like to, to mess up a plants or a insects
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA and RNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when you scoop the RNA, it's like
how they're thinking and how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: communicating and how they're,
they don't act normally after their RNA is
[SPEAKER_00]: screwed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and we have some really cool
documentation of, you know, after treating
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites and you see, you see them
after there had been before they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: treated and then you see them seven days
later and they're just all sitting there
[SPEAKER_00]: all slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not doing what they're supposed to
be doing, setting up shop and just going
[SPEAKER_00]: like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually think it's a block bigger than
medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like food crops, stuff like,
for like greenhouses, eat strawberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make, it's going to make an
impact on, um, eliminating pesticides or
[SPEAKER_00]: like playing a critical role in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that sounds like a complete game
changer for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I personally struggle with fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this work on fungus gnats too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've had a lot of reports of it
being extremely effective, but I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: be extremely conservative before I say,
Hey, this is going to wipe something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's very safe to say it's
going to make combating anything a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's, um, what they work very well for
flying rear David, but we actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: tested them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was someone that what's really
incredible is when the lights go out and
[SPEAKER_00]: you turn on the predator, the flying rude
aphids land right on the predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a best case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come right to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got documented footage of them all
like sitting all across predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a fellow that did this for
three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a couple of days later had them
completely dead everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now rude aphids, um, are, could be
impossible to beat like that because like
[SPEAKER_00]: an adult can spend the whole, its whole
life in the medium still, like just,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have to leave, but it's just,
um, I believe for a flying anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: is flying, it brings them to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing with predator bugs,
why predator bugs would be a waste of
[SPEAKER_00]: money because you're going to just,
you're going to wipe them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to screw up their RNA and
DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not functioning properly
anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned you run them during
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why wouldn't you run them during the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just because it's so much easier for
the bugs to see it because while the light
[SPEAKER_00]: is on, it's a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the lights are out, even though
it's so low wattage to her eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just like they're attracted to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I came across, um, like this is a
video done years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's talking about UV and that how
insects see UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I actually really like having them
like, say if you've got an entrance to a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, having these in like a bunch of
just the doorways of the entrance so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use them multiple times in the
middle of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if something does come in, you have a
good chance of disabling them from being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to reproduce already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they do make it in the room,
they do die out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I stand by like, I think that,
um, you know, it's, it's just like
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit to catch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we, we, we sell a lot every single
day and I believe it's just evolving to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like in all my years of growing,
what is the worst thing to do when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody hates spraying pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of nice when I guess if it's
like an essential oil that smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes you smell like a spa afterwards
would be about the one exception,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's very many or very little
products that are like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's one of the worst things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to just, um, like I still think there's
always going to be a place to use
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oils with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like there's it's because it's
friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't hurt the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you can pass any type of testing
when you're using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a, cause the bottom line is
alcohol with essential oils can just kill
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of stuff on combat, like on contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just using that the day that you plant
or the day before you flip, even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see anything, um, I still,
I still recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it sounds like the UVC definitely
makes things a lot easier when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: pest elimination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to try it out for
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had some technical difficulties.
[SPEAKER_01]: My internet actually went out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a brand new day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those of you watching on YouTube see that
I'm in new clothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to address that first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's pick up the conversation where we
left off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into under canopy lighting
next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is something that seems like more
and more people are talking about and more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more people are using over recent
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us all about under canopy
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing that when it first came
out, we were kind of, I wasn't so sure
[SPEAKER_00]: about it just because of the science of it
and light shooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, but we have so many different
clients that after using it, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: like we've had dozens and dozens of
clients that we're using it and just the
[SPEAKER_00]: results are actually kind of mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, um, really safe to say that
if you're a skilled grower, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to make a 20 to 40% gain in your yield in
the same square footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time turn C's into B's,
turn B's into A's and correct that
[SPEAKER_00]: discoloration throughout your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause anybody knows when you're harvesting
how it's just so, um, the color is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the other flip side of that is
like, when you're also harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you realize that the plant is all dead and
not doing well underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it actually does is giving that
added heat basically almost stabilizes the
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD and just makes your plants just way
more happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always wondered if it was actually
worth it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And seeing 20 to 40% gain is pretty
significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a lot of commercial growers
are introducing it because of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but how about home growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those folks that have just, you know,
a four by four or four by eight tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you still say it's worth it for
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, especially if you have multiple tents,
just testing one, anybody that I have seen
[SPEAKER_00]: that's ever added them in has continued to
keep on adding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually believe that the future could
be more of a less wattage up top lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: on the side and underneath for really just
pushing the limits of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because basically, um, well we're about to
start doing a whole bunch of tests like we
[SPEAKER_00]: have under canopy lighting that's about to
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be really interesting to
be able to just even test 240 watts
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath with two bars versus four bars
dimmed down to 240 watts to kind of see,
[SPEAKER_00]: does this make a difference giving
uniformity right through the middle and
[SPEAKER_00]: the sides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because another huge weakness in rooms is
upper side lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere, like if you have a big lit room,
well it's going to have awesome uniformity
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere until there's a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where that wall is it drops off
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having upper side lighting is going to
make, it's going to be a huge game changer
[SPEAKER_00]: for people in that sense too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all you have to do is just look on the
outside's part where you have a wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at your medicine, your medicine
flowers and then compare it to the other
[SPEAKER_00]: side and you'll see that it's just so much
weaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned 240 watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that per fixture?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's basically, um, it's a,
there are 120 watts per fixture and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been seeing people that actually add two
to three underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for most of the R&D that I've seen
it's been with two, but we've heard like
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have the power and depending on the
size of the plants, um, people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: had three, but that's some stuff that
we're also going to be doing trials with
[SPEAKER_00]: where we'll have two versus three,
um, two versus four, different wattages,
[SPEAKER_00]: same wattages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to just really see,
um, how far you can push it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have actually a client that can
actually get 10 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this sounds crazy, but actually
pulls 10 pounds per 16 square feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they grow vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they actually have lights all the way
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they actually have, they're,
they're pushing a lot of wattage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're limited to square footage,
but nothing in restricting them in height.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for that, the cost of the power,
um, it totally makes sense for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people with, like,
you know, with a lot of licensing,
[SPEAKER_00]: they come up with these really dumb rules
where it's, um, either plant counts or
[SPEAKER_00]: square footage and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically just, um, being able to
take advantage of it, of all the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And loopholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these 120 watt fixtures, how long are
they?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then where do you actually,
you place them underneath, but like how
[SPEAKER_01]: far away are they from the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, so there's a lot of different
designs that actually out of over the 30
[SPEAKER_00]: fixtures that we've made, we spent more
time designing this and we actually had
[SPEAKER_00]: four different, um, molds and we kept on
kind of going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually started with a plastic,
um, housing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still aluminum inside, but we started
with plastic just for the risk of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just kept on, um, then,
you know, I, at the last, I saw a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people coming out with aluminum and glass,
and then we wanted to do it aluminum and
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we ran into issues with,
if a driver, when you're not using a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-isolated driver, and if it ever fails
and it's attached to aluminum,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could cause a shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to come up with a different way
to make it really safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we decided to make it seamless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most under canoply have like a seamless
connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just plugs in nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can go the whole way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we came up with a floating design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people have it where it's mounted,
like to some sort of thing or resting on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we had it, so it's a way of making
them float.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we tested that, we used some
really high powered fans and we,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to kind of see how it could handle
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we noticed that having a seamless
connection looked like a warranty
[SPEAKER_00]: nightmare for us because you get a little
bit of pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've seen and heard from other
people is actually other competitors or
[SPEAKER_00]: some people are having issues because
pressure on those where the connections
[SPEAKER_00]: are and it's causing lights to turn on and
all different types of issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but ours are 44 inches basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have like a little connection so
that you can just continue to daisy chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of eliminates that one part of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I'm going to have to check it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds promising as far as the results
that people are getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was actually one other thing
that I could add to about the under
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people like to use or
majority of the industry uses a heavy deep
[SPEAKER_00]: red spectrum because it's highly
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I actually believe is that it
actually penetrates through the leaf and
[SPEAKER_00]: is getting caught because there's no other
explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because clearly when you're shooting,
the light is not hitting from above.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've criticized deep red spectrums in the
past, but I do think there's a place for
[SPEAKER_00]: them when it comes to under canopy and
also when it comes into like greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: situation because with greenhouse,
you have even on a cloudy day,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have all different types of
supplemental light that fills in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if it looks like on paper,
when you're looking at it, like it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: a thin spectrum or very small outside,
it's actually filled in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can imagine that some of these new
folks who are implementing these,
[SPEAKER_01]: they could be potentially making mistakes
with this because it is so new.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for going into details on how
big the lighting is wattage, distance,
[SPEAKER_01]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, speaking of mistakes, there are a lot
of mistakes that new folks and new growers
[SPEAKER_01]: can make that relate to lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about some of those and
how they can be corrected or avoided for
[SPEAKER_01]: better results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the biggest mistakes that's
made with LED lighting is intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like less is more in so many different
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being able to measure the light is
really, really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem is there's so many tools
for measuring the light that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them don't read far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them can read like 200 to 300
PPFD less than it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like having something like an Apogee
meter that can read from 400 to 750
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometer that can pick up the full
spectrum, it's priceless because just to
[SPEAKER_00]: put yourself in an optimum situation for
every single stage, down from like a baby
[SPEAKER_00]: to a seedling, like 100 to 120 PPFD is
just like the perfect level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from going into a teens,
200 to 250 is a great spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in vegging, I actually love 350 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just a beautiful sweet spot
that the plants love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see much of a reason to go over
500 in any real situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I see people with really large plants
that try to like want to give them a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like if you're not using
supplemental CO2 staying below 800 PPFD is
[SPEAKER_00]: really, it's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like if you use too much light,
the plants, there's a lot of times we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you almost right away by just using
slightly too much, you can get purple
[SPEAKER_00]: striping overnight on your stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use way too much, you know,
you can get the whole thing purple
[SPEAKER_00]: overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also seen where the plants like to do
like a talking where the leaves outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves will start closing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're trying to do is they're
trying to close and protect themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: from the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just being able to measure the
intensity in every single stage will
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize it and up your game huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've done consulting for some very
big large companies and it's so rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only think of a couple of times in
my life when I've come into a room and
[SPEAKER_00]: measured the PPFD and it's been bang on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either been too intense where it's
hurting them or they're leaving me on the
[SPEAKER_00]: table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you like, if you have, if you're
only hitting 600 or 700 PPFD in a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial setting, you are way under what
the true potential you could be yielding
[SPEAKER_00]: would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've definitely made that mistake in the
past where I just burnt the crap out of my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from too high of light and at dimming
it down, not only is it reducing the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of intensity that your plants are
getting, your plants aren't struggling at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point, but it's expanding the life of
the fixture, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're running it at less than the full
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, when I go back years
and years ago, I realized that,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we were having issues with light
intensity in veg and we didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: because we had these huge plants and they
were way too close to the lights and we
[SPEAKER_00]: were blaming everything else, but the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned measuring PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I wanted to ask you
about, get your thoughts on those phone
[SPEAKER_01]: apps that do PAR measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you familiar with any of those or are
they accurate or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am actually, and you know what,
now that I think about it, I'm just gonna,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can quickly look at what it's called
because there's one out of all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: that I find works better than the rest and
it's called PPFD meter grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I find what's really weird about
it is cause you have all different options
[SPEAKER_00]: to put different types of spectrums and
sunlight and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stock option that comes at,
that says sunlight with 6,500 K seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: work the closest to an Apogee meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, and I'm, this is based off using
an Android phone, but we've seen anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: from like around a hundred, usually around
a hundred to 150 PPFD within it with an
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the one that I like to go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for whatever reason, like,
if you put it on what the spectrum would
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be closest to, it does not read
accurately, but for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight at 6,500 K seems to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would take that all day,
every day over not using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's just, it's so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you start measuring it,
you can't stop because you can just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just giving you that extra edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally haven't had a chance to mess
around with any of the phone apps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an Apogee meter myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a couple different, the Apogee
meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard the spot on meter was pretty good
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, dialing in that light distance,
it can be so important and having a par
[SPEAKER_01]: meter, although they are expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think I spent over 500 bucks for
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps dial things in and make sure that
you're not giving too much light to your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like you said, not enough to where
you're leaving some meat on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to actually transition over and
ask a question, not really related to
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting, but more so of your personal
preference, strains, getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: particular strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Name the top three strains that you've
grown and what you liked about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're in Canada where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a big issue with renaming
cultivars or like someone having the same
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because I say a name does not
necessarily mean it is the exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the one cultivar that I had the most
experience with and I had over probably 20
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons on YouTube at one point growing
with was Death Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have close to a hundred runs with
this cultivar and I monocropped it across
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple facilities for over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, and a lot of people,
a lot of my American friends that tried it
[SPEAKER_00]: would say, oh, this is heavy OG lineage
with a touch of cookies and a little
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a special cultivar that I just,
I'd done very, very well for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had tried hunting for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like on in certain places, trying to find
something to replace it into my whole
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't ever find anything to replace
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another one that was a master
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, like there's so many different
MKs and MKUs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a special one that had a very
high level of THCV, the highest levels
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had ever seen in anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was also very unique about this
cultivar, it didn't get any purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just go yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no purple no matter what you
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime when someone tried to say,
hey, I've got this, I could tell instantly
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's not because it's got purple in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely not the cultivar that
I'm looking with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a special cultivar and I lost
it and it hurt when I lost it because I
[SPEAKER_00]: loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't throw it as much because I was
getting the same, or it didn't yield as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as Death Bubba, but it was worth
about the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it came down to a financial reasons why
we weren't throwing it back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one is an old school one
that goes back to the late 90s that was
[SPEAKER_00]: the original BC Hash Plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're from Canada, or even I would say
a lot of people in California would have
[SPEAKER_00]: had the BC Hash Plant in the early 2000s
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just this beautiful cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way I know how to explain it is
it just coats your mouth with this flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told that it was a cross between an
Afghan and a Northern Lights cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that we grew it a couple of times
and I knew multiple people that grew it
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years and it just died out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would consider it the most valuable
cultivar out there in the world right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pay big bucks to be able to get a
cut of it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been asking that question recently
because there's a lot of folks here that
[SPEAKER_01]: are shopping for genetics and asking the
guests here what their favorites are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely allows people to do some
research, maybe pick up some things for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we end this, I do want to ask
you what the future looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You work in the lighting industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been in there for a while now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've clearly had a passion for it for a
very, very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people say that lighting has kind
of topped out now and there's really not
[SPEAKER_01]: much further it can go.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are people that debate
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think the future looks like
for the lighting industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think just like everything,
it's evolving quick and I believe spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: tuning is coming in a big way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at this point, it's already evolved
where you can get a spectrum tuning light
[SPEAKER_00]: for the same price as a single channel
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think that that is a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think UVC is coming in a big way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same with UVB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows the worst part of any type
of job when it comes to cultivation is
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying and just eliminating that and the
contaminations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that is a huge way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using UVB to enhance your COAs is going to
be a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under Canopy, it's making things a lot
more profitable for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's coming in a big way.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are resisting it and it's
kind of funny because once you see them
[SPEAKER_00]: try it, they're right on board right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's kind of like the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you foresee AI getting involved in
lighting at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I have talked about
on a podcast in the past is how cool would
[SPEAKER_01]: it be if your lights actually had some
sort of sensor to where they could see the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and detect if they were some sort
of problem, like too much light,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, and then it would
automatically adjust and send you an
[SPEAKER_01]: alert.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different things
AI-wise that probably could be
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporated into the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you foresee anything like that
happening soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how soon, but I already know
it's already started.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is AI that's coming that can analyze
the plants and if there's any type of
[SPEAKER_00]: disease or anything going on, it's going
to report it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is so much to do with
spectrum tuning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, just to find the true potential of
each cultivar by using different
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having AI incorporated in that and
playing a part in it, I think it is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in a big way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be able to catch something when
there's a problem way before it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the name of a company,
but I've already heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very expensive unit where it's some
sort of camera system that goes back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth and takes imaging and it's able to
track, like find if you've got bugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing a really good job and it's a
subscription.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that much information,
but I was recently hearing someone telling
[SPEAKER_00]: me about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going, wow, that's really taking
things to another level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing with big tractors where
they're using electricity and zapping
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more innovative ways,
I think, of treating insects and combating
[SPEAKER_00]: different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's breakthroughs on fighting mold and
AI, I think, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to play a major role.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would probably make things a
lot easier for gardeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we are getting up to the hour mark
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, we might have already passed it,
but we wanted to wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the listener how they can
find you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I do have a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been probably over 1,500 videos
removed from it at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is alive still with a grand master
level on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Instagram, it's grand master level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we have some pretty cool
collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually working with Merculis from
Death Row Records.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a Canadian artist and we're actually
making Mercs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are these glasses right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a really high quality pair
of glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually licensed the same frames that
Prada is using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you awesome protection against
the sun and the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in there, you've got to protect your
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, these lights are so bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really exciting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we have upcoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also been working on a UVB,
UVA bar that controls them both
[SPEAKER_00]: independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be an add-on to every light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping to have that done in a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also been working on a microgreen
kit where I actually had an idea to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: light fit in a 10 inch or a set of lights
fit in a 10 inch by 20 inch tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you can get four trays come
with it and the light folds out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere where you have a two by four
space, you're going to be able to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: microgreens.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come up with a new medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, that's a cloth that's actually
mold and UV resistant that you can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the hardest things with microgreens
is mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the other equation to that is it's
going to come with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it stands right now, there's a couple
of companies that almost have a monopoly
[SPEAKER_00]: in the United States when it comes to
microgreen seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try to end that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're not trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to end that and we're going
to make it way more affordable so when
[SPEAKER_00]: someone buys it, they can grow crop after
crop after crop and be really affordable
[SPEAKER_00]: for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we have coming up in the next
few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely some exciting things there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask you about your YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember you having tons and tons of
videos and I wasn't sure if they canceled
[SPEAKER_01]: one channel and you had to start a new one
or what happened there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember when it was like
everybody's channel was getting deleted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a point where I did 111 live
streams in a row where we would have over
[SPEAKER_00]: a 500 person live audience, 111 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I used to put a video within 24 hours,
I'd get 5,000 to 10,000 views and when
[SPEAKER_00]: then it all started, I just started almost
everybody I knew was losing their channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when Envy Closet Medgrower lost his
channel, at that time, so we just started
[SPEAKER_00]: removing everything and then going back to
Zoom and then I've never been able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: it re-monetized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just started a new channel too,
also Grand Master LEDs that we were going
[SPEAKER_00]: to just try to do things because anytime I
do something, getting complaints that,
[SPEAKER_00]: say I've been removed or I'm not getting a
notification or like I can't reach anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: on it, it's pretty frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is super frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a rough time back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that most people got their
channels back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think 100% of the people got their
channels back, but most did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we can only hope it gets better
from there, but I'll definitely have a
[SPEAKER_01]: link to Thomas's YouTube channel down in
the YouTube description section below so
[SPEAKER_01]: you can easily get to it and subscribe to
his channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give a big thanks to the folks
supporting on Patreon, patreon.com slash
[SPEAKER_01]: MrGrowit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks being scrolled on the screen
right now are in the producer tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Special thanks to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You helped keep this podcast going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Thomas, once again, thanks so much
for coming onto this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been very insightful for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely going to have to replay
this and make sure I'm grasping onto all
[SPEAKER_01]: the information that was thrown through
this episode here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, man, appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasure and honor and I'm
looking forward to doing something in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, everyone, we'll leave it at
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out.
