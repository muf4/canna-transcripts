[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening, and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're tuned in to the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 107.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Brandon Rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for 20 years,
and is the owner of Bokashi Earthworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may remember Brandon from
episode 16 of this podcast, where he
[SPEAKER_00]: talked all about utilizing microorganisms
in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, he talks about several
different garden amendments, why they
[SPEAKER_00]: would be applied, and the pros and cons of
using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is now a separate channel called
Garden Talk Clips on YouTube, where these
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast episodes are broken down into
highlights or smaller clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply search Garden Talk Clips on
YouTube, and the channel should pop right
[SPEAKER_00]: up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to acknowledge that one of my goals
for this podcast is to bring free
[SPEAKER_00]: information about gardening all plants to
the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Mars Hydro for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out their spring sowing sale,
which is going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing 15% off some of their LED
grow lights, such as the TS series and SP
[SPEAKER_00]: series.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5

[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights, and humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The discount code MRGROWIT15 works on both
Amazon and their website, ACInfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Brandon Rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your second time on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time around was episode 16 back
in May of 2021, so quite a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked all about utilizing
microorganisms in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so much great information in
that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got over 63,000 listens on YouTube
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've definitely touched a lot of lives
in that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to get into
various garden amendments, why they would
[SPEAKER_00]: be applied, and the pros and cons of using
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you introduce yourself for
those that didn't catch the first episode
[SPEAKER_00]: we did together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For any of your listeners who aren't
familiar with myself, my name is Brandon
[SPEAKER_01]: Rust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I specialize in agronomy and microbiology
for medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also work with people who do food
production and all types of other types of
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I own Bokashi Earthworks, and we have a
couple of different things that we do at
[SPEAKER_01]: Bokashi Earthworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that we are ramping
up and starting to do on a larger scale is
[SPEAKER_01]: our green waste recycling program,
where we take organic waste from other
[SPEAKER_01]: industries and we convert those into
biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biological fertilizers through a process
of salt state fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have touched a little bit about
that on the last episode that we did
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also manufacture a product called
MicroPlus here in Oklahoma City at the
[SPEAKER_01]: office.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a consortium of
microorganisms, fungus, yeast,
[SPEAKER_01]: and bacteria that is used for
bioremediation, for nutrient cycling,
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen suppression, has a bunch of
different applications across agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: remediation, and even it is used in
livestock industry as well as a probiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also sell bulk soils, amendments,
and humate fertilizers that were developed
[SPEAKER_01]: by NASA Agricultural Technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a lot of different aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just opened up our Bokashi Earthworks
Learning Center, where you can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: come in person on our scheduled days and
you can learn about different subjects
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to what we're doing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're doing, we're gonna be talking
about organic amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have classes on solid state
fermentation, different practical
[SPEAKER_01]: applications of microorganisms in
gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a lot of different things that
we cover and we'll be making more
[SPEAKER_01]: schedules and more events as the year
progresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also have guest speakers such as Dr.
Pepper Hernandez and some other people
[SPEAKER_01]: doing some KNF classes as well,
some natural farming classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of bundled everything together
because the biggest hurdle that I found
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to breaking into
conventional agriculture is the education
[SPEAKER_01]: is greatly needed before people will put
their faith in doing something new,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when it comes to, you know,
when we're talking about the American
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer, one of the things that a lot of
times they face is the fact that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these people are actually mortgaging their
land and their property to get the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that they need to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they always typically go with what
has worked in the past and that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: replicatable because their livelihoods are
on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if something goes wrong, they could be
out everything, their whole family's
[SPEAKER_01]: livelihood and their business and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of the things that a lot of
people don't understand about how American
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture works, but they do a lot of
labor, not a great return and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: times they're putting everything on the
line to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to make sure that the people
who are switching over to these types of
[SPEAKER_01]: programs really understand the way that
they operate and the practical application
[SPEAKER_01]: that's behind the science so that way they
can achieve the success that they need to
[SPEAKER_01]: be profitable and maintain a sustainable
agricultural model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that you not only have good
products, but a big focus here is the
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're not shy and holding back
information, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to educate the community and
that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not a lot of people will be open
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they just want to sell their
products and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really care about the education
side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just going on your Instagram
alone, I know before we start recording,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd mentioned that you're not able to
really keep up with as much as you like,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's a lot of great information in
regards to the science behind the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and things that can be useful in the
garden in order to grow these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll definitely have a link to his
Instagram down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you tuning in on YouTube,
highly recommend you give him a follow
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's great information on that
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so getting into the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you gave me a list of amendments prior
to recording here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ask to begin, are all these
amendments that you're about to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: organic or are some synthetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so let's talk about what organic is.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, because there's some
misunderstandings about organic versus
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could have, and also natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in most people's minds, when they hear
organic, they are thinking about a
[SPEAKER_01]: practice, you know, using things that are
naturally around them, things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that, I consider, you know,
natural farming where you're using where
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is pretty much organic,
but here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What organic truly means is carbon-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were to approach any,
any institution, any type of scientist or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else, and you're talking about
organic, it means that it is carbon-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some of the things that we use in
agriculture don't contain carbon,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they are natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like gypsum, for instance,
which is calcium, calcium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's a natural component.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes right out of the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an abundance of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easily accessible, and it doesn't
have any negative impacts on the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment when it's applied correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even, and also I want to make
sure people understand just because
[SPEAKER_01]: something is considered organic doesn't
necessarily mean safe either, because
[SPEAKER_01]: there are things that are organic that are
also they're not safe, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you're over-applying something,
it can still have a detrimental impact to
[SPEAKER_01]: the environment or people around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we're talking about organic in
this context, we're talking about both
[SPEAKER_01]: meals, those are usually organic inputs,
and then you have things that are natural,
[SPEAKER_01]: like your rock minerals, and then you also
have natural salts, like Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a natural occurring mineral,
and it is a salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what a salt is, it's just a,
it's a cation, an element with a negative,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a positive charge attached to an
anion, which is an element with a negative
[SPEAKER_01]: charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens is it just means that
negative and positive attract,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so they've attracted, they've created
a covalent bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a very strong bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they disassociate in the presence
of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we're looking at something
like gypsum or copper sulfate or iron
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfate, there's, these things are
natural, they come from the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are not synthetically produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the difference between organic and
natural, so we're using things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: organic and natural, we're not using
things that are synthetically created,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that come from the Herbert Botch
process of creating nitrogen from,
[SPEAKER_01]: from gas, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's just, and then, you know,
some of the synthetics, if you were to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about like DAP, diammonium phosphate,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're essentially mixing ammonium and
phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what, the way that that would work is
you would take a natural mineral element
[SPEAKER_01]: that contains phosphorous, you're
attacking that parent apatite material
[SPEAKER_01]: with something like phosph, like with
sulfuric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does is it releases the
anion that we were mentioning,
[SPEAKER_01]: that phosphorous anion from that parent
apatite material, it liberates that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're able to separate that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they take that phosphorous,
and then they mix that with the ammonium
[SPEAKER_01]: that was made during the Herbert Botch
process, and they get, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: mono ammonium or diammonium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, those things take a lot of energy and
resources to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're looking at these and
going, hey, this may not be the best way
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it, because of the resources
allocated to the production of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not, and also, like if they're
used properly, or if they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have less of a detrimental impact,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, but the problem is that even when
you create something like diammonium
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphate, which has really high nitrogen
value and a really high phosphorous value,
[SPEAKER_01]: those things are both biologically
mediated, right, naturally in systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, as soon as you put that down,
you're gonna lose nitrogen immediately,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it, it goes through a process that
is mediated by biology, and some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: can off gas back into the atmosphere as
atmospheric nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it will be leached away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a very low nutrient use
efficiency, so even though you're putting
[SPEAKER_01]: high numbers on there, maybe like 42%
phosphorous in this case, not all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: is gonna be available.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is as soon as that is
liberated, both that cation from the
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonium and that anion from the
phosphorous, those are liberated,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so now you have a highly, highly
reactive anion that doesn't stay in that
[SPEAKER_01]: form freely in nature for very long,
and so what it does is it attaches to
[SPEAKER_01]: other positively charged particles in the
soil, and so it can tie up things like
[SPEAKER_01]: iron and calcium and zinc and manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can tie up these other elements,
making them unavailable to the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so you're essentially, the thinking
is, oh, I'm adding in a bunch of this
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral nutrient, but what you're actually
doing is you're causing a chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction when those things disassociate
and are liberated within that system where
[SPEAKER_01]: they start to tie up other things,
making the things that were already there
[SPEAKER_01]: that were available become unavailable,
and so there's a bunch of chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: reactions that are happening, and there
are biological reactions that are mediated
[SPEAKER_01]: during these processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, carbon, phosphorous,
sulfur, nitrogen, and iron are all very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very highly biologically mediated in these
soil systems, and so we have the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle, we have the phosphorous cycle,
we have the carbon and sulfur cycles,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then iron is a whole different beast
in itself when we're talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: natural acquisition of iron into the plant
is because iron, you know, it oxidizes so
[SPEAKER_01]: rapidly in the pH ranges that these plants
are usually optimally operating in,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then also in the presence of water
because the water is an oxidizing agent,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so it gives off its hydrogen ions to
that ferric iron and causes it to oxidize
[SPEAKER_01]: into Fe3+, which isn't really available to
a lot of plants, and so with biology,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have things like the production of
amino acids and sidiophores that can keep
[SPEAKER_01]: that iron in a metabolically available
form, so there's all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient interactions that are happening
and so when we're talking about synthetics
[SPEAKER_01]: versus natural, we have these anions that
are in great abundance that start to tie
[SPEAKER_01]: up stuff, but also they acidify the
organic matter that's already there,
[SPEAKER_01]: causing a reduction in the amount of total
organic matter, and we need, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: about 5% is ideal for, you know,
ideal crop production and for these
[SPEAKER_01]: biologically mediated processes to be able
to continue to happen, and the less
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage that we go under that,
the less biological mediated processes are
[SPEAKER_01]: happening, so we have to add continuously
more and more and more, and this compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: the problem over time, and so when we're
looking at things that are naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: derived or organically derived,
we still have to look at the application
[SPEAKER_01]: rates, we still have to be responsible in
the timing, the when,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the where, you know, we have to be
mindful of the application still,
[SPEAKER_01]: however, these things are usually less
resource dependent, and they're also less
[SPEAKER_01]: energy dependent, and then they're less
environmentally impactful, or they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have an environmental impact, that's gonna
be negative, usually we'll have a positive
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental aspect to it, because with
an organic amendment, like a meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll divide these up, we have meals
which are going to be a slower release,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll get some nutrient availability
right away when you apply those,
[SPEAKER_01]: but things like alfalfa meal, soybean
meal, blood meal, bone meal, guanos,
[SPEAKER_01]: those types of things, they'll take a
little bit, up to three or four weeks to
[SPEAKER_01]: be completely broken down, now,
so those are all organic, and so when
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about organic amendments,
I'm usually talking about meals
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically, because those are a carbon
based organic substrate that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: takes the breaking down of that material
for whatever's in there to be released
[SPEAKER_01]: into the system and become metabolically
available for the plant, and the bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: and fungi in the soil, then there are the
rock minerals, that you have things like
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium phosphate, azomite, you have,
you know, glacial rock dusts, you have
[SPEAKER_01]: those type of things that are usually
going to increase your cation exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity, your ECE, of your soil,
it's usually going to bring in some type
[SPEAKER_01]: of calcium source, some type of
phosphorus, usually, and then trace
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals, and then you have your natural
salts, right, things like epsom salt,
[SPEAKER_01]: gypsum, oh, also, step back, in those rock
minerals, we also have things like calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: silica, and also, liming agents that will
help with pH, then we get into natural
[SPEAKER_01]: salts, epsom salt, gypsum, which is
calcium sulfate, we have all the mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfates that are all naturally occurring,
potassium sulfate, and then all the
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrient sulfates, and then also for
boron, either borax or solubor,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is sodium borate, which is another
naturally occurring salt, and again,
[SPEAKER_01]: these things aren't detrimental in the
systems, but you do still have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: mindful of what you're adding in,
because you're looking for sufficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're also looking for balance
between all the elements, and so,
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference between all of those
elements is that three to four weeks on
[SPEAKER_01]: the organic meals, usually, you'll have
some mineral availability in the rock
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals, like, you know, calcium silica,
you'll get the silica and calcium,
[SPEAKER_01]: a nice portion of that is available,
and then you have your salts, salts are
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately available, and so what happens
is they disassociate when you put them in
[SPEAKER_01]: water, some of them will react with other
elements, so that's one of the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to be mindful of, if you have a
cation, it's gonna be attracted to an
[SPEAKER_01]: anion, so that's why the sulfate,
the sulfate is the anion in all the
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral sulfates, and then all the rest of
them are all cations, so whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: zinc, copper, manganese, magnesium,
or calcium, they all have a sulfate state
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can be in, those disassociate in
water, and they're metabolically available
[SPEAKER_01]: right away, so you can add epsom salt,
gypsum, and all your iron sulfate,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the things that you can do when
you're adding these into your system is
[SPEAKER_01]: you can add humic and fulvic acids,
and that'll help them stay in a
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolically available form, because just
because they are available, they change,
[SPEAKER_01]: things change, in real time, some things
will bond with this, the plant will take
[SPEAKER_01]: some stuff up, some of the biology will
use it and immobilize it for the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then that'll have to cycle to be
released again, so a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff happens, but out of all of those
natural compounds, the mineral salts will
[SPEAKER_01]: always be more available, you'll always
have a higher availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting, yeah, I'm glad we went
over this first, because it's definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be helpful as we go along here,
because we're gonna be talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: salts, we're gonna be talking about meals,
and so on and so forth, so let's start
[SPEAKER_00]: going down this list now, calcium
silicate, talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my absolute favorites, so calcium
is a it's considered a secondary nutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for a lot of medicinal plants and a
lot of heavy fruiting plants, calcium will
[SPEAKER_01]: actually be about second or third as far
as the amount that it'll store in the
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue, and the amount that it'll actually
uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium mediates so many different
aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: This particular element, it works really,
really well to stabilize pH, so if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a low pH, it's not gonna have as fast
of an acting time to increase,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not just gonna make it jump up from
5.5 to 6.5, it's more of a slow jump,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's not as fast acting as something
like high calcium agline, or even
[SPEAKER_01]: something like dolomite lime, which will
jump it up a little higher, faster,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the benefit is that you get the
calcium and the benefit of the silica as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, and although silica is not
considered an essential plant nutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: as it's not needed to complete the plant's
entire life cycle, it's kind of something
[SPEAKER_01]: that really aids in a lot of other aspects
that I'm not gonna get too much into,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, it's a rock mineral,
so some of it will be available,
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of it will be recycled
through different processes, through the
[SPEAKER_01]: biology and the soil, and it's one of my
favorites to actually front load calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: early in the vegetative state,
when plants are really starting to fill
[SPEAKER_01]: out and put on the green foliage and
everything else, and it helps with a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of different things, like chemical
messaging, signaling, it helps with really
[SPEAKER_01]: thickening up the cuticle growth,
layers on the leaf surface, which can help
[SPEAKER_01]: as a protectant from leaf eating insects,
and then it's also responsible for helping
[SPEAKER_01]: with the movement of other elements,
so it's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another calcium source that we would use,
and this one is actually a salt,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so it has more availability right
away, is gypsum or calcium sulfate,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's one of the other go-to mineral
elements that I use to get adequate levels
[SPEAKER_01]: of calcium, and there are a couple of
other things too that I'll use for
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium, but the calcium silicate and the
gypsum are the first when we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about calcium, because the other elements
that we're gonna talk about that have high
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of calcium in them also have
phosphorus and some micronutrients that
[SPEAKER_01]: are associated with them as well,
and so in the instance that I would not
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be adding in any more phosphorus,
if I had plenty of phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't need to bring any in,
or I didn't want to bring any other
[SPEAKER_01]: elements in and I was strictly addressing
calcium, I would only use the gypsum or
[SPEAKER_01]: the calcium silicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, bone meals, that is gonna be an
organic amendment, it does have carbon in
[SPEAKER_01]: it, and it also has a lot of calcium and a
lot of phosphorus, so in the instance that
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed to implement and get both
phosphorus, or maybe I didn't need
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus really, but it's not gonna hurt
me, it's not gonna hurt, because it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: organic meal, to add that extra,
because the way that it's gonna be broken
[SPEAKER_01]: down is gonna be really slow anyway,
so it's not going to have an extreme
[SPEAKER_01]: impact on other elements in the soil or
the soil biology, it's not gonna set
[SPEAKER_01]: anything out of balance with a bone meal,
unless you're using something like a fish
[SPEAKER_01]: bone meal, which you could bring in too
much and you have sodium, too much
[SPEAKER_01]: chloride, because it's an ocean input.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bone meal's really good calcium source,
you'll also have the phosphorus associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with it, there's some other stuff too,
that also has calcium, but you should be
[SPEAKER_01]: careful with, and that is going to be high
phosphorus sea bird guano, and typically,
[SPEAKER_01]: what people are using that for is for
phosphorus, it has a high availability of
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus and it's pretty quick to
release, even though this is an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: substance, so you can get the phosphorus
in there a lot faster with the guano,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you also have to remember that if
you're already loaded up on a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium already, it might not be something
that you would wanna add as your
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus supplement, simply because it's
probably gonna have something like 18 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 23% calcium also associated with it,
and when you're looking at a label,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a plant label, you have a part on
there that has your NPK, and your calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: and magnesium and all that stuff isn't
always gonna be on there, it might be
[SPEAKER_01]: listed on the back if it's listed at all,
and so from a consumer standpoint,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you know about your NPK and you're
trying to address something just for
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus, you're inadvertently adding
something that you may not want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: adding, so it's important to know exactly
what other elements are associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: the mineral amendments or the organic
meals that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in regards to bone meal, there's some
controversy behind it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a not the best source to
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think you're talking about it being
a byproduct from the slaughter industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the same can be said about things like
blood meal, but this is the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those industries aren't gonna stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are gonna continue to eat meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we should strive for ethically
sourced and we should, but that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: comes with our dollar, that comes with the
buying power of the consumer, so that
[SPEAKER_01]: falls on the consumer to get their meat
from producers who have ethic treatment of
[SPEAKER_01]: animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, all of the waste that
comes from any industry, if it were not
[SPEAKER_01]: recycled and used for some other purpose,
it's just going to go to waste,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so there's a controversy and there's a
conflict, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there are producers, and I'm not
using, we get all of our bone meal
[SPEAKER_01]: locally, so we know where it comes from,
and it's not these giant desert cattle
[SPEAKER_01]: farms that exist in New Mexico and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all Oklahoma and Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a product that's being recycled and
repurposed, and so it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: double-edged sword when it comes to it,
because yes, we need ethically sourced.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're not using the byproducts,
though, then they're going to waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, these industries exist, and they're
gonna create byproducts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not you, buy that type of meat
or that type of product, that's personal
[SPEAKER_01]: preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know as a company, and I'm into organic
waste recycling, that we're gonna take
[SPEAKER_01]: waste from the industries that we operate
with because we want to close those carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle loops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to get that carbon back into soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to promote regenerative farming
systems, and we want to be able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: things in a manner that is less
detrimental to our environment and to our
[SPEAKER_01]: own selves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not want to buy products,
if that's the case, but then you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at where the products are coming
from, where they're sourced from.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do all of our due diligence when it
comes to all of the inputs that we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to both our soil,
our compost, and all of the things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: sell to our consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move on down the line
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next one, I actually have in my
garden, and I use it quite a bit from Time
[SPEAKER_00]: Design, which is magnesium sulfate,
AKA Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, out of all the mineral sulfates,
it actually has the highest solubility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, a little goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically, when it comes to medicinal
crops, and even heavy flowering,
[SPEAKER_01]: fruiting crops, if you're doing,
like for me, when I do all of my
[SPEAKER_01]: home-grown stuff, I love to use magnesium
sulfate as a foiler spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use a tablespoon per gallon,
and the reason is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's really, really soluble,
you have four major soil cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be calcium, magnesium,
potassium, and sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always want sodium as low as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the other three, all those four
things, they're antagonistic to each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they need to be in balance so they can
be absorbed by the plant in the right
[SPEAKER_01]: ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we're talking about Epsom salt,
it's very soluble, and it can cause
[SPEAKER_01]: antagonisms with calcium and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over-applying it through a soil,
or through watering it in, unless you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing what I do with the agronomy,
and you're doing soil analytics,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing soil testing, saturated paste
testing, leaf tissue testing, and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just a home grower, you can kind
of avoid that situation that you might put
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself in by locking out some of that
other stuff by over-applying too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you might not know how much you
need to be applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just use it as a foil or spray,
you can avoid that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can avoid that negative chemical
interaction that would happen within the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, those antagonistic relationships
that could potentially be there with the
[SPEAKER_01]: misuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can just use a tablespoon per
gallon and spray it on the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's gonna have great, great efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now one of the things I do have to
mention, that whenever you're doing an
[SPEAKER_01]: application using a spray, you need to
start with clean water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like reverse osmosis,
or distilled water, because if you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: using clean water, you could have a lot of
sodium, or a lot of bicarbonate,
[SPEAKER_01]: or your pH could be really, really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it decreases the efficacy of what
you're trying to apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're using clean water,
you have a greater efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not any kind of negative
reactions, antagonisms that are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: happening because the water has high boron
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tablespoon per gallon is a little bit
different for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use a teaspoon per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like I need to up my dose a
little bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always use it as a foiler as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do it a couple times a week
even too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go and spray, and one day,
wait another day, spray again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't recommend doing more than three
times a week, but that is a really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really great way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that I see pretty
consistently across the board,
[SPEAKER_01]: and your leaf margins, they'll start to
show a little shadowing in between the
[SPEAKER_01]: veins, where there'll kind of be a slight
discoloration.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the very first sign,
but the leaf petiole will actually start
[SPEAKER_01]: to turn purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you start there, you can do your
foiler sprays, and you can kind of avoid
[SPEAKER_01]: all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing about magnesium is it's a
photosynthetic element.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the center of every chlorophyll
molecule is gonna be magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need it for chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the plants to photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be a really limiting factor,
especially in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do not have enough magnesium,
everything else is gonna slow down because
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant doesn't have the ability to
photosynthesize or create more chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_01]: in the chloroplast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're never doing a foiler and
flowering, is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Up to about week two you can during the
bolting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I try not to spray anything after
we've had flower sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing that I spray is usually
around day 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do my pruning on my plants that need
to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bottom, prune up all the stuff,
whether it's medicinal herbs or even
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes and stuff like that, peppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prune all that stuff up, all that crap
on the bottom so the energy is at the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruiting sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll spray trichoderma and bacillus
subtilis as a combination, and it has so
[SPEAKER_01]: many benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has benefits as a source of oil drench,
but as a foiler application.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the last thing I spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's usually for the prevention of
things like botrytis and powdery mildew in
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps suppress any type of leaf-borne
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it also works as an endophyte.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will penetrate inside of the plant's
cell and it will help fight off any other
[SPEAKER_01]: type of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what we're doing is we're
inoculating the plant endosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the phylosphere to basically
out-compete other pathogens and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: give that extra layer of protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endophytes are super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole other episode itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get really deep into that, but it's
really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, the way that microbes work,
when you start understanding actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding microbial metabolism and
like what photosynthesis is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there are a lot of different
microorganisms that photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, photosynthesis in plants came
from bacteria that combine with their
[SPEAKER_01]: cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we're looking at chloroplasts,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their own sets of DNA and cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they replicate independently of the
plant cells themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's an ancient function of a
symbiotic relationship that became
[SPEAKER_01]: encapsulated into one system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're looking at microbial
metabolisms, we'll have to do that one
[SPEAKER_01]: another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium, you don't want too high a
magnesium actually going into flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, it's a photosynthetic element.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you have too much, it'll
actually decrease your, just like
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, it'll decrease your
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll decrease terpene expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can have some negative impact on
some of these herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: While on some other herbs, it'll have
positive impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like on tomatoes, you're gonna have better
health benefits if you have more
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium, more calcium, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on which specific crop
you're growing that these things,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're situational, you could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's move down the list a little
bit further here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are at soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so let's talk about both soybean
meal, alfalfa meal, blood meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: feather and antigen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And feather meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all nitrogen sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used pretty much for nitrogen
sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while they do contain small amounts of
other elements, typically we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: addressing, we're not gonna address iron
with soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not gonna address calcium with
soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although they have small amounts of that
in there, we're looking at these
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically for nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are nitrogen inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also biostimulants like amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be categorized into an organic
amendment as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that's more of a biostimulant and
it has much more beneficial properties
[SPEAKER_01]: than just the meals themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they operate a little differently on
the plant's metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we're talking about any of
these meals, they all take typically
[SPEAKER_01]: between three and four weeks to be
completely broken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get some solubility of nutrition
when you're applying it, but it's a slow
[SPEAKER_01]: release.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by week four, the majority,
I think for blood meal and feather meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's three weeks and 100% release of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the blood meal was at 14% blood meal
and you put it in a pound of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can figure out what the PPM of that is
by doing some mathematical conversions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can figure out, okay, so I'm
getting this much PPM of nitrogen over the
[SPEAKER_01]: next four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can kind of, that's how I know
how to do my application rates as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: when I'm looking at agronomic data and
giving people personal recommendations for
[SPEAKER_01]: their crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each one of those is a different one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soybean meal and alfalfa are going to be,
they're gonna be plant-based, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're gonna have slightly lower
nitrogen content than the animal-based
[SPEAKER_01]: products like the feather meal or the
blood meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are gonna have a higher nitrogen
value.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soybean meal, I really like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my go-tos.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is like one of my absolute go-tos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 7% nitrogen and it has about
three and a half week span to where it
[SPEAKER_01]: will be completely broken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It offers a little bit of a difference in
comparison to something like blood meal
[SPEAKER_01]: because the blood meal will have higher
ammonium concentrations in it as opposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to the soybean meal which has more complex
nitrogen source like amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has amino acids associated with it or
nitrogen that hasn't been broken down
[SPEAKER_01]: fully while the blood meal will have,
it has a higher nitrogen content and a
[SPEAKER_01]: higher amount of that nitrogen content is
gonna be in its ammonium form which means
[SPEAKER_01]: it's gonna be more readily available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you put that in, it will have way
more soyability than the other types of
[SPEAKER_01]: meals like soybean or alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alfalfa has actually a really,
really small, usually only one,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 2% nitrogen associated with it and
it has a slower release as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be a total release of maybe
like 75% over a four-week period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about kelp meal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you group that into that same
category or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at kelp meal, and this is one
of the things, I absolutely do not use
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: After all of the research that I've done,
kelp meal is a no-go and this is why.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I've looked at maybe 20 different
brands, suppliers of kelp meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is only one single company and that
is Espoma that has low arsenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So across the board, kelp is notorious for
arsenic contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Espoma had like 1.37 ppm.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the rest were between 20 to 30% ppm,
parts per million of arsenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great concern, especially when
we're talking about commercial production
[SPEAKER_01]: of food or medicine, especially in
medicinal herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to test these products and that
can be a huge problem for commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you look at the actual
nutrition of kelp, if you're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the NPK, it's usually less than 1% across
the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have 1% nitrogen, you might have
half of a percent or 0.25% phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe half a percent potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of kelp that you would need to
add into a system to bring that system to
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritional sufficiency would be
exponentially more detrimental because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the high heavy metals, the high sodium and
the high chloride content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all kelp has high sodium chloride,
sodium and chloride, because it's an ocean
[SPEAKER_01]: input.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all ocean inputs, well, there's oyster
shell, crustacean meal, fish bone meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: all those things have higher sodium
associated with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're adding a bunch of kelp,
if you're trying to add it in there to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring these systems, oh, I need my NPK
levels up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an adequate source of those to
bring it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the amount that you would have to
bring in, it'd be detrimental to that
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because something's organic,
doesn't necessarily mean safe or doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily mean that it's gonna have a
positive benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cons for kelp for me and the people
that I work with and consult with,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cons outweigh the pros, is what I'm
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's more native impact associated
with using kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the thing that most people will say,
oh, I wanna use kelp for the
[SPEAKER_01]: phytohormones, the things like the oxen,
which is indole acetic acid or the citric
acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can find most of those trace
mineral elements in most of the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: meals, like I was talking about before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blood meal, bone meal, feather meal,
they all contain trace mineral elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your compost contain trace mineral
elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have, and if you're
looking strictly for a phytohormone input,
[SPEAKER_01]: the benefit from plant hormones,
I use kiaha.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use cold pressed kiaha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the dehydrated, but the cold pressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because the kiaha doesn't have
any of the negative associations with the
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals, the sodium, the chloride,
but it does contain all the bioactive
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds, the organic saponins.
[SPEAKER_01]: It contains all of the cytokinins,
jubrulins and indole acetic acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as a bunch of other things like
amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take different approaches and I
know which approaches work best for the
[SPEAKER_01]: practical application of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the science, most of the science will
say, oh, kelp works wonders, kelp works
[SPEAKER_01]: wonders, but most of these things are done
on just regular food crops and none of
[SPEAKER_01]: those food crops are being tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the end results?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the metals levels content?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the actual mineral nutritional
value of these?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can get bio stimulating effects from
a lot of different things, including
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I take just a different approach
when it comes to kelp and that's my
[SPEAKER_01]: reasoning behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you about the
cytokinins, the hormones, oxens,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you hear about people using kelp
specifically for those reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you got into that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our cold pressed kiaha is actually sourced
from regenerative farms down in Chile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is now, if you were to look at the
comparison of like the other products that
[SPEAKER_01]: are the dehydrated, dehydrated products
that they have a higher content of
[SPEAKER_01]: saponins because there's everything else
has been extracted out with our product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 8.6% saponins, which is very high,
but it's also all of the other bioactive
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds and the diversity of those
saponins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might only get maybe like 70 or
something like that with a dehydrated
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with a cold press product,
you'll get something like 114.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up next, let's talk about potassium
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So potassium is a interesting element in
the fact that the plants need it in
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a macronutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's responsible for the opening and
closing of the guard cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is responsible for sodium ion pumps to
make diffusion work across cellular
[SPEAKER_01]: membranes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with water transport because
those guard cells on the stomata,
[SPEAKER_01]: they open it up and allow for
transportation of nutrients and water
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium is responsible for that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a bunch of different things that
it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, potassium comes from mineral
appetites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually comes from minerals,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is not typically in abundance in,
you know, conventional agriculture soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the land that we see isn't really
super fertile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you would have to remediate it before
you can grow crops or you have to use for
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation techniques and crop covers and
add carbon, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to potassium sulfate,
it is a mineral sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a naturally occurring mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: That allows us to get that much needed
element really quickly when we need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there are a couple of different
things that I use for potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, potassium comes in in a couple of
different ways, typically in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So compost, it comes in compost and not in
huge quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're usually maybe two, three percent
potassium when we're talking about compost
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium, I see uses is probably the
number two element, especially in heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: fruiting and medicinal plants,
heavy fruiting for vegetable varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we need a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs a lot of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these plants do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can get it from potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one is potassium silica is what I
like, is another thing that I use,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the trade name Agsil-16.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's essentially potash and sand heated up
really hot together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mixed together and it's a water
soluble form of both potassium and silica
[SPEAKER_01]: and monosilic acid in that form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is available form and it's the least
expensive form of silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using a silica amendment,
this is by far the most cost effective way
[SPEAKER_01]: to get silica in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got 32 percent potassium by volume,
so you can use small amounts to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is water soluble, so you can mix it
into a fertigation tank and water it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also foiler apply Agsil-16
potassium silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works really, really well because
it changes the pH of the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using it as a foiler
application, it'll change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll temporarily change the phylosphere
of the plant, which a lot of pathogens
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be used as a fungicide in that
respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, also adding the potassium and the
silica, which is available to the plant as
[SPEAKER_01]: a spray as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The potassium sulfate, depending on how
much it's processed, and what I mean by
[SPEAKER_01]: processing is they'll micronize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll grind it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get it in chunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the benefit of having chunks is that
you can get it as a top dress and just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of leave it in there as your top
dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you water in, it'll slowly release
over time when you have higher granulars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if it's a granular form of potassium
sulfate and you're using that in like a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil mix, the benefit is that it'll be a
slow release, but it'll also add pore
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that'll help with water penetration
throughout that soil system if it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: granular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also comes in fully water soluble form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way you can add it to a reservoir
or you can water it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, because it is a mineral
sulfate, it's gonna be metabolically
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can use this to quickly adjust
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I were to get a soil test back and I
saw that somebody's potassium was low,
[SPEAKER_01]: my go-to is usually going to be potassium
sulfate or Axyl-16.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other things that contain
potassium like green sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people try to use green sand as
a potassium amendment, but the problem is
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The release of potassium for green sand is
so slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about several months to
years for it to become available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while it does add some component of
aeration and a very, very small component
[SPEAKER_01]: of potassium, it's one of those things
that is almost just like an extra that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could have in there if you wanted to,
and it's not gonna hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna really affect anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not something that I could
recommend as an agronomist and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, this is what you should be using to
try to get your system back into
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it just doesn't add the amount
that's gonna be needed to bring it up in
[SPEAKER_01]: an adequate amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another mineral amendment that we can talk
about is solpomag, also known as K-mag,
[SPEAKER_01]: also known as langbenite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it usually has around 22% potassium,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're not typically looking at
is on the back of it, it also contains
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem with langbenite is that
the magnesium and that sulfur are way more
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble when they're in the system either
as a top dress or if it's been,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you've tried to mix it with water,
let it dissolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: The magnesium in there, if you're trying
to address just potassium, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: remember potassium and magnesium are
antagonistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're deficient in potassium,
you go add solpomag or langbenite
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking, hey, this has got 22% potassium,
it's all gravy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just neglected the fact that you added
in 9% magnesium that is pretty much 100%
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have this partially soluble 22%
that's gonna be slow released over the
[SPEAKER_01]: next couple of months versus this
magnesium that you just added in,
[SPEAKER_01]: jacking up your magnesium levels,
creating more antagonisms between the
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium and the potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could actually be thinking you're
putting in a potassium amendment when what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing is actually making it less
available for the potassium that's already
[SPEAKER_01]: in there because you just jacked up the
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you didn't need magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of growers that reach out to
me that they're tinkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to add things in as they see fit
and they're throwing off the balance,
[SPEAKER_00]: the overall balance, and they're really
getting into hot water there because
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it's hard to get back in balance
in that case, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any tips for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm typically looking at,
there are some major things and the three
[SPEAKER_01]: major things are gonna be sodium,
bicarbonate and chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bicarbonate will antagonize all of your
cations, calcium, magnesium, iron,
[SPEAKER_01]: just everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it makes it so that way the plant
has to work way harder to get what it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you have sufficiency and
everything is balanced in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you've got really high bicarbonate
levels, it's going to drive down the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability for the plant to uptake those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing can be said with sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: When sodium levels get higher and higher
and higher, it causes osmotic stress on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you have events where you're
drying out your soil, well then your ECE
[SPEAKER_01]: spikes and you have all of this oxidation
occurring of all your mineral elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not conducive to plant health,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It causes a lot of osmotic stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It causes issues with all the other
nutrient interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chloride is an anion and high chloride
will also negatively affect those types of
[SPEAKER_01]: elements that are anions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphate, nitrate, molybdenum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, one of the things that you have to
look at is sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur can cause osmotic stress as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if your sulfur levels are too high
and they can, especially if you're using a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of mineral sulfates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll change up the mineral sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I won't use gypsum or potassium
sulfate at all and I'll use calcium silica
[SPEAKER_01]: and Axyl-16 because if my sulfur level is
already high and I go ahead and add those
[SPEAKER_01]: in, I have to be mindful that I'm also
adding a certain amount of sulfur into
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur is an anion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used to help with charge balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also used for protein production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used for oil production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used for a lot of different things in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a photosynthetic element as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you dry out, that sulfur causes
ECE spikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The electronic conductivity of the soil,
it spikes up and cause issues with osmotic
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, it can have some negative
impacts on other anions like phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned sodium and bicarbonate and
that's the reason why I can't use my tap
[SPEAKER_00]: water here where I am is because we're
looking at about 80 ppm of sodium and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: real high in bicarbonates as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't even use my tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to filter it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's another area where I think a
lot of people kind of neglect looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: is they don't actually get a water test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't even know what they're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're adding in these
amendments along with their water and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: jacking everything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happens too is it's not
necessarily going to be an issue the first
[SPEAKER_01]: round, the second round, the third round.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happens is a lot of times these
problems are compounded over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you bring sodium a little bit,
a little bit, a little bit, a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: until it adds up to a point where
someone's like, dude, I don't know what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't diagnose the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done anything different.
[SPEAKER_01]: My regimen's the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing I do when I go to a
consult is say, hey, you guys need to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure you're testing your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if you're using RO,
city water, well water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all has to be tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll test.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're on a well, we'll test your well
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll test your RO water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see if we even need RO.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see if we just need
specific filters because we're not trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to waste money either.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not trying to waste water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to be as environmentally
positively.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to create more issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want compound problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same thing with kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to fail for arsenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's come to a point where that
arsenic finally built up into the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: because you kept bringing it in with
certain products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mediate that by just knowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is home growers,
they don't test.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And commercial facilities a lot of times
don't test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very seldom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That people are doing what I'm doing in
the industry that I work in when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty standard practice across all the
rest of the agriculture industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you're growing corn or soy or
ornamental flowers or tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's agronomy and data involved where
we want to know how much of what we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to use so we don't over apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we keep nutritional sufficiency in
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy metals is another area where we
could do an entire episode on if we wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been learning so much about heavy
metals recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're complex, too, the way that they
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll save that for another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have time for a few more of these
amendments to go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you got the list in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there ones you want to kind of pick out
that you'd like to talk about here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can kind of put all of the
micronutrient sulfates all together in
[SPEAKER_01]: one, which would be iron sulfate,
copper sulfate, zinc sulfate, manganese
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfate, and then sodium borate.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are these are all natural natural
salts and they're used in extremely,
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely small quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I mean extremely small,
I'm usually talking about one third to a
[SPEAKER_01]: half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the most that you would do
is maybe like three teaspoons per yard of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about for every six
hundred and fifty pounds of soil you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about, you know,
maybe half a teaspoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for something like sodium
borate, to bring that to sufficiency for
[SPEAKER_01]: several runs, you could put in point,
you know, point three, three of a teaspoon
[SPEAKER_01]: or one third of a teaspoon into one yard
of soil and know that you're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: enough boron and that you're not even have
to address boron for that for the
[SPEAKER_01]: remainder of of your your your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of the same thing with with
zinc and copper and manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amounts that you use are so low that
it's actually hard to use them as a top
[SPEAKER_01]: dress.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically what we're doing with these
micronutrient sulfates is we're
[SPEAKER_01]: distributing them evenly over the soil
surface using either a spray application
[SPEAKER_01]: or by watering it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say I have a yard of soil and I
know, hey, I'm going to be using a five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use five gallons for this
yard of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to mix my nutrients sulfates
into this yard of soil with my humic
[SPEAKER_01]: fulvic acid and I'm going to water this
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have an even distribution of all of
these micronutrient sulfates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we're talking about like if you
started off with zero micronutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: copper, iron, you're going to have a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put in about a cup and a half to
two cups per yard of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we're talking about, let's say
zinc, you'll you could do two and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: teaspoons for an entire yard of soil that
has nothing been added to it as far as a
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you are going to be sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will give you enough sufficiency
to go for several runs as long as the
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass that you're pulling off,
like your leaf material and stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: getting recycled back into your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're taking all of your biomass
out of your soil system and not letting
[SPEAKER_01]: that cycle back naturally, you're going to
have to add more sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: With copper, you can do the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three and a half teaspoons for an entire
yard of soil will bring you up to
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritional sufficiency for a while for
several cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manganese sulfate, you can do two and a
half teaspoons and bring that up to
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sodium borate is half of a teaspoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Borax, just regular borax would be twice
that amount or one teaspoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you don't have to do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could even, if you were to take
those and start off with nothing and
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch those out over a six month period
and be like, I'm going to add one
[SPEAKER_01]: milliliter of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like those ratios right there are
solid and will get you to nutritional
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little goes a long way with those
micronutrient sulfates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you're talking about the
macronutrients or secondary nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfates like potassium, calcium,
and magnesium, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because calcium sulfate, magnesium
sulfate, potassium sulfate, you usually
[SPEAKER_01]: use a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are in the cups per yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I might do half of a cup of magnesium
sulfate if I was deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the target, the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm always just looking at the data
and say, hey, this is how much is missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how much needs to be added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have time to squeeze in
azomite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So azomite is one of the amendments that I
don't currently use anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have found that it doesn't contain
enough of anything to realistically be of
[SPEAKER_01]: any use.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I found about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says it has A to Z micronutrients and
minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we're looking at sufficiency,
perspective, the amount of azomite that
[SPEAKER_01]: you would have to bring into a system to
actually have the right amount of calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: or manganese or zinc or other stuff is
just not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are things that have been
associated with azomite such as heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metals and aluminum that could have
detrimental impact on the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of those things where,
for me, the cons outweigh the pros.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't see a big benefit if I wanted
to add in a type of rock mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at it from what perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I bringing in this rock mineral?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I need to increase my ECE?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I need to bring in calcium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I need to bring in phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_01]: All my micronutrients are covered because
I have micronutrient sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have also meals, organic meals that
contain those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more of just a luxury thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to add it in, you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend relying on it for
anything in specific because it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do one specific thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of a luxury item to have
that you could use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always go with the less is more
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not something that I don't have to
spend extra money on it, if it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary, I'm not going to, especially
not at scale because all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: additional costs, they all add up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a small business and as a farmer,
all of those additional costs are
[SPEAKER_01]: something that we could have put back into
our pocket at the end of the day and used
[SPEAKER_01]: to take the family on vacation,
get some much needed R&R or to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: tractor repaired or get the tools that we
need to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always looking at this from a
really cost analytical perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually the reason why I got
into organics because I did hydroponics
[SPEAKER_01]: for 11 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I switched to soil and I was
using chemical synthetic fritigation
[SPEAKER_01]: salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until I needed to find a
better business model of how I could
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce my costs that I really started to
look at all of the inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a cultivator, there are so many
products on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the classes that we're going to
be doing, and we'll have that live on our
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon, is going to be, I'm going to have
the people that come into the class bring
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff in from their home that they're
using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to talk about what is in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a bottled nutrient,
let's say advanced nutrients or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, that's 96% water and it has a
little bit of diammonium phosphate,
[SPEAKER_01]: some magnesium sulfate and potassium
sulfate in it, well, you can buy all those
[SPEAKER_01]: things in bulk and save yourself on
shipping a bunch of water and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: ripped off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're being overcharged and then you're
being taxed for shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really important for any
person who's cultivating at home to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what the product is that
they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're using X product that has
this, this and this and this in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: know individually what these components
are used for and what benefits they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then figure out, hey, can I figure out
how to apply this single element itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if something has bone meal and crab
meal and Epsom salt and gypsum and humic
[SPEAKER_01]: and fulvic acids and all this other stuff,
and they're jacked up the price way high
[SPEAKER_01]: because they blended it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be able to distinguish what is
in the products that you're using and
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out if you could do it more cost
effective or if you're being charged extra
[SPEAKER_01]: money just because there's a fancy logo on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people fall into the trap of
buying more than what they need and
[SPEAKER_00]: really, yeah, they're spending more money
than they need to and they could be
[SPEAKER_00]: spending their money elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also one of the reasons why I do
package up these amendments individually
[SPEAKER_01]: for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a surplus on that because it
costs labor and packaging and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also supply bulk and 50 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, if you're a farm or if you
need to get these things in larger
[SPEAKER_01]: quantities, you're not spending the money,
the extra money to have it packaged and
[SPEAKER_01]: the labor associated with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can buy it all at the wholesale
price, which is way more cost affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you go and buy a 50 pound bag
of Epsom salt for 25 bucks, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: bam, that's money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy a 50 pound bag of gypsum for
like 17, 18 bucks in most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a provider, someone that's
local to you that has all those things,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just much more cost effective and
it's much more sensible from a business
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's wrap things up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us, how can the listeners find you
and what do you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can find me on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two profiles and a backup account
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rust.brandon, R-U-S-T dot
B-R-A-N-D-O-N.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am ShadowBand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to type that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also Bokashi Earthworks,
which is B-O-K-A-S-H-I Earthworks,
[SPEAKER_01]: all one word.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the website, which is www
.shadowbrandon.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: BokashiEarthworks.com, where we provide
things like seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have biostimulants, amino acids,
all the amendments that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also sell bulk soils, amendments,
all that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's not listed on the website,
you can just inquire through email about
[SPEAKER_01]: pricing and all that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the censorship on social media,
we're seeing that right now in the news,
[SPEAKER_01]: congressional hearings, all that other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been difficult to really reach a lot
of the people that are following.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're off platforming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're building up our own platforms by
doing podcasts with other great content
[SPEAKER_01]: creators like yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our own Patreon, where we'll
actually organize all of that content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have exclusive content.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have live educational presentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, we're doing something
similar to what we're doing today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be more in depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have all the amendments on
hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can look at them, feel them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be in class,
in person, in Oklahoma City.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those will be livestreamed on the Patreon
and then slowly released over the course
[SPEAKER_01]: of the next several months on YouTube and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's a lot of moving parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things that we got going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're working hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working hard to make it all happen,
come together.
