[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, welcome back to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka MrGrowIt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're tuned in to my Garden Talk
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I have a Q&A video for you,
but I want to make a quick announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stash Blend is now released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stash Blend is a plant additive that was
developed by the From the Stash team,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it has a whole bunch of good stuff in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find out more at stashblend.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good day, good a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: My autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla cookies are starting to show white
pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you recommend to change nutrition?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, autoflowers probably on the same
light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably plan to be on the same light
cycle for the entire grow, whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: 18-6, 20-0, 24-0, whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really sure when to start
feeding those flower nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I typically do it around day 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make that transition day 30-40 if I'm
a little bit late with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's usually when I'm starting
to see pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually when I'm transitioning
over to the flower nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it can vary from grower to
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll probably hear a different answer
from different people, depending on who
[SPEAKER_00]: you ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's some people that go four,
five, six weeks in using their veg newts,
[SPEAKER_00]: then flip to the flowering newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're just seeing that
transition of flower happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, around day 30-40 is when I'm
switching over to the flower nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any companies doing sales for
Prime Day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually sponsoring this Q&A
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Prime sale all month, apparently up to
25% off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you've seen me use their lights in
the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's click on this and see what they got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got a bunch of featured deals
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: FC series.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like they have the FCE series.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got some grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a whole bunch of good things you can
get in more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like they have their TS series as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: UV and IR bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, check out their Prime Day sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll actually have a link to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the YouTube description section below,
and you can use my discount code MRGROWIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get you an additional percentage off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is good ways of adding humidity
temporarily to a grow tent until your
[SPEAKER_00]: humidifier arrives?
[SPEAKER_00]: So waiting on that humidifier,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I was in the same exact situation as
you quite some time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny that the creative things
that you can think of to do search online,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find a whole bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things that I have done is the wet
towel method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking a bunch of towels, wetting them
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hanging them in the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as far as how much it helps,
it's obviously going to depend on how much
[SPEAKER_00]: you're exhausting out of the grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just exhausting 24 seven,
you could easily just rip that humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the common method people are
using with wet towels, putting like
[SPEAKER_00]: containers that are filled with water into
your grow tent, that kind of helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as how effective it'll be,
really is dependent on kind of how much
[SPEAKER_00]: you're exhausting out of there,
how wet the towels are, what your current
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity is.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as how much you actually increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lots of variables on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are a couple of things I can
think of off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I miss?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some of you guys out there
that are doing just that, trying to add in
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidity, don't have a humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know down in the comments section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked this once before, but do you
notice any smell from the Canada Troll?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, during what stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to be doing a full Q&A
video on the Canada Troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really do a Q&A live stream like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I'm just answering Canada Troll
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure when I have that scheduled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely follow me on Twitch,
twitch.tv slash MrGrowIt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then make sure notifications are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once notifications are on,
you can come in and ask questions about
[SPEAKER_00]: the Canada Troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer this one here for you right
now, of course, almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely did notice the smell,
particularly when drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just put two plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I put one plant in there,
filled everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was six days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now filled everything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it immediately starts to smell for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have the drip pan on the back,
things are dripping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably what's happened is that's
just volatizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it's just volatizing coming into
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely notice the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: My girlfriend notices the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it's most strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strongest is during the dry period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when things are kind of stable,
you don't really smell it as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, I had the Canada Troll
kind of right next to my door and outside
[SPEAKER_00]: my door, there's a hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next door over is my girlfriend's
office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said she smells it when she walks
by.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just when she walks by, she'll smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really only during the dry
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now me, I really, I smell it because I'm
sniffing for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whenever I come into my office
here and I have it on another part of my
[SPEAKER_00]: office right next to right behind me,
actually, you can see it and I'm drying
[SPEAKER_00]: and I do smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as how strong, I wouldn't say
it's like crazy strong to where like your
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors are going to be notified,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I mentioned, if you've got it
next to a door into a hallway and you got
[SPEAKER_00]: people walking by, they'll probably sniff
it out if they know what the smell is,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they'll just be like, and then just
keep moving past the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as just storage though,
when I just have stuff in storage,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not actually drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, I can't really tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that time, there's really nothing
dripping in the back drip pan after the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying period anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, I have two plants drying in
there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let one dry for a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was able to kind of consolidate it
down into, and then make room for another
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that had smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got two plants in there right now and
things are going pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things have always been pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hands off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've come to really despise trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any tips or know of any
devices to help expedite the process?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I'm looking to get my hands on
is a bowl trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know, I know there's a lot of
controversy behind the bowl trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like everybody that has a bowl
trimmer that I know really enjoys it once
[SPEAKER_00]: they understand how to start using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pigeon's 420, for example, I'll give him a
shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is somebody who was skeptical about the
bowl trimmer, ended up getting his hands
[SPEAKER_00]: on one and just absolutely loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave some good tips in regards to
using it as well, like more larpier type,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when you're putting it into that bowl
trimmer, he says it doesn't work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needs to be kind of more dense and
you kind of get the hang of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it takes a little bit to kind of
get used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to get my hands on one,
to be honest with you, just to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are people on the other end that
are just like ripping off your trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's destroying your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, buy one at your own risk,
I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do buy one, you can use code
MrGrowat15, specifically the AC Infinity
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have a, I want to say 16 inch
and a 19 inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be wrong about that, but yeah,
you get a little discount with my discount
[SPEAKER_00]: code.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get my hands on one now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that, you know,
from what Pigeon was saying, really speeds
[SPEAKER_00]: up the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you recommend a cultivar that has a
turf profile that can be contained in with
[SPEAKER_00]: a carbon filter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Much of the wide leaf cultivars have a
very strong odor that is not scrubbed
[SPEAKER_00]: fully by filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which carbon filter are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I'd want to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to ask what size grow space
you're in and what size carbon filter you
[SPEAKER_00]: have in that grow space, because that
could certainly impact it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all carbon filters are created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hard to, you know, verify which
ones are going to work better than others,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just the brand carbon filter
you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, I don't know if you're using the
cheaper brand or kind of more a brand
[SPEAKER_00]: known for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be the carbon filter, assuming it's
not the carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it must be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if it's escaping any sort of
smell, something's wrong there with the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filter, because I've grown a large
variety of cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as the carbon filter is hooked
up properly, then it's always been working
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tricky question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know how else to answer
that, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much that's going to vary
whether or not it smells during the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering period, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher the temp, more terrapines are
going to volatize, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're lowering the temp,
you're not going to have as many terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: volatizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're worried about smell,
that might be something you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe run like a temp, you know,
75, 70 degrees throughout the grow instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of kind of going up into the low eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in theory, you should have less
terpenes volatizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have less smell, but tough
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have been able to answer for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far would you say you are towards
completing your book?
[SPEAKER_00]: 65%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've got, I would say a majority of
the sections written, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: chapters written, and I'm actually kind of
going back and scrubbing some of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: chapters that I written every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just writing, trying to get this book
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things looking pretty good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm kind of timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate saying timelines because,
you know, if I miss, then all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: you got those people reaching out to you
and they're like, hey, you missed your
[SPEAKER_00]: timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: But within the next two months,
I want it completely written.
[SPEAKER_00]: September 1st, I want to be on to the next
stages, which is book design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously like the editing have send it
over to an editor to review proofread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes to the actual design.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll actually be collecting photos,
photography from you guys to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody wants to get their photography
featured in my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep an eye out for that one on social.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely make just a ton of
announcements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that last time and the submissions,
it was so fun seeing all the submissions
[SPEAKER_00]: of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm excited to see some new
photography that you guys submit in,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, about 65% I'd say so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope to have it a hundred percent
written and onto the whole designing
[SPEAKER_00]: process and so on and so forth come
September, you know, early September is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'll say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any set scale for weekly PPM
or EC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do, Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually it's in my book, which I'll bust
out right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys familiar with this one or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a section here for PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have EC in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely going to be included in
the next revision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might add like a scale for EC,
but we flip to the PPM section,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is on page 68 of the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: General recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people are going a little bit
higher than what's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are going a lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a sprout, weeks, the seedling
stage, week one vegetation, some people
[SPEAKER_00]: call it 100 to 250 PPM and a 500,
we're talking 500 scale PPM meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetation stage, weeks two to three,
300 to 400 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetation week, weeks four and beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically for like 400 to 50 to 700
PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're growing in a larger
container, larger plant, certainly you can
[SPEAKER_00]: go higher than this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just general recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that you're growing like
small to medium sized plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing larger plants,
you can definitely get away with going
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower stage is one to four, 750 to 950
PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower stage is five and beyond 1000 to
1600 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in here, actually one thing that
a lot of people used to do, they don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: it much anymore, is like reduce the PPM as
much as possible as you're getting close
[SPEAKER_00]: to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says here two weeks prior to
harvest, less than 100 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just if you are a flusher,
if you like to flush, if you want to go by
[SPEAKER_00]: that method, some people will flush their
plant towards the end of the grow to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce the PPM as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They swear it brings better terpenes and
cannabinoids and better taste and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, but do that at your own risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like these days it's kind of an
outdated technique that not a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something I definitely want to
clarify in the next revision on my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has been your favorite cultivar to
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you come across any finicky ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel like I've answered this
question in a past episode, so I won't get
[SPEAKER_00]: too deep on it, but Queen Anne's Revenge
by TGA Genetics, formerly TGA Genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: went to Subcool Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Miss Jill took over Queen Anne's
Revenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely been one of the favorite
plants I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had magnesium deficiency to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was real slight, easy to fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I fixed the magnesium deficiency,
which I believe was late veg, early
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, the plant was healthy throughout
the rest of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it was a real easy feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dense buds, top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was basically towards the end when
it's ready for harvest, it changed colors,
[SPEAKER_00]: covered in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as effects, real narcotic effect,
chill effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say entirely Coach Lock side of
things, but definitely narcotic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of when it comes to the actual
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's been my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as finicky, man, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, you ask people who have
grown the true sour diesel and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a challenge to grow that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine was very finicky, very sensitive
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not come out good at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even get a good harvest from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, every time I talk about
sour diesel and the difficulty that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: had, you definitely get a handful of
people that are like, yep, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how she is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy, but it can be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a fun challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to Mr. Canuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Heard someone was trying to steal his
channel from him by registering a business
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Mr. Canuck title.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what happened to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hasn't been posting as much lately
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got some fantastic videos for those
of you guys that don't know who Mr. Canuck
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just search for him on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just amazing cinematography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's coming up close to a million
subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might be the first one to actually
reach a million subscribers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community that has that plant that we all
know and love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know what happened to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually I found that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trademark search.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a trademark search for Mr.
Canucks grow, you'll see that it's not him
[SPEAKER_00]: that owns it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so somebody did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's been anything
beyond that as far as people like
[SPEAKER_00]: threatening him or trying to steal his
channel from him because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, maybe he'll come back and start
making some more videos soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy his videos, really enjoy
his content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known him for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've been in contact since I
think 2016, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, he has just grown more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gotten better and better when it
comes to his filming, editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just when you think somebody can't get
better, at that you see him and he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I miss him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope he comes back soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever ran 18 six last 10 days of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that in particular, but I have tried
out the 24 zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nonstop light for the last 48 hours of
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't readily have access to testing
here, so I'm not able to kind of test the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid profile, terpene profile,
so on and so forth of the two differences
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of report back what the change
was that was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so just kind of looking to see
if there was a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really see much, if anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't done 18 six for the last 10
days like you mentioned there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what your results were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is nicotine poisoning a real thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean like tobacco mosaic virus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's certainly a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicotine poisoning on the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about like on humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that might be what you're
referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just Google that and you can find
out more.
[SPEAKER_00]: More about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any test that I shouldn't be
worried about or all pests bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say there's pests that are easier
to manage than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ones that come to my mind right
off the bat is fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I've battled on and off,
but I feel like I am able to easily get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of and kill off the population as
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you just got to have to have the
practice and know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several of the pests are like really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some pests where like you
just can't recover from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could sit here for the next
hour and go through pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend podcast episode garden
talk with Matthew Gates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what episode it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually search on YouTube garden
talk, Matthew Gates and great episode
[SPEAKER_00]: where we talk about, is it the top 10
pests and how to battle them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really good episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy has so much knowledge in regards
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you come across fungus gnats,
I wouldn't be too worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure what stage, what level you are,
how long you've been growing for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people see fungus gnats and
they just start panicking, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they think everything's over and they
got to wipe everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you stay on top of it,
you should be able to get rid of them
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I like to do it, there's so
many different ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, yellow stickies to
identify.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to kill off the
populations, but you can at least identify
[SPEAKER_00]: and trap and kill some of the ones that
are active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yellow stickies in every single pod is
what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like using the mammoth cantral,
which is their their IPM product that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one, I love using that thing to
knock up, knock down populations and also
[SPEAKER_00]: as a preventative as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been one of the strongest things
I've used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Dr. Zymes is another fantastic
product that has helped out tremendously
[SPEAKER_00]: for both preventing and for knocking back
some populations on some of those pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So off top of my head, those are the two
main products that I can kind of recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: and vouch for that I've used and work
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, kind of going back to your
question, fungus gnats, if you do come
[SPEAKER_00]: across those, I wouldn't be overly worried
about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, mosquito bits is another main one
that people use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of helps with the larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically beneficial bacteria that
helps knock back the larva population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look into that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then diatomaceous earth is something
that is used by so many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just having that in at the top layer
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much like glass shards for
those pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some controversy behind
diatomaceous earth, and I'm not really too
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to speak about it, but there is
somebody who is concerned about their
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there isn't really studies on
diatomaceous earth to knock down fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnat population in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't get too deep into that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll be able to invite Matthew Gates
on to speak about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been using it anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some, so why not use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't do harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really silica is what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you switched from earth dust to kiss
organics for reamending soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stopped using earth dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, green sunshine company is
no longer up and running.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, unfortunately that business
closed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad to see them go, you know,
very small company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew Dan personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did several videos together.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had the electric sky, uh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 180 and yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 very, very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used them for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the earth dust amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately they're no longer earth
dust is no longer being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually reached out to him and asked
him about the manufacturing earth dust and
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to bring it back and, uh,
doesn't look like it's feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like it's worth it to
bring it back is what kind of what I
[SPEAKER_00]: should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I've been using kiss organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used build a soil craft blend for
several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I just, uh, just coming up on
completing a grow using kiss organics
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that don't know, it's a blend of
organic amendments and, uh, just top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I did the initial mending of the
soil to begin and top dressing every 30
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants would look fantastic throughout the
entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yeah, just harvested two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about a little bit earlier on the
stream here and I've got them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada troll right now drying.
