[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Barely Growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing so well, Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to get into outdoor
gardening tips and tricks for success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a few people request more outdoor
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mostly an indoor gardener,
so I mostly focus on that, but I do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: small outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I grow vegetables, but before we get
too deep into outdoor gardening,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Cassie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be 29 this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live out in Oklahoma, and I own my
little farmhouse in three acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one child.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing or gardening for about
two and a half years, so I'm still fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: new, but I've really learned a lot in this
short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants have really, really helped me
a lot overcome a lot of anxiety and
[SPEAKER_02]: depression, and I went through postpartum
depression and just a lot of general life
[SPEAKER_02]: haste.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am super in love with it, and I'm really
excited to share it with everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you from ... I think I found you on
Instagram first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a pretty big Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a lot of skits, funny skits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really definitely entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question I have is, when you are
outdoor growing, how do you determine a
[SPEAKER_00]: good spot to plant your plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think first things first.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first started, I really need to
know what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Oklahoma, we have a lot of red clay or
red dirt and clay mixture, and not a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of abundance in the nutrient department.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that being said, I think the first
thing you need to do is get your hand in
[SPEAKER_02]: the dirt in this soil where you think
you're going to be growing and feel it
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look for everything that you need to be
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Richness, the color, how wet is it
already?
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's dry, if it's rock solid,
you've got to assess that situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you also need to look at how much
sunlight you're going to get in that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular area and shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our plants are sun prominent plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need the most sun that they can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just really feel around and I check out
what my daylight's like in the middle of
[SPEAKER_02]: summer and every stage, spring,
summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really it, really soil and sunlight
is going to be your two best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you grow medicinal plants just like
me, but you also grow some other type of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically like to grow
outdoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working on food forests,
so we have a lot of fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ordered those in as cuttings and we
planted them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going on year three for
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Carolina peach tree just went crazy
last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a beautiful sight.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not into fruiting yet, but I'm
hoping this season we'll bring fruit,
[SPEAKER_02]: bountiful fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really enjoy watching the trees grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They operate kind of like our medicinal
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still have to prune them and you can
train them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want your trees to be super
tall to climb a ladder, you can hang
[SPEAKER_02]: weights on their branches and train them
down so it's easier for picking and you
[SPEAKER_02]: take off the dead leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like the trees, but I also really
like comfrey and that chef's kiss of a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can chop and drop it and let it
replenish the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a ton of NPK and even trace
nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can take that and you can put it in
a bunch of water and you can make comfrey
[SPEAKER_02]: tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the coolest part.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow your own fertilizer to grow
your own food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is so rad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think comfrey is probably my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now do you grow just in the ground or do
you grow in containers or do you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: raised bed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, I think it was last year,
it might have been the year before,
[SPEAKER_02]: we killed off, oh I'm so bad with
measurements, a ton of our front yard
[SPEAKER_02]: grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Johnson grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: We killed it off with cardboard and we
basically tried the lasagna method.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you probably know what that is,
but if anybody doesn't it's where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: stacking carbon and greens on top of each
other and you're not tilling into the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just basically creating this really
beautiful, I have compost, composted area
[SPEAKER_02]: to where you can plant directly in instead
of just digging into the actual ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I liked to plant last season.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also did have, I think it was like a 10
gallon air bottom bag outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a huge mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing is extremely porous so my
plants dried out almost instantly and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really not my cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have all this space outside so I'm going
to utilize that first.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were to go back into pots,
it would be purely for aesthetics and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think I'd use like an old barrel container
instead of super mesh breathable
[SPEAKER_02]: container.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, into the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, preparing the soil for planting,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what seasons you are
typically growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume it gets cold and you don't really
grow much in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you plant for the season,
how do you prepare that soil for planting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lasagna method is a really good method
to use for preparing your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like here, for instance, I have
livestock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have two horses and I have two cows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have pigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have chicks now, but they used to roam
around and just poop everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sounds gross, but it's really
good for the lawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So composting, composting is huge,
whether it be your food scraps or
[SPEAKER_02]: livestock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't have livestock,
I'm sure there are some around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go ask your neighbors if they want to
give you free poop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be super worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So composting is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last year we did the lasagna method
and we still have that and you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to redo that every year, which I think is
brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just stays and you can build on top of
that as you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we are moving things to the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this year we have our compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been cooking for two seasons now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep adding to it and turning it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year we've already got it ready
We actually have six garden rows out back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a rototill the top layer and we
brought our compost over and put it on top
[SPEAKER_02]: so that all of the nutrients can kind of
set.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's rained a handful of times already
since doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a really beneficial way
to prepare your soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing that people often do is
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people do it before they do
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do cover crops along with
their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do cover crops at all or no?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do many cover crops last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually didn't learn about cover crops
until last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was kind of just free-winging it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get into that I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our biggest cover crop here is
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just kind of let a ton of clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: We let a ton of white clover seed just all
over the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have clover popping up
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And wouldn't you know it, it's in places
that really, really need help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like super need help.
[SPEAKER_02]: But clover is the only cover crop that
they really utilized besides comfrey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And comfrey can also be used as a cover
crop because it has such a wide span of
[SPEAKER_02]: its leaves and it'll cover a ton of
distance if you plant it accordingly and
[SPEAKER_02]: where you need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that those two are really the
only things we utilized last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay and then another thing that kind of
goes hand-in-hand with cover crops so that
[SPEAKER_00]: people will do a mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any like wood chips,
a barley straw, or any type of mulch?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have ton of excess hay from our
livestock.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have grass hay and we have alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know a lot of people use like the
alfalfa meals which is super beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: for your soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so, so great for your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even just in whole form alfalfa that's
been used in the lasagna method and it is
[SPEAKER_02]: the most top layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But besides that we also contacted our
local electrical company and they do have
[SPEAKER_02]: to trim down a lot of trees to get to
their power lines and they always want a
[SPEAKER_02]: place to dump.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had them haul their giant truckload
over to our house and just dump it and
[SPEAKER_02]: then we took it and we spread it across
the lasagna garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah it's really super wonderful
for water retention.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's obviously there is
nutrients that you can get from these
[SPEAKER_02]: mulch layers but water retention is really
big.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get so hot and dry out here in Oklahoma
in the first part of like spring and
[SPEAKER_02]: summer and then it's just humid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has been really helpful for
watering because we're all human.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do all water every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like it could be beneficial
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you what fertilizer you
use and how you go about feedings but it
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds like from everything you've
explained so far that you have like a
[SPEAKER_00]: closed-loop operation going there where
you're just basically using your own
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs from your land so you're not buying
any like synthetic fertilizers or going
[SPEAKER_00]: out buying any organic fertilizers or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like oh my god what am I going to
do to feed all these plants outside?
[SPEAKER_02]: And well turns out when you have a perfect
environment you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of your nutrients, your macro and
your micro nutrients are already in these
[SPEAKER_02]: composted materials and manures and
already in some great soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we ran the clover last year and I know
that put a lot of inputs into our soils
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no I haven't had to use any
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: No synthetics outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big go grain advocate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do for the record use synthetics indoors
because I like to do it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no the only thing we did was try out
the comfrey tea last year and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants just went absolutely bonkers over
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to just add in if you are going
to try out a comfrey tea it can get a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to dilute that to like 15 to 1 is
a good ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't recommend using it on
seedlings so just be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not much food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it pretty easy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some people add in like sugars like
molasses or honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also microbial inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know you've got plenty of diverse
microbes in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you buy any micro products and use
them outdoors or no?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only used micro micro product micro
micro products indoors like dynomycho is a
[SPEAKER_02]: really popular one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I've seen it do some wondrous
things to the root zone like absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no not outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really big on sustainability and
like we're working on regenerative farming
[SPEAKER_02]: and those things kind of just like really
go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also part of like being sustainable is
not spending your money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really goes into it so no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I figured with all of the fruit trees
and the bigger trees because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: surrounded by a pretty decent little
forest out here in Oklahoma that there was
[SPEAKER_02]: plenty of mycorrhizae and all of that in
the ground already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't really found a need to add
into it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as like your molasses your
molasses I'm super not opposed to that as
[SPEAKER_02]: like teas like boosts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that may be something I would like to
try in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually like looked up like how do you
make molasses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I do that at home?
I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah people do commonly use them in you
know compost teas as a food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done any compost teas and use
them outdoors or no?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I haven't had the need to like last
year last season I had 11 foot Christmas
[SPEAKER_02]: trees and they flourished and I just I
didn't find a need to yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I may be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing outdoors is there's a lot of
differences between growing indoors and
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that you're more at risk
for outdoors is pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know they're all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole different battlefield.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically do to prevent pests?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to laugh at prevent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have I have learned to be more proactive
than reactive especially outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oklahoma has literally every pest you
could possibly think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last year I wasn't really great at
preventing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was more reactive and I would spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year I tried out crop defender by
Petra tools and it did OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really light application and it
seemed to do like the trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing with that is like you really
had to keep applying that to notice a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And something that I would really like to
advocate is like make sure that your soils
[SPEAKER_02]: are extremely healthy and your plants are
extremely healthy when you're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to give them the best chance
at survival to use their natural defenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But something that I will be utilizing
this year is like with companion planting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like there's tons of plants like
rosemary mint are really at the top of my
[SPEAKER_02]: list because they'll actually just deter
and repel plants or I'm sorry pests that
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't like the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too stinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lavender is also in that category.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you also have like companion
plants like marigolds and they'll actually
[SPEAKER_02]: like lure in the pests and keep them well
probably not all of them but keep them
[SPEAKER_02]: more interested in them versus the
medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that is just so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And A we get to avoid spraying anything on
our our crops but especially when we get
[SPEAKER_02]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always been extremely scary to me
like I don't want to spray anything on
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you run into two boy trips and
chemicals that you could potentially even
[SPEAKER_02]: be inhaling and like we don't want that we
don't want that outside at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think utilizing companion plants will
be my best route this year for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I'm going to have to step
my game up my outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a small I mean I'm in Las
Vegas and our backyards are so tiny and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just have a two foot by ten foot bed
raised bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so usually I grow some lettuce bok
choy kale peppers I've got some melons but
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any companion plants out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really think I'm going to step it up
this year have some rosemary and lavender
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe a few other things in there as
well to help on that avenue to help deter
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had aphids one year which was a freaking
nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so like heartbreak seeing those
things just all over your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah so it'd be good to not deal with
that in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fantastic that you're still
utilizing the space that you have even if
[SPEAKER_02]: it is small.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many people I've read it to
like I don't have this space oh but you do
[SPEAKER_02]: you can do anything like get yourself
window herbs or do what you're doing just
[SPEAKER_02]: a little raised bed box outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start small and it'll progress I promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can you can utilize all your
spaces you just have to want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I mean I'm even trying to cram in a
compost pile in my old door but like I
[SPEAKER_00]: have my whole yard is basically rock you
know it's just it's not moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the desert you know so it's like
there's no earthworms out here at least in
[SPEAKER_00]: my backyard is just so dry but I'm trying
to make space I'm gonna rake some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: rocks away and then and then start
composting out back because that's another
[SPEAKER_00]: important part of kind of outdoor growing
closed-loop operations all that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: which you had mentioned that you do
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extremely beneficial it's good for
your plants and it's good for the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment I mean if you can take all of
those food scraps instead of throwing them
[SPEAKER_02]: away and reutilize them you're doing your
part you're helping so much more than you
[SPEAKER_02]: think you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good that's exciting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I do want to get into composting a
little bit deeper but first I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: stick on the topic of pests for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had any major pest infestations
that you could talk about if so like how
[SPEAKER_00]: did you battle them?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a battle I lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just gonna be straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caterpillars were the demise of my 11 foot
Christmas tree last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't really battle them because they
were super pronounced during flower which
[SPEAKER_02]: is the stage that they really like and
what they'll do is they'll go into your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and of course eat the foliage but
they'll also poop in the buds and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: growers don't realize that's happened
until they're at harvest and the buds will
[SPEAKER_02]: literally just fall apart but that'll also
cause bud rot ultimately so I'm really
[SPEAKER_02]: health conscious so as soon as I started
seeing the bugs and even like one portion
[SPEAKER_02]: of bud rot I kind of was like this is
probably gonna be it for me I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke this but I wanted to see and with
the humidity and those caterpillars and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else that was out there I just
chopped them and I got rid of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't worth it to me to even
potentially smoke something hazardous so I
[SPEAKER_02]: just got rid of them but I am really super
open to whatever IPM regimens that people
[SPEAKER_02]: are doing in flower I haven't really found
a whole lot of information you know
[SPEAKER_02]: there's only there's so much more
information now than there even was just a
[SPEAKER_02]: few years ago but I'm really open to
suggestions for the outdoor grows because
[SPEAKER_02]: that really totally kicked me in the
behind last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I haven't come across caterpillars
but I've heard about them being a
[SPEAKER_00]: nightmare I was gonna ask you if you knew
of a way to get rid of them like if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a particular spray or if there's
any of those companion plants that you use
[SPEAKER_00]: that deter them or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I'm sure that companion plants will
come in super handy and I can almost
[SPEAKER_02]: guarantee that they'll be attracted to
things like the marigolds but I've also
[SPEAKER_02]: been told to use capsaicin a capsaicin
mixture with water and that will just
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely annihilate them them and many
other pests but I also want to add if you
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to do that do it downwind and
cover your eyes be very careful yeah I've
[SPEAKER_02]: heard that that the capsaicin will just
like basically dry them out suffocate them
[SPEAKER_02]: in their toast and yeah that's all fine
and dandy but then what happens when you
[SPEAKER_02]: get to flower I don't want to smoke spicy
you know I have so many questions about
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what other problems do you come across
when growing outdoors anything else come
[SPEAKER_00]: to mind for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah sure humidity humidity is a beast
within itself especially out here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oklahoma we literally sit in like 75 to 90
percent humidity when we get into summer
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's awful because when you get into
late summer you're showing signs of flower
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're kind of out of standpoint so
some of the things that I could recommend
[SPEAKER_02]: to you kind of like counter humidity is go
outside right as the Sun is rising and
[SPEAKER_02]: shake off any morning dew in your plant so
it doesn't have time to sit there and
[SPEAKER_02]: absorb especially again in flower and I
mean how do you battle outdoor moisture be
[SPEAKER_02]: really careful when you are using IPM like
make sure you're really trying to utilize
[SPEAKER_02]: that in vegetative state and also be
really careful when you're watering so
[SPEAKER_02]: like don't just go out there spraying your
whole plant down trying to cool it off
[SPEAKER_02]: cool it off because that will just
absolutely backfire make sure you're
[SPEAKER_02]: watering at the base and really trying to
avoid the foliage if you can you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it would be crazy to
actually train my plants this season and
[SPEAKER_02]: get them at maybe a little bit shorter
height for me I'm five foot two eleven
[SPEAKER_02]: foot plants that was challenged last year
but like training them down and even using
[SPEAKER_02]: like cattle panel and shade cloths because
it'll still allow the Sun to penetrate
[SPEAKER_02]: just take off like a few percentages of
the UV and even getting maybe like an
[SPEAKER_02]: industrial fan outside and just giving
them some extra airflow I think that could
[SPEAKER_02]: really super be beneficial like a
temporary greenhouse cloth house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious for those 11 foot plants I
mean that's massive what was your yield
[SPEAKER_00]: for that did you measure it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No because I had to chop them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh okay yeah so you didn't actually get
any of them to harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: No I did not want to risk it and it was
absolutely dead yeah I'm hanging my head
[SPEAKER_02]: it was it was really seriously sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have better luck this year on
that Avenue have you had any outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: harvests I was gonna ask you about like
you know there's a lot of controversy
[SPEAKER_00]: about a lot of debate about indoor versus
outdoor and the flavor profile I was
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering if you had an opinion on if you
feel like the outdoor sun grown results in
[SPEAKER_00]: a better terpene profile better flavor
compared to indoor or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so hard to say because we've grown
some really really fire indoor product
[SPEAKER_02]: like things that straight up smell like
fruit like like not flower fruit and it
[SPEAKER_02]: just absolutely blows my brain like
incredible and outside I know you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: beat the Sun but there's so many other
factors that go into it like environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: like what are you around what kind of
scents is this plant gonna pick up how's
[SPEAKER_02]: the pollution in your area like I think it
all plays a part and in sticking to these
[SPEAKER_02]: aromatic oils you know like I'm thinking
berries I think the Sun is a really
[SPEAKER_02]: powerful and beautiful tool but I think
that we've come really far in replicating
[SPEAKER_02]: that and such a cleaner environment
indoors so yeah I feel like I'm the same
[SPEAKER_00]: way I've grown a lot of fire indoor I
certainly consumed a lot of outdoors well
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years but I don't personally grow
medicinal plants outdoors so at least
[SPEAKER_00]: right now I don't I'm not able to and my
state it doesn't allow it unfortunately
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully that will change some time in
the future but as of right now I can't I
[SPEAKER_00]: would love to grow some medicinal plants
outside but yeah I'm not gonna pick and
[SPEAKER_02]: choose indoor versus outdoor yeah that's a
it's a hard hard question and we know so
[SPEAKER_02]: many people that rock both of them so it's
like I don't want to say who's better
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegas is it Vegas wreck you just can't
grow yeah Vegas is wreck it's basically
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to if you're over 25 miles away
from a dispensary then you can grow home
[SPEAKER_00]: grow up to six plants now if you have a
medical card that's when you're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow up to 12 plants as long as a cultivar
that's you need for your medical condition
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't available in the local dispensary
that's kind of the loophole that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: here and I'm fairly sure that there's no
outdoor growing like it's not supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be outdoors at all like of course not
visible and so on so forth about backyards
[SPEAKER_00]: are so small like I mentioned that
neighbors can easily just look over and
[SPEAKER_00]: see your entire backyard so in most places
very rare to find a private backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're a millionaire you've got
you've got tons of money you can buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge you know private land in the backyard
stuff like that but that's crazy they
[SPEAKER_02]: really really bubbled that around
dispensaries and their profits that's
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy they want money they want the money
they want the tax revenue right yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not right so I do want to get
deeper into plant training I know you kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of touched upon it you said you wished you
did more plant training what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: typically do for plant training when you
grow doors just the same like I keep my
[SPEAKER_02]: plants really clean at first I was pretty
scared to like remove any foliage or any
[SPEAKER_02]: branches just because that's an open wound
in your plant giving pests literally front
[SPEAKER_02]: gate access to inside your plants but I
had an aloe plant outside so anytime I
[SPEAKER_02]: pruned or defolated or anything I would
always rub aloe on those open wounds and
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like help it heal up it also
creates a barrier between the pests and
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant and it it seemed to work out
really well I never had any like um you
[SPEAKER_02]: will probably know there's a pest that'll
like burrow itself is it called a burrow
[SPEAKER_02]: inside your plant stem and like get into
your plant absolutely destroy it so I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like super scared of that so having that
was great and I didn't really do much
[SPEAKER_02]: training outdoors I really wanted to see a
medicinal plant and it's full state
[SPEAKER_02]: because I haven't gotten to in in
firsthand and see it on TV and on the
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTubes but yeah I didn't really train I
usually LSD and I do I have done trellis
[SPEAKER_02]: training or trellis net indoors but I just
wanted to see really really giant plants
[SPEAKER_02]: so I got what I got this year like I said
I would really like to utilize more
[SPEAKER_02]: training to keep them you know closer to
height just easily touchable I had to look
[SPEAKER_02]: a gigantic ladder around outside and it
was fun being up there but really just big
[SPEAKER_02]: old pain so probably some LSD probably do
some stakes ground stakes and have places
[SPEAKER_02]: to tie them off to it's the same old same
old as indoors just bigger sweet I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: circle back to composting now I myself
have a vermicompost bin so I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing I have a small bin indoor in my
garage you got some worms in there and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I started out with the half cocoa
half paper shreds in there and food scraps
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm putting the greens in there banana
peels coffee grounds but I want to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: more about like how you do it now you
mentioned the lasagna method is that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the only way you go about the
composting or do you have like piles and
[SPEAKER_02]: add in food scraps or what do you
typically do yeah the lasagna gardening
[SPEAKER_02]: method can act as a compost pile you can
really just go out there and throw your
[SPEAKER_02]: food scraps with that if you're in an
environment that have like deer and
[SPEAKER_02]: raccoons and all those little critters
like you're definitely gonna want to try
[SPEAKER_02]: and bury that as far down as you can even
if you're just tossing it out there just a
[SPEAKER_02]: little tip but we started our compost pile
I've had my horse for about two and a half
[SPEAKER_02]: years now so when he came we really really
got into it because we had a ton of excess
[SPEAKER_02]: manure and so we put the pallets like
moving pallets around and we made like
[SPEAKER_02]: just two little squares yeah yes exactly
two little base so we just started adding
[SPEAKER_02]: his manure and a course like there's a
bunch of like dirt and all of the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: elements but like also the straws and the
hay two different kinds of case we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: prairie hay and we have an alfalfa hay and
grass clippings and leaves and food and
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that we could really utilize we
threw in there and definitely got hot
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely got hot enough to break down
the scary bacteria and then you just
[SPEAKER_02]: rotate it and I know people like you can
probe it like take your temperatures on it
[SPEAKER_02]: we didn't get that scientific okay just
really winging it out here but yeah it's
[SPEAKER_02]: so crazy so we took that three-year
compost so we moved it to our six rows in
[SPEAKER_02]: the back to top those guys off but just
after turning it and having it for so long
[SPEAKER_02]: this stuff breaks down into the richest
you'd think it smelled terrible but it
[SPEAKER_02]: smells so so good so rich and like so much
like dirt I know that sounds funny but
[SPEAKER_02]: from going from manure to dirt it's just
such a radical process like you can
[SPEAKER_02]: physically hold this and I think we can
all do it now just tell when like that
[SPEAKER_02]: soil is super rich and it's ready to be
planted in versus crumbly crusty or too
[SPEAKER_02]: tight and it's just not plenty full so
like being able to see the difference was
[SPEAKER_02]: seriously not shocking because I knew it
was coming but it's like okay yes we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the right thing you know it was
validating and yeah it's so much simpler
[SPEAKER_02]: than then I think the internet and some
people even tried to make it it sounds
[SPEAKER_02]: really complex on the internet you have to
have all of these elements and you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: probe it you have to turn it a thousand
times and you have to keep it moist to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep everything alive it's not as not as
complex as it seems online so that's our
[SPEAKER_02]: process it's really easy and if we're not
using our food scraps for our compost we
[SPEAKER_02]: feed it to our livestock mostly our pigs
they just go crazy for bucket feed and
[SPEAKER_02]: then they do the whole process and then
they turn that into compost themselves and
[SPEAKER_02]: they push it into our our grass that
they're on and yeah fun stuff that's
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome yeah close the operation I mean
that's kind of a lot of people's goal is
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of get to that to where they're
using their compost as fertilizer really
[SPEAKER_00]: and rewarding I guess is probably the word
that I would use for when you successfully
[SPEAKER_00]: compost something because I had that
feeling before I'll never forget the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time where I dug into my vermicompost bin
like probably about six months after eight
[SPEAKER_00]: months after I started it and just kind of
digging down just seeing that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: black gold a lot of people refer to where
it's just so good and being able to take
[SPEAKER_00]: that and then top dress my plants and then
not have to worry about adding any any
[SPEAKER_00]: additional fertilizers on top of that but
yeah it's pretty cool and I totally agree
[SPEAKER_00]: with you where it's not as hard as people
make it out to be on the internet it could
[SPEAKER_00]: really be simple if you take the simple
approach so yeah well said there I think
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody wants to sound like a little bit
more scientific a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: exaggerated maybe a little bit smarter
than they might be that's how I'm to me
[SPEAKER_02]: but I promise it's not but they try they
want to make it complex so they have like
[SPEAKER_02]: this valuable information you know instead
of just like hey go this is how you do it
[SPEAKER_00]: it's real pretty easy absolutely so do you
have any other advice that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about in this podcast episode or
maybe any maybe some advice for beginners
[SPEAKER_02]: that are kind of just starting outdoor
growing yeah so learn your zones like your
[SPEAKER_02]: gardening zones that's super important for
outside you need to know when you're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: run into your your last frost date and
then your first frost date so you know
[SPEAKER_02]: when to start and when you need to harvest
by and it's more important for your start
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're starting seedlings because you
do not want those to get roast at all if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're your almost ready harvest plants
freeze once they'll be okay believe it or
[SPEAKER_02]: not and learn your pests and what you have
in your environment already you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn you know of course like how much
sunlight you're getting in the specific
[SPEAKER_02]: area that you're looking to grow and be
careful when you're picking strains like
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're in a place like me like sativa
dominant strains do much better than
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica's because they're short squat tight
and that is a really good way to get
[SPEAKER_02]: boisterous or bud rock there's just not a
lot of airflow in there if you can have
[SPEAKER_02]: your soils tested but it's not a hundred
percent necessary put your hands in it
[SPEAKER_02]: feel around again use your resources so if
you don't have manure and you want to look
[SPEAKER_02]: into that side of composting hunt down a
barn with boarding horses go to your local
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer ask your neighbor that has goats
and rabbits because all of that is super
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial and chickens if they can
collect chicken poop for you that's
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderful and start a compost pile outside
or start a compost bin indoors and utilize
[SPEAKER_02]: it please do it you can do it it's fun and
yeah I think just keep it simple and just
[SPEAKER_02]: go do it it will all be okay that's some
really good advice so let's wrap things up
[SPEAKER_00]: tell the listeners how they can find you
and is there anything you have upcoming in
[SPEAKER_02]: the future that you want to talk about you
can find me on Instagram at barely growing
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a bar e le e dot grow in and on
YouTube and I'm also over on Twitter
[SPEAKER_02]: Twitter allows us to share our plants now
so I'll be over there too yeah I think we
[SPEAKER_02]: will be making some not just medicinal
plant content for YouTube and Instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: but we'll also bring the homesteading
content to primarily YouTube and more into
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram to show how both of these worlds
collide and they collide super super well
[SPEAKER_02]: so that is something I'm really looking
forward to and I hope that you guys are as
[SPEAKER_00]: well awesome well I know I will definitely
be following you on your journey and I'll
