video for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what we have Here brand new not even
released yet EC infinity cloud ray s6
[SPEAKER_00]: clip-on fan Developer edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited for this one I actually had
the idea for a clip-on fan that connects
[SPEAKER_00]: to the grow tent clips onto the grow tent
back in 2016 a few years later there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: company that Released one.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the quality wasn't really that
great a lot of people reported problems
[SPEAKER_00]: and of the few I had One of them died out
which the company replaced and then
[SPEAKER_00]: another one that became extremely noisy
over time So not really the best quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this one right here AC infinity is
known for their quality They're certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: changing the game with this one AC
infinity actually sent me over this one
[SPEAKER_00]: and they hooked up my viewers with a

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay now let's unbox this thing All right,
so nice looking box so you have here you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see on the side adjustable tilt
digital 10-speed IP 44 temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity proof On the side here it says EC
motor runs quieter more energy efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: and has a longer lifespan than AC motors
It's IP 44 rated components are sealed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be highly resistant to heat liquids and
dust digital control PWM technology
[SPEAKER_00]: enables a wider range of 10 fan speeds and
UIS compatible connects to UIS controllers
[SPEAKER_00]: for temperature humidity cycle and
schedule programs First thing out the box
[SPEAKER_00]: is a user manual in the user manual as
you'll find some key features installation
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions programming instructions and
warranty information Here is the
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation fan color is black pretty
sleek Very lightweight you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: buttons on the back One is for the
different fan speeds and the other one is
[SPEAKER_00]: for the oscillation feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a power cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty long I believe it's nine feet
long Here is the grip clip So you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: attach the circulation fan to the grip
clip and then you'll be able to clip this
[SPEAKER_00]: on to the pole of your grow tent In this
bag right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few different things an
extension cord There's an adapter dongle a
[SPEAKER_00]: cable tie and a cable mount It's actually
pretty easy to put together all you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do is unscrew this piece that's on the
grip clip You'll slide in the circulating
[SPEAKER_00]: fan slide that piece back through and
screw it together And then it's good to go
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so in my two foot by four foot grow
tent this one's actually by AC infinity as
[SPEAKER_00]: well Clipped it on to the side of the tent
and I'm probably Pressing the button to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it on you can see their lights up on
the different speeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pressed it six times It's on speed
six out of ten if I pressed it an 11th
[SPEAKER_00]: time it would turn the fan off There's a
spot there for the UIS and then the button
[SPEAKER_00]: there for oscillation feature Super quiet
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really shocked by how quiet this fan
actually is Stayed close to the grow tent
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't take up much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I can't say enough about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very high quality I will leave a
link to AC infinity's website down in the
