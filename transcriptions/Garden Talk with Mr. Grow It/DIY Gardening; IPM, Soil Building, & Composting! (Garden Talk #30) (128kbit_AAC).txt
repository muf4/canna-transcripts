[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: With native soil, it really has very low
organic matter and it's more mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: content and that is what our nutrients
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So implementing native soil is really a
way of just unlocking like a savings
[SPEAKER_00]: account of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice holes are amazing for aeration
instead of pumice or vermiculite because
[SPEAKER_00]: rice holes hold water, they break down and
they are 90% silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worms are resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left my worms for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I forgot that I had a whole tote
of worms and I went out there and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year later, I didn't even touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% of all landfills could be composted at
home instead of throwing your food away in
[SPEAKER_00]: the trash where it's going to get buried
in a piece of plastic in a landfill,
[SPEAKER_00]: turn into methane, contribute to
greenhouse gas emissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fed your plant with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saving money and you're saving the
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris aka Mr. Grow It and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Queen of the
Sungrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has been gardening for 11 years and
grows a variety of plants such as
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes, potatoes, onions, buckwheat,
marigold, carrots, beets, and so much
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, we focus on DIY
gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: She talks about things such as building up
the native soil in your backyard versus
[SPEAKER_01]: buying bagged soil, IPM, composting,
and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast on Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by
going to patreon.com slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: the general public.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, and we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Queen of the
Sungrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, happy that you joined.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was what, like a month and a
half ago you reached out to me and you
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about how you have experience doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're on podcasts before and you
have a radio show and you've got all this
[SPEAKER_01]: good information about DIY gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get in this today.
[SPEAKER_01]: IPM, soil building, composting,
just a whole bunch of different knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: today and I'm super excited on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for joining me and for those
that don't know who you are, can you just
[SPEAKER_01]: give us kind of an introduction who you
are and kind of how you got into
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Queen of the Sungrown is my handle on
Instagram and you can find me there or on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a cannabis cultivator and consultant
as well as a UC Davis trained master
[SPEAKER_00]: gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is environmental science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to school for natural science
and prior to getting into the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked for the Nature Conservancy doing
invasive species management and endangered
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically I have just studied a lot
of sustainable agriculture and ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just applied that to my life and
really trying to educate my community and
[SPEAKER_00]: to how we can just be better humans living
alongside plants and animals and working
[SPEAKER_00]: together and doing our thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what's your growth style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you an indoor grower, outdoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you grow in beds, containers,
greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned how to grow inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a medical business back in medical
days in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, this was the typical indoor
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my partner just taught me use a
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow a recipe, all the grow bro stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time I was in college and I was
learning about sustainable agriculture and
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems and how everything is
connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, this is a little strange,
you know, like my lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I am growing inside when I'm in
California, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the number one in the nation for
agriculture outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Prop 64 passed, I was actually
forced to move in order to keep my
[SPEAKER_00]: business legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I moved down the hill outside of Tahoe
to grow and change my whole style to
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the best thing that happened to
me because I am so happy I am not under
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being outside in the sun is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow in native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge proponent of closed loop
systems, regenerative agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: and using what you have on your land to
benefit you the most without having to use
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of money inputs and just trying to
keep it as low cost and efficient as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to get into the DIY type
stuff today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had mentioned earlier, one of the
things I want to start with, which I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought was super cool was on your
Instagram, you have this DIY fruiting
[SPEAKER_01]: hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on your Instagram story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about that real quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically, I kind of like to go
through all of the most popular growing
[SPEAKER_00]: products and look and see what their
active ingredient is and try and find that
[SPEAKER_00]: and do a cost analysis of what everyone's
most popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for rooting hormone, it is Clonix is
what I used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indole 3 butyric acid is the active
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in the oxen hormone group for
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's responsible for cell
elongation and is typically associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is found in most common rooting
hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just did a little research and I
found a 99% pure indole 3 connected with
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was about $27, I believe,
for a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like, I think it was five grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked out to be $1.37 per 200
milliliters versus Clonix, which is $30
[SPEAKER_00]: for the same proportion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're literally saving, you know,
you can use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably have that little bag for the
next five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's so awesome that you're able to
kind of save money that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I saw it was the 200 milliliters is
what your mixture kind of came out to is
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.5% IBA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the comparison was 100
milliliters of Clonix 0.31%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's less IBA than what you're making.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're paying a lot more than $30.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where can they get that IPA?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to powergrown.com, they are a
company out of Sacramento, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: provide all different kinds of plant
hormones and things that you can purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: from them in bulk powder that you just mix
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with this powder specifically,
you're going to want to just make enough
[SPEAKER_00]: for what you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, good little grow hack there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick grow hack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Save some of you guys some money out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a ton of people watching
that love the DIY style stuff and saving
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've seen your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow these massive plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm mostly an indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you're aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have very little outdoor experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoors, outdoors, completely different
battlefields, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about IPM, I mean,
there's several grows that I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: through indoors where I haven't done any
IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get away with it sometimes if
you have, as long as you're cleaning your
[SPEAKER_01]: grower in between and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoors is a completely different
battlefield.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're growing outdoors, what do you
usually do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your IPM routine?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step in IPM for outside is
really just letting go of the expectation
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're not going to have pests
because you're going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that that's part of nature bugs
and really just learning about them,
[SPEAKER_00]: their life cycle, when to expect them,
what they feed on, how many times they
[SPEAKER_00]: molt, what their metamorphosis stage is,
is really just about learning what to
[SPEAKER_00]: expect, what eats them, what they're
attracted to, what predator insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: how you can attract them, and really
encouraging as many species as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: because biodiversity is really the key so
that you don't have an outburst of one
[SPEAKER_00]: species and you can really just keep a
hundred species in a harmonious balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is done essentially through a lot of
companion planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do buckwheat, nasturtium, lemon balm,
daikon radish, and then a ton of other
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinator habitat, just mixed wildflower
seeds all around the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those first few species I talked
about, I actually use within my
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those border the edges of the greenhouse
beds where my outdoor plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all attractors for predatory
wasps, hoverflies, ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those species, it's actually
their larvae that are responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: eating a lot of the pests like aphids,
caterpillars, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really just encouraging a good,
thriving, healthy ecosystem is my first
[SPEAKER_00]: step of IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then being out there, looking,
just seeing what's going on, observing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then definitely de-foiling,
removing leaves, just pulling off,
[SPEAKER_00]: just get as many leaves as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to do a heavy de-foil midway through
each grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, right before harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, depending on the pressure and the
time of the year, I will do sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a whole outline on my Patreon of
different sprays that you can use for
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids specifically, because that is a big
pressure in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: For aphids, for instance, they really just
need to be sprayed with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're soft bodied insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you spray aphids, spray them
with just water, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to use any opportunity I spray
my plants, I use it as an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed them at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So silica is in there because silica
penetrates the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very good defense against
pests, pathogens, fungal, anything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to attack the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a stronger cell wall,
your plant is stronger to resist that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any spray I do, I start with silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a variety of different
things depending on what I'm combating or
[SPEAKER_00]: what time of the year it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use zombie spores, the fungal
spores that will infect the pest and kill
[SPEAKER_00]: them that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those need to be used during the
more humid time of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe later in the end of summer or
early spring when there's more humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the middle of the summer when it's
really hot and dry, those techniques
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't going to work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really just about knowing your
environment, what you've got going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then making the smart decision on what
to spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't encourage using any
pesticides, even if they are organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They accumulate in our waterways.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get eaten and bio accumulate up the
food chain and they can affect birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can affect all different species
around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of like a last case
scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes they will wipe out a lot of
the beneficial insects that you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: as your soldiers, you know, your first
defense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can have this big population
growth of, let's say you're spraying a
[SPEAKER_00]: pyrethrum or something and you want to
wipe out aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're going to go ahead and
they're going to wipe out all the aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they may wipe out all the ladybug
larva as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a ladybug will reproduce only so many
eggs hatched in so much time, whereas an
[SPEAKER_00]: aphid can give birth to four live births a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see this explosion afterward of
your pest and then your predators that got
[SPEAKER_00]: killed off are having a harder time
catching back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really try to stay away from pesticide
sprays, even if they are organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aphids, they're a pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had them on my ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was an outdoor guard for one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, I got lazy with the
IPM, so I didn't spray like I should have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got all the way up to harvest day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, I'm going to have to bok
choy tonight, go outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just loaded with the aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Loaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lettuce was fine right next to it,
but the aphids, they were just buried in
[SPEAKER_01]: as deep as they could kind of be within
the leaves of the bok choy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was disappointing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't slack when it comes to IPM,
especially outdoors, because it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also remember your 10% is kind of like
tithing, you know, permaculture is that
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% rule that 10% of your garden,
you should just expect to give it back to
[SPEAKER_00]: mother earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it back to the pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've ever even heard that
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about root aphids?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've encountered those before and
those aren't something I'm very familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about root aphids and
what you did to combat them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root aphids are a pain in the butt because
they often go unnoticed for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are in the roots and that's
not something that you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so typically you start seeing what
looks like a magnesium deficiency in your
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, that, you know, Christmas tree
pattern, the interveinal chlorosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're like, oh no, am I deficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you find little tiny things
crawling around in your root zone and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what happened for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finally took a plant out to look at it
because I knew there was no way I could be
[SPEAKER_00]: deficient and I found them lo and behold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically I thought, well,
I looked up what eats root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rove beetles are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you watch them, they're running through
your soil, looking for things hunting,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like vicious little killers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting rove beetles in there,
either purchasing them, I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: actually purchased any predatory insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just plant plants to attract them and
create that habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the rove beetles, and then I did
purchase nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just got the triple threat from
Arbico Organics and inoculated my beds and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything with the nemects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, the nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did use nemix as well,
a root drench, and that was only in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that were in pots with root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't recommend doing a root drench
in your living soil beds if you have those
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials like the rove beetles and
stuff like that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are in a small container using
something like nemix, which is from the
[SPEAKER_00]: azadirachtin-based pesticide, it is
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, all of those things I talked
about apply to organic pesticides as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had really good success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this thing called Bosania
bovaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably butchering that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a strain of fungus that you can
also use and that will combat root aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the common name is Botanogard WP22,
I believe, is the product that carries
[SPEAKER_00]: that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's stop talking about bugs and let's
talk about soil building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of gets into the DIY type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of growers, they go to their
local hydroponic store and they buy bagged
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Potting soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you specialize in just using the
native soil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil in your backyard and kind of
reviving that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about how somebody
would kind of go about doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing with potting soil in a bag,
it's really not soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's potting mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is mostly organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that organic matter is going to be
used up within one cycle, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pretty much guarantee that by the
end of that growing season, your plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have extracted everything out of
that bag of soil that it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: With native soil, it really has very low
organic matter and it's more mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what our nutrients are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So implementing native soil is really a
way of just unlocking like a savings
[SPEAKER_00]: account of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order for you to do that,
you just have to build up the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter because that's what you're lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So poop of any form, like, you know,
if you have access to the resource
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation district in your county,
you can get a hold of them and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually deliver free manure to your
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know anyone with a horse or a cow,
you can literally, I've knocked on my
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbor's door and said, hey,
can I bring a wheelbarrow over and shovel
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your poop out of your yard for
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like, yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Composting, that is a huge way of reducing
your waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% of all landfills could be composted at
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine your carbon footprint being
reduced by just, instead of throwing your
[SPEAKER_00]: food away in the trash where it's going to
get buried in a piece of plastic in a
[SPEAKER_00]: landfill, turn into methane, contribute to
greenhouse gas emissions, you fed your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saving money and you're saving the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like win-win right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically whatever form of organic
matter you can get, get your hands on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a waste reclamation center and
the number one thing being thrown away is
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon, think about you get a box within a
box within a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can break down all of your
cardboard, you can use that to build your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally that's carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants will, that will create soil
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got manure, you've got
cardboard, you've got kitchen waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, your, compost another
form you can use is worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worm composting is super easy no matter
where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in an apartment, you can have a
worm bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing with worms is whatever they
eat comes out seven to 11 times richer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you feed your worms, you know,
something with a three, three,
[SPEAKER_00]: three, you know, you're saying in ratio of
NPK, it's going to be a higher ratio,
[SPEAKER_00]: like 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 21, 21, 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that doesn't happen often in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the energy taken, you lose energy
as you go through a chemical reaction or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with worms in this case, you're
actually going to get more out of them
[SPEAKER_00]: than you put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And worms are resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I left my worms for a year one
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot that I had a whole tote of worms
and I went out there and they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: alive a year later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a hands-off gardener,
worms are an amazing option for building
[SPEAKER_00]: up your soil and just getting a hold of as
much organic matter as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking, you know, what people would
consider as trash, that becomes your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are definitely things that you
need to take into consideration when
[SPEAKER_00]: assessing your location for building the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wrote an eight page paper on this
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in the details of
how to analyze your native soil for things
[SPEAKER_00]: like pH, organic matter that is there
already, their NPK, the drainage,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's going to be a huge issue
with growing depending on your,
[SPEAKER_00]: if your soil is silt, clay, or sand,
it's going to affect how they hold on,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it holds onto nutrients, how the water
drains through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are many ways you can determine
this at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a fancy soil test kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to send it to a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just do things through
observation, feel, and a few other little
[SPEAKER_00]: tests to just determine what kind of soil
you have and then how you can build it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just thinking about my soil back in,
I used to live in Massachusetts and just
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about the house I grew up in,
parents backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Digging down, there is sand and it seems
like there's a lot of clay too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always thought like that can't be
used at all with medicinal plants because
[SPEAKER_01]: of, I think it's well known even amongst
intermediate beginners that there needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: be aeration down in the root zone and
having a real compact medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants don't thrive as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are you saying that I could
potentially revive that sand and clay and
[SPEAKER_01]: turn it into something that, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clay is actually one of the best soil
types you can have because it is the
[SPEAKER_00]: smallest particle size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the highest cation exchange
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those particles that are so tiny,
yes, they contribute to compaction and
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of aeration, lack of drainage,
but they are more readily available,
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible nutrients because the particle
sizes are so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really what you need to do is grow some
carrots, potatoes, daikon radish,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow as much as you can and let it die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just throw seeds out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really cheap and as it grows and
it breaks up, then you're building your
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're breaking up your compaction of that
clay, that hard dense pack and in a season
[SPEAKER_00]: you can change it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really good info.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let me ask you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are going to be some people that are
watching this that don't want to wait that
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you recommend people using their native
soil in the backyard and amending it with
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these blends that are out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe Dr. Earth blend or build a soil
blend or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you recommend going that road or not
really?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if you want, so clay
specifically is one of those soils that
[SPEAKER_00]: will take your time doing it the way that
I suggested, but if you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: wait, then you can use a tiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there's this whole thing of no
till till, but in this scenario,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have a lot of compaction and you
want to grow immediately, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend renting a small tiller or a hand
pickaxe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've used.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the muscles and you're willing
to put in the work and you break that up
[SPEAKER_00]: and then buy a yard of bulk compost from
someone, you can buy a bag of this soil
[SPEAKER_00]: mix that you're talking about,
but truly, I mean, it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to ship it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people have local soil yards where
you can buy a truckload of soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: of compost made there in your hometown for
like $40 for an entire yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much those bags are that
you suggest it, but usually a bag of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: is like what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three cubic feet and they're like $10 to
$15, sometimes $20 for a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just thinking if you're going for
efficiency, you want to grow something
[SPEAKER_00]: right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really just getting some good quality
compost from a local source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably your best bet because those
bags often have a lot of vermiculite,
[SPEAKER_00]: pumice, lava rock, stuff like that that
doesn't mix really well with clay that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to the top as you water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to use native soil,
I recommend just getting compost from a
[SPEAKER_00]: local source and using a tiller so that
you can till in the compost with your
[SPEAKER_00]: native soil or the pickaxe or whatever one
of those handheld, you know, when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the three teeth,
prong things that you step on and work in
[SPEAKER_00]: with, I don't know the name of it,
but that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, so the things that the
drainage is going to be completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different in a bag of potting mix to clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you just buy a bunch of potting
mix and you put it on top of your native
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, you're going to get a hard pan layer
because- Well, sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was referring to the non-actual potting
soil from bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more like the nutrient blends,
like down to earth makes a lot of those
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments, like having those amendments,
but they're actually a blend of
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: More of that instead of the potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what you were referencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use down to earth and mix that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely knowing what's in your soil a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know that you're devoid of
nutrients and you need to add things,
[SPEAKER_00]: mend your native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I amend my native soil with a sea blend of
crab, shrimp, oyster with different
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal inoculants, bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice holes are amazing for aeration
instead of pumice or vermiculite because
[SPEAKER_00]: rice holes hold water, they break down,
and they are 90% silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're adding more of that to your plant's
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely amend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying don't amend because
especially in a medicinal crop that eats a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot and if you're trying to get multiple
cycles out in a growing season,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to want to replenish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if it's brand new native soil
that you're just building up because in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to access all of the nutrients,
you have to have microbes there and create
[SPEAKER_00]: that habitat and get that living soil web
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're talking about people who want
to start growing right away, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be unlocked right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minerals need to be cycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to become soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with native soil, you have an unlimited
supply of them, but you need to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how to unlock them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using nutrients up front, your down to
earth blend, or your build a soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever it is that your favorite is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a local farm supply store that
makes their own fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try and always support local as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to be able to spend a lot
less money on amendments using your native
[SPEAKER_00]: soil versus mixing in potting soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great point, for sure.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you said earlier, you don't really
have to do the soil testing side of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some viewers are going to want to do the
soil testing when they're building up
[SPEAKER_01]: their native soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us a little bit about the
testing side of things, macronutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: content or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I literally just published an
eight page paper on testing, doing your
[SPEAKER_00]: own home testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it goes through everything that you
can do at home to do these tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It even links products where you can buy
like a at home NPK test and pH test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it describes how to do these with a
thing called a slurry test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically you're going to take a
glass jar, you know, like a mason jar with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lid and dig down about eight inches in
your native soil and make sure your hands
[SPEAKER_00]: are clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your tools are clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way that any fertilizer could
be on those tools because that will skew
[SPEAKER_00]: your test for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And take a little bit of that soil and
fill your jar up about a third of the way
[SPEAKER_00]: and then fill the rest of the jar with
distilled or dechlorinated water and go
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead and give that a big old shape and
let it sit for a while until it settles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can go ahead and buy an at home
NPK test or if you have your pH pen and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use the solution in that jar and
use a little test strip and you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: out general area of your macronutrients as
well as your pH of your soil through this
[SPEAKER_00]: little at home test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean like 30 minutes, you'll be able
to find out at least if your soil can
[SPEAKER_00]: sustain some life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what direction you need to build it
in, what you need to amend it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, it's really a
generalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've used those tests,
the little like strips, you put it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: water and it'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use them for my pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the same idea and it'll
give you like a color scale of how,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, low, moderate, excessive of
nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your micronutrients, really your
micronutrients, you should have a decent
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of micronutrients in all native
soil because micronutrients come from
[SPEAKER_00]: rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you think calcium, magnesium,
manganese, boron, copper, that's all like
[SPEAKER_00]: from rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other places are going to have more
available than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you live near in glacial
territory, you think about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: people order glacial rock dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in a glacial valley,
you probably have freaking awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live by a volcano, you have that
people get volcanic ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They order it to, you know, but the salt
that, so if you just know a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about where you live, you could have like
a goldmine of nutrients right under your
[SPEAKER_00]: feet and you didn't even know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just doing a little bit of research and
putting that effort in to getting to know
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil goes a long way and will save
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good information there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you sharing that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of touched on a little bit
earlier, but I want to get deeper into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we want to kind of speak more
on beginner's terms, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What you said earlier kind of intrigued
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 40, what'd you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: 40% of waste could be composted,
which is pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all it takes, this is why I'm doing
what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just sit at home and grow my
medicinal herbs and make my money and go
[SPEAKER_00]: my own way, but I want to get it out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our responsibility to take care of
this planet and our responsibility to take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of our waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the government's, you know,
look at what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go on a rampage here,
but we are the ones who make the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so composting is one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can do at home and there's so
many different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically you need to ask yourself,
how much time do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: What resources do you have available to
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And those could be like your space,
how much room you have, how much waste you
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, you know, just figure out how much
you want to invest into your composting
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that will gauge what level of
composting you want to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be as simple, like I said,
on the simplest scale would be worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's literally the easiest way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just get a little tote from Home
Depot, take a quarter inch drill bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: drill some holes in the bottom for
drainage, drill some holes at the top for
[SPEAKER_00]: air, put the lid on, shred some paper,
throw it in there, get a pound of red
[SPEAKER_00]: wigglers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the ones you want for
composting because they live in the top
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and they, the top six inches and they
are really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat their weight like every day in
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, for every square foot of worms
you have, you want one pound of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just take that into consideration of
how much kitchen scraps you've got going
[SPEAKER_00]: on and how many worms you need,
but you can put them, you could do it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tote and the rectangular tote,
or you can do it in a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can leave it in your garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just make sure that it is somewhere that
if it leaks out the bottom that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: okay with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you put a saucer underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is literally like the easiest way
to compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to take it up a notch and
start, you have a lot more that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: available to compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a big yard with lots of yard
clippings or a garden where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly weeding, or if you're growing
medicinal herbs and you're de-leafing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot and you have those materials
accessible, then maybe you want to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit bigger and you want an actual
compost pile in your yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what kind of pests you have
around, if you've got like raccoons or
[SPEAKER_00]: bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the country, so these are things
I have to worry about with compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in a neighborhood where you
don't have to worry about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can have it a little bit more
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either you need to have it enclosed if you
have pests, or you can have it open if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not worried about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just have a pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rule of thumb for composting is 30
parts of nitrogen to one part carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen materials would be your green,
your kitchen scraps, your grass clippings,
[SPEAKER_00]: your leaves, things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your carbon is your dried grass,
your dead leaves, wood chips, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cardboard that you have from Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be exactly 30 to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a nice ratio of the optimal
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way you can determine this is just
having equal volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a five gallon bucket of
kitchen scrap, then a five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: of dry leaves or dry grass, that would be
about 30 to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Combine those, mix them up, and all you
need is a little air, a little water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a little time, and you've got compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make it sound a lot easier than I
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much time, like I said,
how much time you want to put into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are like, okay, I'm going to
go out there, and I'm going to turn my
[SPEAKER_00]: compost pile every day, and I'm going to
water it, and in four weeks, I have black
[SPEAKER_00]: gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like me, I have so many things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a three compartment system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I have one compartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm adding to it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just throwing my kitchen scraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do is when I go to the
grocery store, I get a paper bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I use the paper bag for throwing all
my kitchen scraps in, and then your paper
[SPEAKER_00]: bag is your carbon right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just take that paper bag, and you
throw it into your compartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, okay, bye, done, and you just
keep adding, keep adding, keep adding,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when you've finally filled your
compartment, which ideally three feet high
[SPEAKER_00]: by three feet wide is the ideal volume for
getting the compost going, so I get it up
[SPEAKER_00]: to that point, and then I start watering
it, and I don't add to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have old compost, I will cover the
top of it with old compost, or I have
[SPEAKER_00]: goats and chickens, so I can cover it with
the manure, and really just covering that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of locks in the moisture and gets
things kickstarted and adds the heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: gets the bacteria going and moving,
brings in the microbes from the old
[SPEAKER_00]: compost or manure and really gets things
moving fast, and just making sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: water it is really once a month,
and if it rains where you're at,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you don't even have to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just maybe go put a stick in there and
move it around and make sure it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it starts stinking, then you've gone
anaerobic and you need more oxygen,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really just if you have a pitchfork or
a shovel, go and turn it once a month,
[SPEAKER_00]: and within four months you'll have
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to buy one of those
vermicompost bins with the multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: layers, and I think they're actually like
a hundred bucks on Amazon, but now you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned I can just get a bin locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just buy a bin and do it that way,
so when I'm adding stuff in to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can fill it all the way up and then
just let the worms go nuts for four
[SPEAKER_01]: months, keep it moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I was worried about is
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: At wintertime in my garage, it gets cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets 40 degrees or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there going to be a slow of activity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a too cold of temperature to
where- It'll just slow down in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll slow down, but it's not going to
stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Red wigglers have a huge range of
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll survive down to 20 degrees and up
to 90 degrees, and then they just stop
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get out of that boundary,
they stop reproducing, but they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you put in there, the more
insulation it will have and protect them
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep things warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the upward side of temperature,
I know it can't get too hot and you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: to turn the piles every now and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the general rule for turning your
compost piles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it depends on how fast you
want the compost, how much time you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want compost quickly, turn your
pile once a week and within four to six
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, you'll have compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have time to do that,
if you do it once, it's still,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what, it's going to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on how fast you want it
to, how much space you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a pile that I've only turned twice
this year, but it's shrinking and
[SPEAKER_00]: shrinking and shrinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started out like five feet tall and now
it's two feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't smell, nothing gets into it,
and it's just slowly breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really up to you and how quickly you
want the compost accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're composting for nutrients and
fertilizer, or you're composting to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: your carbon footprint and your waste,
there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you're going to compost now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really hope that I have convinced you
that you will help save the world by
[SPEAKER_00]: composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time we talk, you better have some
harm through something at least.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more confident now because you're
breaking it down in more beginner-friendly
[SPEAKER_01]: manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it seems like there's so many
people out there that it makes it so
[SPEAKER_01]: complex, but you have this talent to where
you're able to explain it a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more easier to where a guy like me can
grasp it pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more confident to start having the
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I taught little kids how to worm compost
at the fair, so they learn, he can learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any other tips for people that
are new to composting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep on adding things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't limit yourself to what you read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how you said, you weren't doing it
because of a limiting belief that you
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it was all this complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go and buy Alaskan humus.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is compost that took thousands of
years to break down all of the things in
[SPEAKER_00]: the forest floor, the poop, the leaves,
the bark, the fish guts from the bears,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just slowly did its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So composting is literally, it could be,
it could take years or it can take weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just play with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say not to add like bones and
meat and fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw it in there and I have five dogs,
so they protect it from like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: raccoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have, like I said, if you got
those things, don't maybe don't throw in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tasty treats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go ahead and try it and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people compost poop like their own
humanure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not a proponent of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to go take dumps in their
compost pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's one more thing I want to talk
about, which I thought was super
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting, uh, before we end this
podcast, which is gardening by the moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you plant according to different moon
phases, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, honestly, it's just interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there, I believe it's Rudolf Steiner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a French guy who came up with
the whole biodynamic movement at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time as the organic movement in the like
sixties happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that, um, you know,
the moon cycle has different poles and
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity, um, that affects water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects the tides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so when you have, you know,
a new moon is supposedly a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: time to plant a seed because the
gravitational pull of water is,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, bringing water to the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're, you've sown your seeds
outside during the new moon, it should
[SPEAKER_00]: stay moist longer because of the gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I don't know if it's a hundred
percent real or if it's a little woo woo,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, I figure our ancestors for
the last 15,000 years, the advent of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, agriculture have been keeping track of
time with the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why not go ahead and give thanks
and work with mother earth and use what
[SPEAKER_00]: the tools that she has provided as easy as
just the sky and why not do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like reading my horoscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not plant my seeds with the new
moon and harvest on full moon?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like biodynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really, I've, I've gone to a few
workshops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually went to a biodynamic composting
workshop where these women literally
[SPEAKER_00]: butcher a cow on the full moon and they
take the blood and drain the blood into a
[SPEAKER_00]: vase and ferment the blood and then take
the ins, the guts and stuff it with
[SPEAKER_00]: digestive medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal herbs, um, like chamomile and,
uh, comfrey and all different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal herbs and they put it in there
and then they bury the intestines with
[SPEAKER_00]: these, uh, digestive herbs and then they
have the, um, the blood fermenting and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they go ahead and they compost all of
this with the moon cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're selling their
supercharged biodynamic compost for $800 a
[SPEAKER_00]: yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about that, but it's out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just when you think you've heard about all
the gardening techniques that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get slapped with something that's kind
of absurd that you would never think was a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, queen, this was a fantastic talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned so much, uh, you know,
about building soil, some cool DIY hacks,
[SPEAKER_01]: IPM composting, which I promise I'll do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we meet next time for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us, how can the listeners find you
and what do you love coming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can find me on Instagram at Queen
of the sun grown and then Patreon also
[SPEAKER_00]: Queen of the sun grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically everything that I talk about on
podcasts and Instagram, I write down and
[SPEAKER_00]: give easy directions, videos, recipes on
my Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I am using that to fund my own
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I love talking about gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the more support I get through
Patreon, the more content I can create for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to save money and grow happier,
better plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will link her Instagram and Patreon down
