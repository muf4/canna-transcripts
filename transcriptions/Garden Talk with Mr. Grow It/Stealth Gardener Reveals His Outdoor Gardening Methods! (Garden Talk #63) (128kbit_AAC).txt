[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually start by going around certain
areas on Google Maps when I want to find a
[SPEAKER_01]: new spot to grow outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut it in a circle so I cleanse in the
middle and then I plant the medical plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in there, so to speak, and then I try to
go out through the bushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just have, you know, a little bit of
a spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're gonna grow outside, I think you
have to be responsible, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: and don't pollute the nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be a grown-up, you know, take your shit
with you or put it in a trash bag nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Choose often plants that are pretty
sturdy, that are known for, they can
[SPEAKER_01]: handle these type of not optimal
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to keep it pretty minimalistic,
take your shit with you, be responsible,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're tuned in to the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 63.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Mackie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for six years and is
a gorilla grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, he talks about the many
stealth practices that he needs to do in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to grow his plants without anybody
knowing.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Mackie.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you man?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk all about
stealth growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are a gorilla grower, which is why
you're hiding your identity right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla growing for those that don't know
is someone who cultivates on land that
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have the legal rights to
cultivate on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be private property,
abandoned sites, areas that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: cared for, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to do that, you have to implement
stealth processes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're going to get into
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, how about an introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in Scandinavia and I've been
gardening for pretty much all my grown up
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started my first grow when I was like
19, now over 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been growing on and off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mostly outside, like real life style.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a little bit of experience in
the outside, growing here in Scandinavia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick disclaimer, we are not
encouraging anybody to break the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is particular for those who
want to implement stealth growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have family, friends,
nosy neighbors that you don't want to know
[SPEAKER_00]: about your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, why not grow legally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you have to grow illegally where
you live?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is how it is here in the
Scandinavian countries with the regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: of the medical plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not allowed to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not allowed to grow it or even have
it on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I started to do this type of
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for other reasons as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's much better to do it
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get contaminated products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had a pre-meeting before we met
today and you had talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination as well is a big deal out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there dispensaries that you can buy
at or is everything just black market out
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything here is black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very restricted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get very big problems if you
use it in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because the black market is so big
here, you get really bad quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I think a lot of people are
starting to implement more guerrilla style
[SPEAKER_01]: of growing because they know what they
get.
[SPEAKER_01]: The black market is just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they try to make the products weigh
more and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, get more money out of
people who don't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a bad market here, I think,
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can imagine that guerrilla growing is
very common out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's more common than people might
know here in Scandinavian countries,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in the summertime, because in
the winter we can't grow here because the
[SPEAKER_01]: climate is so cold and bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit better summer so you can grow
in the summertime here.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is your overall style of
gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing indoors, outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in soil or cocoa, organic,
synthetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your style?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're starting with medium,
I'm usually growing in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: just mixing soil and, you know,
peat and perlite and also some cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little bit of that, but I don't
use only cocoa or only soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mix a little bit of both,
but I never do hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel more comfortable to do it in
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And regarding my grow style, I grow both
indoors and outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in the winter time, winter months,
when it's pretty cold here, I grow
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then in mid-May, I'm starting to veg
the plants that I'm going to put out in
[SPEAKER_01]: the summer months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you're vegging the plants starting
in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when do you actually bring them
outdoors and plant them outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually vege them for four or five
weeks, right before the out-of-flowers go
[SPEAKER_01]: into flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are pretty sturdy and they can
handle some hard winds here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I put them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I veg around eight to ten plants in the
mid of May.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put out them in mid-June.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they get done in like the end of
July, approximately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have already pre-veged another
ten flowers or medical plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you're doing multiple cycles a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned out-of-flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are all the plants out-of-flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I usually do out-of-flowers now,
because the summers here are pretty short.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the weather is not so stable here in
this Canadian country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out-of-flowers, I think, is the best
bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get some quality out-of-flowers,
they could handle these temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some Scandinavian companies
like Norton Seeds that have great
[SPEAKER_01]: out-of-flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they cultivate for these type of
environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you mentioned you're vegging
indoors for about four, five, six weeks or
[SPEAKER_00]: four or five weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants are already flowering when
you bring them into outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're going the remainder of their
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's typically what, like another five,
six weeks until you harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you already have other plants being
started indoors at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once those outdoor plants are
harvested, you're bringing those indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that you have going four or five
weeks outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting another cycle in within
the matter of just a couple of months
[SPEAKER_00]: there between harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to get at least two cycles in one
summer, around 20 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about a place to grow,
how do you go about determining a good
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of land or a spot to grow in?
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually start by going around certain
areas on Google Maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, when I want to find a new
spot to grow outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go about checking the place and then
I see if it's pretty close to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can either walk there or just take my
bike and get a backpack with water and
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition so I can feed the plants when
they need water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go and scout the place and see
if there is a little activity around
[SPEAKER_01]: there, not many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, I don't want any houses
close by so people can see from inside of
[SPEAKER_01]: their houses out and see me when I go in
and out of the area that I picked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, then I just check the area,
see how it is with the coverage of bushes
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hidden, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much sunlight are you typically
looking for that spot?
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to get per day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't have exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really count the hours,
but I think at least like six hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's six, seven hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a minimum here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just try to see how the sun goes
when I'm standing at the growing spot
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, so there's not big trees that cover
the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they mostly get sun, you know,
at least half day, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during the time outdoors, we're
talking June, July, August.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the temperature and humidity
outdoors in the area where you live or the
[SPEAKER_00]: area where you plant, sorry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's getting, you know, this
humidity is rising from month to month.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the middle of the summer,
it's around 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could be more if it's really, really humid
here and really, really hot temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: A really high summer day could,
of course, go up to 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around 45 to 50, I think it's on a regular
summer day here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing anything to camouflage the
grow at all so that nobody can see it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually try to find a spot that is
covered with not big trees, but a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, like a little bit of bushy,
like a circle area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I get in the crowd crawling like two,
three meters in, and then I cut it like in
[SPEAKER_01]: a circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I cleanse in the middle and then I
plant the medical plants in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I try to go out through the
bushes again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just have a little bit of a,
you know, a little bit of a spot or have
[SPEAKER_01]: my plants in the middle so people can see
through the bushes just from above.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always imagine some people actually
doing like booby traps to going as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: like Attigan traps in case anybody were to
walk in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any booby traps you set up or
anything to keep people away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I should, like beard traps and
stuff, but I haven't done anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going pretty good so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you worry about the smell at all,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that these medicinal plants,
they can certainly start to smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That smell can drift over to other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you worried about the smell at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do anything about the smell or
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually haven't got any problem with
the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can choose a strain that is a pretty
low odor strain, like for example the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Lights Auto.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good strain because it doesn't
smell so much if you are concerned about
[SPEAKER_01]: the smell outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where I usually have my medical
plants, it is close to a big road,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bigger road, and there's a lot of cars,
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of stuff going on in the
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty hard, you know,
and it's also pretty windy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty hard for people to notice any
smell there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't had any problems with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it depends on where you put
your plants and how the strain you choose,
[SPEAKER_01]: how much they smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to look up the strain a
little bit before and be cautious of where
[SPEAKER_01]: you plant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a problem that a lot of outdoor
growers face is pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had any issues with plants
accidentally pollinating your plants at
[SPEAKER_00]: all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Never, never actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that is just luck for me
or what it is, but I've never had a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem with that when I'm growing
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty happy about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as kind of going back to
like the camouflage stuff and staying
[SPEAKER_00]: hidden, you know, back in the day,
we're talking 20 plus years ago in the
[SPEAKER_00]: states, there was huge crackdowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was helicopters flying all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were coming down on these grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were looking from above, coming down
once they found these medicinal plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: chopping down plants, and really spending
a lot of time, money on doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you face any of that in your area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there always helicopters flying around
actively looking for gorilla grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: taking plants down?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've never heard of anyone that get,
you know, get in trouble that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never hear any helicopters where I
live here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a big city where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a medium city in one of the
Scandinavian countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have these type of resources
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that they're going to do these type
of big operations, just looking for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, medical plants and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've never heard of anything about
that, no matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you're totally cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, of course, if you have a very,
very big scale operations outside with
[SPEAKER_01]: like 500 to 1000 plants, maybe you got to
be a little bit more cautious,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, but if you have like 10,
20, something like that, I don't think you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to worry about a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing it on a little bit smaller
of a scale than some of the other gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: growers are, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said around 10 plants at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 10, approximately 10, 15 sometimes,
you know, it depends a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: how the place is looking, where I'm going
to set them, if it's big enough or how
[SPEAKER_01]: much do they handle and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you grow in the same spot year after
year or are you switching up locations
[SPEAKER_00]: every year?
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually switch up locations because just
for having a little bit more caution,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and so don't people,
you know, notice me going there every
[SPEAKER_01]: summer and the same time and, you know,
just to try to be a little bit more low
[SPEAKER_01]: key and under the radar and try to switch
it up and try different places,
[SPEAKER_01]: try different spots, see which spot is
best, you know, how the plants peel,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do your initial investigation,
I guess we call it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your initial searching for a piece of
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming you're doing that in May or
maybe early June, maybe a week or so
[SPEAKER_00]: before you plant from indoors,
your indoor plants plant them outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, your auto flowers,
you said they're a week five-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty decent size, I would
imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you bringing the plants into the
location without getting spotted?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually take like bigger plastic bags
that I just can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just carry and then I either go with my
car and just put it in the backseat of my
[SPEAKER_01]: car, just go back and forth a couple of
times in hours that I know another lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people are going there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to make it as quick as possible,
of course, and not be in the location for
[SPEAKER_01]: too long, you know, so people starting
wondering what the guy is doing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bushes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bit weird, but just big plastic
bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on how big the plants are,
you know, I can have some, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like laundry bags, they're pretty high
sometimes, you know, IKEA bags,
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on the height of the plants,
but you know, I'm growing usually auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers and they don't get so tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I usually don't have mega bags,
you know, when I put them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you get the plants to the
location and then are you keeping plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in containers?
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, are you doing the
transplanting process to where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: digging down into the ground and then
transplanting from the containers and
[SPEAKER_00]: planting into the ground?
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, I just put the plastic
containers outside, just on the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: just for easy, because it was a pretty
hidden location that was, I didn't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow them down in the ground, you know,
to make it more stealth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, you know, didn't, you know,
started digging the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends a little bit how the
location is looking, if I want to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: stealth and if people can, you know,
see through it and maybe watch plants or
[SPEAKER_01]: see that something's going on,
maybe I dig them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this year I'm finding a good location
right now and I think I'm just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: put the containers out on the ground,
you know, make it easier for myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do anything for hardening off and
for those that don't know what hardening
[SPEAKER_00]: off is?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doing things to acclimate your plants
that you started indoors to the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing anything for hardening off
of the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly not, but it depends a little bit on
the weather here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have, you know, it's starting to be
pretty good weather in a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: before I put them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I can just put it on my balcony,
some of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really great weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make them accustomed to the outside
climate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: More on the wind and stuff like that,
but I usually don't think about that as
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I choose often plants that are pretty
sturdy, that are known for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can handle these type of not optimal
conditions that is here in where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't had any problems with that to
harden them and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they are pretty good, you know,
when they're ready and they could handle
[SPEAKER_01]: the switch from inside to outdoors pretty
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good, I think so.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you get to the location,
you have your plants there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many trips back and forth are you
typically doing per week in order to get
[SPEAKER_00]: in there with, maybe you're bringing in
equipment or tools, fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: watering the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about all of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: First time I get there, I just put the
plants there, don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get out with it as quickly as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I usually wait for approximately five
days before I go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maximum once a week I go to the spot
and just water them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have bottles in my backpack,
two liter bottles, pre-filled,
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-fertilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can just take them off, you know,
out of my backpack and just splash it on
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical plants, you know, as quickly
as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm out again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, I don't like lurk around in the
spots too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just do what I have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get out there and get out of
there as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every five days, I would say I go to
the spot in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it is a really warm summer and the
plants, of course, need more water,
[SPEAKER_01]: I might get there every third day or
something like that, depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: weather, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what are you using for
fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually just use one fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bloom fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing special.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a brand from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a local.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a local brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't give any recommendations,
but it's a very, it has everything you
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't use that before the,
I think it's the fourth or fifth week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after five weeks, I started to use that
on the plants, but not before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they need it, especially out
of flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty fragile, easy to
over-fertilize these type of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use a synthetic fertilizer when
they're starting to bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually want to put them out the first
week and then I use it every watering
[SPEAKER_01]: until they're ready to harvest,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now are you checking like a PPM or an
EC, or are you ignoring those things and
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of doing the every week feeding
every five days or whatever, how often you
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the site?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't check anything about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not pH, nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just try to keep it as simple as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just taking the recommendations on the
box.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that I know they can handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried it before, of course,
on the spring before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know I don't over-fertilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know my measurements, how much they
need and how much they can take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just mix it up with water and
then I'm out doing the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use any boosters or any stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a simple, you know,
good fertilizer for the bloom stage that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think works really good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it even indoors as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty simple, but it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you have to complicate it so
much if you have a good round fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: basic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can imagine that you've brought in
the nutrients there and you just keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient bottles there on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every five days you're just using
the bottles that you've left there at that
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water, I'm still trying to wrap my
head around because you said you've gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 plants at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water would need to be brought in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing multiple trips for water?
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually just do one trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just fill, but I don't water them that
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give them maybe like 50 centiliters,
60 centiliters water to each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't over-water them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty cautious with how much I water
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for a seven to nine liter
container that I usually use for these
[SPEAKER_01]: out-of-flowers, they don't really need
that much, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't try to flush them too much so
they can hold the nutrients in the
[SPEAKER_01]: container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't flush them up every time and
you just have to use even more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I usually have a lot of two-liter bags,
had a big backpack, just pressing them
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pre-fill it back home so I don't have
any nutrients at the spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just pre-fill everything at home,
put it in my backpack, just go with my
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: My bike or my car sometimes, but usually
my bike, early in the morning,
[SPEAKER_01]: water them and then it's done for five
days usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you said you don't do any type of
flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like to just water in so there's
really no runoff happening for the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about at the end of the grow
before harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: A common technique that we know of is
flushing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll flush the nutrients out of the
medium in order to kind of force that
[SPEAKER_00]: senescence to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing a flush before harvesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've heard that a lot of people do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've also heard that it doesn't make
any sense to the plants if you flush or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like later studies now that recently came
out from really good growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you should, maybe you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard anyone that could tell the
difference from the plants that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: flushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to each person to know if they
want to flush or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually don't care about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I think it's pretty good
that you don't flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why is one thing that's very
common with gorilla growing is you hear
[SPEAKER_00]: about people using synthetic nutrients
outdoors, flushing their plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff of phosphorus and nitrogen,
going to the local streams close by and
[SPEAKER_00]: then toxic algae blooms occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: A huge problem around the world,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's happening due to these
fertilizers, overuse of fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of getting into a more of a
precision thing, not doing the runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really better for the environment,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not having those nutrients runoff
and cause issues.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus is horrible to get down in the
ground, of course, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another thing you often see in
gorilla grows is trash being left around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, this is a mainstream media
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to film gorilla grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to focus on the trash left
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your stance on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you, and you can be honest,
are you leaving the trash hanging around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you collecting the trash?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, of course, I think that's horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to grow outside,
I think you have to be responsible,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, and don't pollute the nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be a grown up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your shit with you or put it in a
trash bag nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to just take every bottle and stuff
like that with me when I go home again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put it in my backpack and then I'm
going off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not that I stay at the spot for so
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just have my water bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I water, then I put them down back in my
backpack and I'm out of there again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have basically anything around
there, laying around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a plan to stand there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think that'd be a tip to stay
stealth, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is to remove the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if people see the trash,
people walk by the area, they see the
[SPEAKER_00]: trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to attract some eyes towards
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So try to keep it pretty minimalistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your shit with you and be
responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you avoid getting spotted?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're going there pretty
frequently, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every five days or so you're going there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you avoid getting spotted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going at a certain time of the day
where maybe there's less population around
[SPEAKER_00]: the area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or have you ever gotten spotted before?
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to go, of course, times where I know
that a lot of people are either at work or
[SPEAKER_01]: sleeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like five in the morning, 4.30
sometimes in the summertime, I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a good time to go there if you're going to
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, I don't take a spot that
there is a lot of houses nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are people, of course,
walking that could see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to choose to be there at
certain times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to put your alarm maybe early in
the morning to minimize the risk of
[SPEAKER_01]: someone seeing you at the spot or maybe in
the middle of the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's better in the early
morning to do it so you can see where your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did mention somewhat high of a
humidity early on in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: At high humidity days, you're at risk for
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you risk a bud rot, mold, powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you facing any of those issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has that happened to you at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's happened a little bit,
but it's not a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some buds that were affected last
year and I just cut them off and just
[SPEAKER_01]: threw them away, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you can't really do anything
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to hope that everything is going
pretty good and that summer is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: windy, but also get a lot of sunshine,
so it gets the air circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around the medical plants that you have
planted outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also maybe you can choose a location
that is not too windy, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: but have a little bit of air circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not so closed off that they can't
breathe and there's too heavy bushes or
[SPEAKER_01]: trees around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not catered, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think it's a bigger problem
inside with bad ventilation that is
[SPEAKER_01]: outside, depending on the weather,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think they're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other problem would be very common
outdoors is pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do in order to prevent pests
from invading your grow outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually put this copper tape around the
stem of the plants because we have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of problem with snails here that likes to
chew on the medical plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I usually just take a pet bottle,
like it could simply be a cola bottle or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, cut it off,
like this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just cut off a bit of the bottle in a
circle and then I just put it around the
[SPEAKER_01]: stem in the lower part and then I take the
copper band around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I put it on all the plants so they
can't like climb up on the stem and chew
[SPEAKER_01]: on your plants, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically the one thing I always
do and it helps a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, you can't do everything and
I don't want to spend too much money on
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things and pest control and yada
yada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the only thing I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going pretty good, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, talking about plant training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll flip it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any type of training at all in
plants, whether it be any low stress
[SPEAKER_00]: training, topping, supercropping,
fimming, any of the training techniques at
[SPEAKER_00]: all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I usually did more back in the day
with the techniques, but I have noticed
[SPEAKER_01]: that I don't know if this is, of course,
some plants can handle it better than
[SPEAKER_01]: others, but if you, for example,
fill more tops on auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, they get more branches, they get
more bud sites and of course, but
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes I feel that the buds are too
like, they're not so hard, what do you
[SPEAKER_01]: call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dense, not so dense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so dense, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the less you do to stress the plant,
I think that's better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you get a little bit less of an
outcome, so to say, when they're ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, maybe just some fimming
sometimes I do, but I don't really low
[SPEAKER_01]: stress the plants I put out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just fimming, something like that,
something easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to spend too much time on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to stress train them.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big are these plants actually getting
before you, like when you harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: how big are the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, as you know, auto flowers don't grow
as big as photoperiod plants, so they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not huge monsters, but of course,
they grow a little bit bigger outside than
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So around 120 to one and a half meters,
I think it could be approximately how big
[SPEAKER_01]: they get outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've seen, for my growth at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, you get to grow bigger auto
flowers and for smaller as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: but around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so you make that decision to
harvest the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you harvesting all the plants at the
same time and then doing trips back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth on the same day in order to remove
the plants from the site?
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to harvest the same day,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, of course, they're the same
strain, but of course, they can
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiate how long in the development
the plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I usually try to harvest the same day
or each other day to minimize me going
[SPEAKER_01]: front and back, front and back all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it makes the potential that
someone might see me, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I just harvest them every plants
in one day, hopefully, and then I put them
[SPEAKER_01]: down in like black sacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plastic bags, bigger plastic bags,
then I get out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I usually wait some days and then
I take the plastic containers with me
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just clean the spot a couple of days
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you bring them back to your home,
let them dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically do for drying
conditions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually have a spare room where I live
and then I have my window there on the
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit half open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I hang it just straight down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have for the curtain pole, I just hang
them there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have a fan that's just blowing
through the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I have some like odor control
buckets of some kind that I usually place
[SPEAKER_01]: out around them, so it doesn't smell so
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it works pretty good,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very minimalistic, you know,
but you know, what can you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you do a wet trim or a dry trim?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always dry trim, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always dry trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just take the bigger leaves off first
before I hang them up to dry so it gets a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit better aeration between the
plants and the stems so they don't touch
[SPEAKER_01]: each other and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they're dry, usually just
five, six days, I think then they're
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually the same process, putting them in
glass containers or in the other process
[SPEAKER_01]: with curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get deeper into curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're putting them into glass
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size containers are you working with
and are you doing any of the burping
[SPEAKER_00]: process, you know, the common process
that's used?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many liters are there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're around 1.8 liters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a mason yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are containers with extra lid on top
that I usually use, glass containers
[SPEAKER_01]: always.
[SPEAKER_01]: After six days, before I cut them down and
trimming the buds, after six days I put
[SPEAKER_01]: them down in the containers and then every
day I open them for at least an hour first
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I close the lid again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second week I do it less
frequently and just feel the buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: see how they react to your curing process,
just smell them, look for eventual mold
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you feel that they're pretty moist
still, maybe you should keep the lid off
[SPEAKER_01]: for longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's up to each and every one to just
feel the flowers and see how they react to
[SPEAKER_01]: your curing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to give a recommendation,
but I just go on feeling basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: see, feel, smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how they react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you eventually packaging up and
selling locally or are you growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mostly grow for myself and some
friends can get something if they want,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't sell big scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just for me myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people take a beer to relax and I can
take something before I go to bed to calm
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if you have a stressful life
like a lot of us do with work and family
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff, it's just a real excitement for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely relaxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is for sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went through just about everything
there in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to ask you for those that are
looking to implement stealth growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be a nosy neighbor that they
want to hide it from, a friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: family member.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any general advice for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you should first of all read a
little bit about it on the internet before
[SPEAKER_01]: you start something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some knowledge before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be pretty cautious where you buy the stuff
that you need to do this and don't say
[SPEAKER_01]: anything to anyone if you're going to do
this the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell anyone, not your friends,
no one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it in your own spare time and don't
overcomplicate things and buy a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers from different brands who just
want to sell your stuff to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy something from a well-established
brand that knows where to read a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit about the company and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scout the location and everything like
that beforehand a couple of months before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at people around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they walking or a lot of people
around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have easy access to the growing
space that you choose outside?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have to take your car there and
stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to keep it as close to you as
possible, minimalistic and be cautious of
[SPEAKER_01]: course.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of advice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrapping things up, any final words that
you have before we end this podcast?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say thank you for letting
me into the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a pleasure and I hope everyone
is growing some good stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone has any questions, they can just
mail me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put my mail down in the
description if you want or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: just say hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to help if anyone has any
questions about this style of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Mackie, thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has definitely been insightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something new, something different from
what we've had on the podcast before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for reaching out to me and
