[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,

podcast, this episode number 156.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Dave Baker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for five years and
specializes in growing auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks all about how he grows auto
flowers in this episode, and there's quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a few things that he does that I haven't
heard of other people doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're into growing autos,
this one is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about a variety of different
things, such as lighting, nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, and so much more.

[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you, Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're in the chat quite often for
From the Stash, and I see you in the
[SPEAKER_00]: comment section a lot on different videos,
a member of the community for a while and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of real great support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you reached out to me and wanted to
come on the podcast, talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're big into autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you said you do photos a little
bit, but your bread and butter is
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers, and that's what you want to
focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do an episode on autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds great to me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, before we get too deep into it,
can you give us an introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Dave Baker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name of the grow company we use is
called The Mad Scientist with a D.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a partner, his name is JT,
and we've been friends for 30 plus years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of work together really well,
so it works out great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting growing, I've been around since I
was 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I mean, you know, the medicinal
plant that we all love and talk about all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't start gardening until about
five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife would have been 29 years a couple
of days ago, passed away about three years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago from leukemia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I quickly became a single dad of
two kids, two young guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're older, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was a schoolteacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So gardening wasn't very easy for me
before then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once it became legal to garden in your
own house, I was cool and she was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started and I started the first one I
ever did was autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had no clue what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a blurple light, a four by four tent
from China.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had no clue about anything, just.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two friends, Jake and Jay, that having
gardening a long time and they took me
[SPEAKER_01]: under their wing and they showed me quite
a bit and I owe them a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out in Maine now and I started
going and I just did everything trial by
[SPEAKER_01]: error.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard at first, then I started to really
understand the plant after a few runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried my hand at some photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some stroging.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to grow all different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, I was using soil,
so hum actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just I hated the fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just kept showing up all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started digging deeper into YouTube and
looking for other ways to grow autos,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to ways to grow big orders.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first auto I grew, believe it or not,
was four and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good size plant for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, that was a while ago,
but there were people saying, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a tiny plant, whatever, and it
really got a bad reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided I was going to dig into it
more and I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came up with a different style that most
kind of a mishmash of commercial and
[SPEAKER_01]: homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boom, I harvested this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I harvested three autos over one pound in
a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, oh, I got something here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's led to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we at now, just growing autos and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying all different types of genetics,
trying all different types of feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: types and schedules and light schedules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the mad sciences came
from, because I'm one of those people that
[SPEAKER_01]: can never leave anything alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always think there's a better way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in doing that, being an outside the box
thinker, I've I've tried all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would laugh at me and say,
are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you're not crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how I got started.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know Massachusetts legalized back
in 2016, if I remember correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: rec it was the same year that Nevada did
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I currently live right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember I was like so pumped up
back in the day when that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there have been so many amazing
growers coming out of Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is a pretty decent climate
to live in, you know, and I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as like the humidity and stuff like
that and outdoors, it thrives,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, during the summertime and yeah,
there's really good stuff coming,
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of mass and autos outdoors do
great because you can plant them in April
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're done the end of June.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or early July, and then you can get
another run in before October.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do two runs and you do all
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that why you prefer autos over photos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are there other reasons for that as
well?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an underdog guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always wanted to be underdog.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just kept doing my research on auto
flowers and they got such a bad rap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, Oh, everybody kept going
back to the old days with low rider.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, you got an ounce if
you were lucky, it was 8% THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was determined to do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best one I've had tested in so far was
Brother Mendel's Mastioda.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew that last summer, four of them in a
four by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys actually showed it on Show Your
Stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I got kind of introduced
to you guys that way because Rob was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: those autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, they're autos,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't even my new light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an HLG light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was 2.2 pounds of autos in a four
by four on one light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had that tested and it was 28% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had 2.5% TERPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, if autos can do that,
why would I grow anything else?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can be done with autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do two runs a year and relax the
rest of the time and breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's my goal is to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have little projects going,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autos have changed so much over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I first started growing back
in 2010, like you kind of mentioned is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it has a bad rep, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like low rider was like the,
what everybody kind of talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just gotten better and better and
better over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, I mean, you can grow massive auto
flower plants, great quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's hard to say that's an auto
and that's a photo, like trying to say
[SPEAKER_00]: which is which.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's hard to tell the
difference these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done the taste test with friends,
roll two, one photo, one auto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me the difference.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're growing these autos,
what is your kind of overall gross style?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing both indoors and outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in, I think you mentioned you're
done with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it cocoa that you're in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what about like organic or
synthetic or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I, when I do grow outdoors in the
spring, in the summer, it's soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a soil that this is going to be the
third year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just re-amend it and get it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's a pretty organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more, I would say a synthetic grow in
my grow area is in the basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a five by five, a four by four
and a two by three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the four by four has got holes all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use it for drying and it works
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The five by five is a new AC infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my Christmas present last year to
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the, I love the tent, but getting
used to a four by four to a five by five
[SPEAKER_01]: is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot more space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it took a little bit, but I,
I got it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I, my style is very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use that Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start out with a little Rockwell pellet
and that's where I put the pop seed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes into either a four inch on
the, that I'm going to use or a six inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've moved over to the six inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put that in and I will feed,
I will hand feed that twice a day,
[SPEAKER_01]: two and a half ounces for the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a seedling.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as it gets its second set of
leaves, I will go to four ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as the roots break
through, it will go on top of an eight
[SPEAKER_01]: inch mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it a big mama.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put them on risers inside of the
water catching circles there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what they're called.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does a little stack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have the, you'll have the water
catcher, the riser, the eight inch of four
[SPEAKER_01]: or the six inch, and the plant will start
to grow through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, usually it'll take about four weeks
and it's already coming through the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: of the eight inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how fast those roots grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I trim them at an angle so that they're
not dangling anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I stay on top of the trimming of those
so that they start, they can, it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: new growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I do that is new to
the game is my light has separate far red,
[SPEAKER_01]: seven 30 nanometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from seedling until second week of
flower, that's on a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does is it stretches the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with autos, if you don't get right away
immediately, they don't start to grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not healthy right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them and start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you're going to get a miniature
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I'm doing it doesn't happen that
way because using the far red will kick
[SPEAKER_01]: them into overdrive to stretch quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll get your big plants stop moving
and moving and moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you kick it down,
I'll kick it down to 40% the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: way until the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll crank it up cause it's great
for a chlorophyll and photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does add more leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leafage, you'll get a lot of, you'll get
big, big, big, big satellite leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had them bigger than both my hands
put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as you stay on top of those
and give you a middle of space,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do any topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do any LST, which there was like,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know me and pigeons are the total
opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but I do leaf tucking and I
stopped that immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I stopped the leaf tucking and the
stretching, now those plants are eating in
[SPEAKER_01]: turbo mode because they're auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at a photo and an auto flower
photo, you can keep in veg as long as you
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can limit your feeding and the plant
will steadily grow until it maxes out
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can flip it or whatever you want
to do, or you can flip it right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people I know flipping it in flower
one week, but autos are kind of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of call them plants on steroids
kind of because you've got to feed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feed them like they're growing because
they grow so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as they're on a seedling stage,
I'm in 100% feed mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're at 2.3 EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as they get the flower,
they're at three EC and they stay that way
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I can tell in three weeks if I
have a good plant to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I don't, I'll kill it,
call it, start a new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to keep it perpetual so that
once I'm in, like I'm two or three weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: away from harvest, I'll stop my new beans
in the corner of the tent, let them go,
[SPEAKER_01]: get them rising, feeding them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's a lot because I don't use
an auto feeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I feed by hand twice a day,
once in the early, early late morning and
[SPEAKER_01]: once around 11 at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I set my, I'm sure you're going to
want to know about light schedule a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll go right into that for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My light schedule is crazy and it's
because I've tried so many ways to see
[SPEAKER_01]: what I can coax out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've settled down on and what I've
been using now for about a year is
[SPEAKER_01]: seedling into the second week of edge is
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second week of edge into, uh, I would say
two weeks before harvest, I am at 18,
[SPEAKER_01]: six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next three weeks until they
get done, I'm at 24.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 20 and four, so 20 on four off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find that the 20 and four,
um, when you're giving them a ton of DLI
[SPEAKER_01]: and PPFD, that's when those, the nuggets
really harden.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really get strong and, and grow a lot
of, a lot, a lot of, uh, of smell and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, and, uh, trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've, that's all by trial and error.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I got it down and these last
three plants that I had harvested came
[SPEAKER_01]: through, like they did, I said,
I've got something here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they were three different genetics
by three different breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there wasn't a coincidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it that way on purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's, so when I feed, I feed to run
off every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once they start to run off,
I'm done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to watch the next plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, like I have a grow going,
uh, they are in week where they're on day
[SPEAKER_01]: 45 and I'm, they're already taken over
1500 milliliters twice a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people would use 1500 milliliters,
maybe once or twice a week with August.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't get them to fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now auto pots help because they take what
they want, but you're not in control.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in complete control of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can crop steer it any way I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the scientist stuff came
from because it's, it's playing it around
[SPEAKER_01]: and finding the right thing because it's
not your average plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely have a unique style when it
comes to the growing the autos,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly with like the light schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really hear about a lot of
people growing autos and rock wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of to back up a minute here,
you kind of talked about what you do for
[SPEAKER_00]: an EC, what nutrient lineup are you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran Jack's one, two, three for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a powder, uh, has an A and B and
then, uh, you use Epson salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, to go along with it, to take care of
the cow map.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I liked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, I've done some really good draws
with it, but I found that the turps
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't as good as I wanted them to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would steer it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd add a lot of inputs, change it up and
it would be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd have effects, but it just wouldn't
have the flavor I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've done some research and run this
run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for the first time, I'm, I'm,
I'm trying cross off newts and I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust to them a little bit because I
think they feed a little light.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has, um, he has the auto flower,
uh, specific, the Bonnie and Clyde to go
[SPEAKER_01]: along with his line there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I know he's a friend of, uh,
one of the other YouTuber guys,
Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matter of fact, I think Luke who won the
grow off thing there, I think he uses
[SPEAKER_01]: prognosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I find it, it's, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had to up the amount because the EC
wouldn't come close to where I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like if they said, start out with four
milliliters per gallon, I'm doing five
[SPEAKER_01]: because I want my EC to be where I want it
to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what the, what the plant can
uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have a friend, uh, we're pretty
tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, um, he owns speed run seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Ben Koch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have some of the best auto flower
seeds I've ever come across.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's an agronomist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he helped me figure out a basis on the,
on the, uh, on the feeding that would work
[SPEAKER_01]: best for autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he's grown 300,000 of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of got a little advantage there
learning that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause from an agronomist, cause I couldn't
figure that stuff out on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: With those ECs that you mentioned that you
were running, you said 2.3 EC and seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.0 EC when you're in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's going to come as a surprise
to quite a few folks that are listening
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I want to do the conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I got a conversion chart up 2.3 EC
is 1,150 PPM on a 500 scale PPM meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the 3.0 EC is that a 1500 PPM,
which is about a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: reaching for that in the flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you hear about auto flowers being more
of a light feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that's a misconception?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, there's a reason like,
uh, Lynn autopotamus, him and I talk and
[SPEAKER_01]: like he said, sometimes he'll have to fill
his reservoir twice a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're up taking what they want,
but they take a lot to get an auto flower
[SPEAKER_01]: to go from its normal four to five ounces
or whatever, to get it to 19, 20 ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to feed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you see a six foot three kid in
eighth grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not eating fruits and vegetables all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's the same growth system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've always looked at auto flowers as
you got to get just as much food into an
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flower and half the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a photo period and you got to do it
one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, with Rockwell, you can't
over water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can give it as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just drains right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has Rockwell has tons of air in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my, that's something I left out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put in a, I mixed 20 gallons at a
time, uh, in a, in a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have two air stones in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for 15 minutes before I feed,
I'll go down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn the air stones on, mix it,
let it go, get bubbles going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always auctioned the oxygenate my food
and my watering because that creates more
[SPEAKER_01]: air.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more air you get to the roots of an
auto flower, the faster and more rapid it
[SPEAKER_01]: will grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because an auto flower is a little
different than a photo when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: expanding roots and auto flower wants to
grow straight down right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it will branch out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what happens with a lot of guys
when they go to transfer from like say a
[SPEAKER_01]: solo cup to a five gal or a three gal with
an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to do that within the first seven
to eight days of his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get to the point where that root is
around the bottom, it's too late,
[SPEAKER_01]: start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it a bunch of times and it won't
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it'll be this big and it'd be that
big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not something you want to waste
all that food and time on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you can get it so they grow
straight down and it doesn't stop and
[SPEAKER_01]: start watering the sides around the six
inch block on the eight inch block,
[SPEAKER_01]: now they start to come back up again and
they swirl around the inside of the rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rockwell, I've broken them open after
they're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of roots is insane,
but it, it, it covers everything in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much room in there for it to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it just allows it to keep growing
and growing, you know, bigger roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, in my experience, same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've started autos in the solo cups and
once that root hits the bottom and starts
[SPEAKER_00]: circling around, you know, even if you
transplant at that point, I've always had
[SPEAKER_00]: like just autos that were, I would say
stunted, but yeah, they flower pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, like a little bit quicker than
they really should.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why you hear a lot of
people be big proponents of planting
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers in their final container,
not transplanting at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, although, you know, my friend Ben from
speedrun would say, I transfer,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I transfer pots all the time,
but he knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's grown 300,000 autos in his life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a huge farm with autos everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you got to do a Fino hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, I can probably do like
four, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick the best out of the four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be very small with that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned some of this from another guy on
YouTube years ago and he's disappeared and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm just, I'm, it's, it's bad to
disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a really good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some high guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever seen him?
[SPEAKER_01]: He started growing in the rock wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to do cocoa core and he's grew
some big autos and people were onto him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's from Washington state and he grew a
doctor Crippley's, um, incredible bulk,
[SPEAKER_01]: the 2.7 pounds live on air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the whole grow was live.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a vlog every week and, and put it
on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the biggest auto flower I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal is to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of the incredible bulk before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think it was, uh, ugliest medicinal
plant you've ever seen, but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: he claims it was phenomenal smoke guy
named girl pot cheaply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've ever heard of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He way back in the day, incredible bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember seeing his and this big,
big plant, huge buds on it, just
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of hard to manage, but big,
big yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high orbit I just ran that I
harvested, uh, six months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was from Mendel brothers and,
uh, I was an Indica, but she grew,
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't stop her from growing and she
didn't have a lot of leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, I didn't have to do any
stripping or anything, really a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had just single buds on that five,
six inches long.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that ended up being, uh, like 19 and a
half ounce plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the base on a Christmas like this
is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do use, I forgot to, I do use silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the entire grow at a low rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the first thing that's mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I, I should say this too,
when I mixed my nutrients, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't just pour it in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have little Intel lab, uh, scientific
little thingy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put the jar on top with your nutrients
in your water and you put the little bar
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bottom and you hit the button in
it, it makes it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll let everything mix for like a
minute, minute and a half before I add it
[SPEAKER_01]: to the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you if you're using any
additives on top of the crock nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it just a silica that you're using
or using other additives?
[SPEAKER_01]: I use their whole line right now,
which is the armadillo, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the Barney and Clyde,
which is the, uh, the veg and bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have them, uh, monkey bandit,
I think it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for like, uh, flavor and
stickiness and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so they have a nice little lineup
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and they had used their CalMac,
but I also use a flavor from from George
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, but it's so darn expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought a little four ounce bottle and
that usually fills a whole 20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to buy it every couple of weeks
or so, but I only, I run it three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll run a whole bottle in three
different mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the end, I do use flower
stacker, which is one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: things from humble secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always worked phenomenal for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I alternate, um, I alternate sugary
from, uh, what the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the name of the company
and I run, um, honeycomb from,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll interchange them one week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll run sugary one week on honeycomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of do the same thing,
but a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And using that trifecta little by little
has now helped the turps get to where I
[SPEAKER_01]: want them to be in my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've, I've mastered getting them large.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to grow a pound plan every
time, but I look at it as if I can get two
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I want flavorful
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and using those inputs back and forth,
changing them up, the plant doesn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: used to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't start to taste just like that
input.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of the little,
I just came up with it myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: just messing around with a few grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last run I did the pound dog and
the Triscuit and the, um, high orbit,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, all were over a pound and they all
were very flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do use grow bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using grow bags since they came
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'll let them cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: My house dries fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even have them in their own tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a fan in there and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it stays right around between 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five and 62 on both.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stays right in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's about eight days and they're
ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a moisture meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go in and hit different buds from
different parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll tell me if it's under 12%,
I'm pulling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and then I will let it cure for
21 to 25 days, depending on what I think
[SPEAKER_01]: is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are using the Kronk nutrients base
and then additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sugary is by cutting and solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutting and solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually a pharmaceutical grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually food grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually drink that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, have you done it?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, uh, it actually does a nice job.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, um, my local hydro shop guy turned me
on to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, I use it in every one of my
grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it a whirl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a couple of runs with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's here to stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once something's here to stay,
I'm not messing it up, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like to tinker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I changed a lot about how much I use and
stuff like that to see if there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I do use the, the far red to,
uh, to do a lot of changing the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people call it crop steering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just call it changing the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I'm not going to,
I'm not going to mainline an auto,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mainline an auto, you're going to get
like six little buds about this big and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm going to leave them alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the key is let them grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody wants to touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to pull this off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to strip the bottom and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an auto flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to allow it to mature as quick
as it possibly can and grow as much as it
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly can before you start doing all
that stuff or you'll stunt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you stunt it, it's might as well
start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got three beautiful ones in there
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one that I messed up and she don't
like me right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's three weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to kill it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take what she is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that happened in the second week of
the third week, I would have restarted and
[SPEAKER_01]: I do use the, the paper towel method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned you're very hands off when
it comes to training, no topping or LST.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just doing leaf tucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing that a lot of people
talk about is that they say that topping
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant auto flowers in particular
significantly can stunt its growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore put the flower and you just got
this small yielding plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you agree with that or disagree with
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to hit them exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to top autos, you got to do it
in the right timeframe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing as transplanting, you know,
you've got to, as soon as they get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: third node or fourth node, you better top
quick and make sure they've grown some
[SPEAKER_01]: before you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not six inches tall already,
if you do it, they're going to stay six
[SPEAKER_01]: inches tall or they'll grow a little bit
and you'll get a couple extra tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you leave tuck, it does the same
exact thing without interfering with the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you like Zaza says all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing you look for is vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well in auto flower, that can't be a truer
statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want something that takes off like a
month, like a dot goes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's when you'll start saying,
Oh boy, I got a big girl on my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to slow down the growth
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you correct me if I'm wrong,
you're not doing any lollipopping or what
[SPEAKER_00]: about defoliation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you pulling leaves off at all or just
tucking five to six leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I can keep the top open,
the middle clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do usually right when they start to turn
into little flowers, little buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: free flower, that's when I'll do some
lollipopping on the bottom and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the autos that I grow grow really
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's usually about that much on the
bottom of stem with nothing on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my plans are to, I'm just waiting till
they come in to stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I'm getting the under canopy lighting,
because why waste any part of the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get a buds on the bottom and a
buzz on the top and you can cut your
[SPEAKER_01]: lights, that's a lot of people say,
Oh, it's too much light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it's done is you take your main
light and you cut the power to half of
[SPEAKER_01]: what you normally would use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you don't need to use it because
you've got to do the same thing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: under under canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do that coinciding with each
other, you got a plant that's giving you a
[SPEAKER_01]: buds all the way up from the top to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to change the growing style for
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, between everything ACI is coming
up with and their awesome AI and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that they just come up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these lights that are doing things
that people have never seen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: The home grower is going to make,
is going to do real well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get, it's going to make it
simple for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it is kind of cheating, but that's
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't cheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't win.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a lot more hands off,
a lot more automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been using their controller
69 because 69 pro and now I'm on the AI
[SPEAKER_00]: controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it just gets more and more hands
off when it comes to having the controls
[SPEAKER_00]: and with the AI thing, you don't even need
to do the individual components,
[SPEAKER_00]: the criteria for each individual
component.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just press the start button and it
goes, you know, just say it's in seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: or you say it's in flowering and it just
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the jury's still out whether how well
that worked compared to manually doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think over time, the machine
learning, I think it should hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers crossed that it evolves to where
it is truly making the best decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whether it comes to bringing the
air in, turning on a humidifier,
[SPEAKER_00]: turning off the dehumidifier, whatever
components you have within the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that they have an auto flowering one
that you can choose to that on the menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I got to, I got to, I'm going to have
to play with that when I get one because
[SPEAKER_01]: will that give me the light that I want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will that give me, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will that work the way I want it to work
to do what I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I have to override some stuff to
customize it to the way I want to it is
[SPEAKER_01]: the lighting that I use is strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people will say, you're not
bird in the tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had burnt tops because you just
have to, you have to play with the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, I finished my last run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, and the PPFD on my canopy was
1350.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was all the light was only at
85%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was 30 inches off the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, once they grow humongous,
I have to do it a little closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll turn it down a little bit,
but the DLI, I try to shoot for 40 every
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want max DLI and people don't realize
they say, oh, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go outside and grow outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun's natural PPFD at two o'clock in
the afternoon is like 2300.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what makes you think 1300 is going to
hurt your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do it right, it's going to give it
all that stuff it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow with light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as you keep the distance away,
you don't want, you know, two inches up
[SPEAKER_01]: at, you know, 90% and you're going to burn
the heck out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't had that issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I get a good fade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they must like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you mentioned towards the
beginning of the episode, how you focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: red spectrum for the autos to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get that stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get that vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I don't really hear
about people doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's kind of a, you know,
another unique approach to growing autos
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular is you using the light
spectrum in order to kind of get that
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch and just to reiterate your light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had mentioned 24 hours for seedling
into veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then did you say it's an 18 six you go
to and veg to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the end of flower is a 20 hours
on four hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of goes with the progression
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to kill them with too much
light when they're babies because you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: stress them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the PPFD, I keep two 50,
300 when there's seedlings and I keep it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep the light like 30 inches above them
so that there's no, the PPFD is there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're not going to cause any burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I get into veg, I want to be
350 to 600 depends on right in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I go into flower,
I'm a thousand plus and I do use a TNB
[SPEAKER_01]: container that I usually fill twice during
the run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have so much CO2 down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down there twice a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: My laundry is down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my kids down there all the time and I'm
down there doing laundry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have dogs that are down there all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I leave the Thames open a lot too,
because it's a basement so it can get the
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity can get messed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with autos, that's another thing is I
have to worry about the tent being open or
[SPEAKER_01]: closed to get the same amount of light
either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can make it breathe in my have an
old furnace and it shoots off CO2 a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so my CO2 is I don't have to worry
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the things that's going
to allow you to intake that more light,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is, you know, people are probably
scratching their head a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how is this guy doing over 1300 PPFD?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a ball add up to CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the other factors, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you've, you've increased your
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into environment conditions a
little bit temperature, humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you running high temp and humidity as
well?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of intake that more light
or what's your strategy for temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: I found that auto flowers love 80,
60, 80 degrees, 60% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll stick with that up until maybe
second or third week of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will try and drop it down to
around 72, 73.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never want to go into 70 because auto
flowers, they don't love the cold that
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then far as humidity goes,
I'll try and get it down to 50 during
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that usually gets me that fade I'm
looking for and, uh, gets the
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's an auto flower,
so it's going to show up lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have an orange spot here and
there, a brown spot here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just part of auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I've never seen a
perfect one, you know, and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody else who grows them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll tell you the same thing that you're
always going to have some blemishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them might start off a little
wonky looking, uh, and then they end up
[SPEAKER_01]: being huge and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just a different plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different phenome, a different
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it has different expressions,
you know, and somebody can say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got an OG Kush, a photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got OG Kush of auto.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be totally different and
they're not going to look the same because
[SPEAKER_01]: you have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: What phenome, what parent, what mother,
father's cousin, brother, you have no
[SPEAKER_01]: clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it smokes good, it looks good and
tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how I look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm working on a little breeding
thing myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not way near where you guys are at,
but, uh, I took the master Yoda and I
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated it with a original age strain
that I got from, uh, AGC co Mark and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a 19 week long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even realize that when I did it,
but I did it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now once I've now left on that,
I've got to rerun it and hit it with
[SPEAKER_01]: something like a fast flowering on a
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that's like a 65 day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got a lot of frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think I will have a pretty cool
strain when I'm done promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the space to do a huge
phenome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll shut down my tent like you
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm done growing for the year and
I'll do a breeding project in it and I
[SPEAKER_01]: could probably put like eight to 10 in one
gals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And just see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would do that in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't do that in well, rock wall or
dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do it with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've actually ventured into the
breeding aspect of auto flowers in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's arguably a little bit more
challenging than breeding photo periods,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the process for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you walk us through the steps that you
took in order to really breed NATO?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seeds that you get are actually all
auto.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from what I've understood, and I,
I, I, I study a lot of genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I study a lot of Zaza.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have a friend who, who was the
head of cultivation for a commercial grow
[SPEAKER_01]: for a while in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he does a lot of breeding and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we worked together and on that just to,
it was my first time just to walk me
[SPEAKER_01]: through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used a cordial silver and we got
Paul off the pace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, I actually bought it a 15 pack
from them and he, he, he seeded them all
[SPEAKER_01]: out and he got me some pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, uh, we did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We let it, the Yoda grow out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hit it with pollen, uh, just with a
little Q-tip or a brush, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, we, we didn't get a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did not want to take, cause this,
the master Yoda is an F6.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting it to flip was not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only got about 30 seeds and,
but they were good, solid, mature seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I've, you, I've tried one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I threw one out back this year just to see
what it would do just to, I don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: care if I got anything off and I didn't
want to see its structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still standing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the middle of November.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally leading with button rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is standing there leaning over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like six feet tall and it still
hasn't finished flowering yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was been out there since June.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, well, it looks like I'm going
to have to absolutely hit this with a fast
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause right now it's like a, it's an FF
basically like the fast flowering of
[SPEAKER_01]: photos you would get from, from,
uh, 42 fast, but for 20 fast buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's basically that right now it's 50%
photo, 25% auto.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I would add another 25 in from
another, from another, or I can self it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but self and it's not going to get me to
an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might, a couple of the phenols might
end up showing auto flower expressions,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, and then I'm just learning this
stuff now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's going to be a long
project, but once I get to the point where
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually can figure it out and I'll
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work hard for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll, I'll tackle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now I'm concentrating on
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I'm done with that, this year's
Christmas present is going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: propagation tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put it in my bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's three floors away from the
basement and stop breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding autos is really a whole topic in
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we won't dive too deep into that one,
but I was interested to just hear about
[SPEAKER_00]: your progress on your personal project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I get good at it, I know what I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make the OG one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, kind of going back to feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one thing that we kind of missed
was pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you monitor the pH at all and adjust
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, what do you aim for?
[SPEAKER_01]: So where this is a form of hydroponic
growing, cause it is, it's basically poor
[SPEAKER_01]: man's hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stay between five seven and five nine,
five eight is where I want to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: but five seven is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five nine is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll adjust up and down as I go and I
adjust the entire, uh, reservoir at a
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't just take the nutrients out and
adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I forgot to tell you, I should have
told you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use recharge every time too,
just a half a gram of, uh, I measure,
[SPEAKER_01]: I weighed out on a scale, you know,
and a half a gram gram goes in every mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also do the same thing with stash
blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot to say that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running stash blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the half teaspoon per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm doing 10 spoons full basically in
the 20 gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find it, it's doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had any issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It falls up a little bit sometimes,
but I put it in the mixer and that's done
[SPEAKER_01]: in two seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen your Instagram pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those that are on Instagram,
definitely follow Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a link to his Instagram down in
the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the stash blend pictures there and I
was like, Oh, that's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, it's really cool hearing you that
you're having so much success with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that is a formula that myself,
Rob Pigeons, George Murray, need over
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all formulate sat down and
brainstormed and figure out how we can
[SPEAKER_00]: formulate that particular blend and a good
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it has a lot of good things in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everything that it needs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an additive, but it's, it's got some
really good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I've seen a lot of great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to see that you're having some
good success with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of questions people always had is,
well, can you run it with recharge?
[SPEAKER_01]: I run it with recharge all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: None at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they seem to actually, bump EC up
right so I can get to where I want to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit, you know, it'd be a little bit
low to eight to nine, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed when I mixed that in there
and all that, I hit it right at three and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, anything that I can give the plant
that the plant's going to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and not show me bad expressions I'm going
to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy, easy peasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into genetics a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you named off quite a bit of
genetics that you've grown before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had good success with,
but if you had to step back and think
[SPEAKER_00]: about everything you've grown,
what are the top three auto flower strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that in your ranking are the top three?
[SPEAKER_01]: Master Yoda from, uh, Mendel Brothers
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a 2021 auto flower cup winner,
uh, for them, uh, stable, uh, heavy feeder
[SPEAKER_01]: grows great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the right amount of really good
structure, just the right amount of leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: to bud, um, great smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really well done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Triscuit, which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a freebie from a North Atlanta seed
company before I started going direct to
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's from Mendocino 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do a good job with auto flowers
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just threw it in there and it just
did not stop growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was growing and growing and
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I super cropped it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I did, it created a branch about
this long with four footballs on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all bigger than my forearm and
I'm a 250, 60 pound guy and it was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it came out and it was tasted in the,
it was just a fantastic run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love, I would redo that again in a
heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my favorite strain, um, that I've
grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I used, I used to get from my
caretaker back in the day before I grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my heart, it's a, it's something I'll
always grow here and there when I can find
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jack the Ripper, it's created by
Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just, it's in my opinion,
it's one of the most steady, you don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: too tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get too, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it grew, I grew it at a photo and as
an auto to test them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the auto was, it just blew the photo
out of the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew the photo outside in 30 gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was beautiful, but the photo just had
so much because it was grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has so much herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so much stickiness and it was
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those would be the three favorite I've
grown so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I can tell you that, uh,
now that I'm running speed run seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're all, they're all created
strains like you did with Tlg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so you're not going to get like sour
diesel or any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the mainstream white label,
none of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all like his, I'm running granted
Hayes right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a F six and it was the first plant
that they started to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now he started working a little bit with,
uh, a bunch of guys in, in, in the
[SPEAKER_01]: triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he built his own auto flower
business and these young guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: thirties or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, his stuff it's taken off
like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it just, he just started to deal
with ILGM.
[SPEAKER_01]: He put three strains in there for October
and they late, they named them,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, October's like reader of the month or
whatever sold out in three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have, he sends me a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably have almost all of his genetics
here right now to grow when I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with Mendel brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matter of fact, I actually restarted all
the part of us to see if I could give him
[SPEAKER_01]: his cause they were sent to me to send to
him to see if he wouldn't do the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To grow together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, he's like, I have so many seeds,
Dave, just give them to somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this could change because I'm about to
run, when this is done, I'm about to run
[SPEAKER_01]: the ice cream paint job, which is a brand
new photo of auto from Mendel brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's made with the original chem and
a few other inputs with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the runs that they've been
done testing have been incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like higher than 30% TC was nobody gives a
shit about that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it's all about flavonoids and
stuff, but, uh, from what I understand,
[SPEAKER_01]: insane gas and insane taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be right up Rob's alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met a guy who's grow sure banger and
grows headbanger all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Malik from, uh, from, uh, professional
joint rollers, but I'm, I'm branching out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm, I just know that those two,
those two companies have never stared me
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their stuff has always popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always been stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to check out speed run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never grown them before, although I
feel just like Lynn, where I have so many
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics more than I can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, he told me he had like 90,
uh, night policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a run still.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you mentioning the auto
flower strains, the top ones that you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like you've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we do have plenty of people here
that are shopping for genetics and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, hearing other people's experience
with it and suggestions on what to grow is
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we do have a lot of beginner growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tune into the pub, this podcast as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one question I like to ask what advice
you have for beginners that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: getting started growing auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just getting started and you're
going to do autos dot in soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: learn how to grow, learn the plant,
learn the structure, learn what you can
[SPEAKER_01]: feed it in soil, how to water it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every, I believe that every person that
grows should learn how to hand water
[SPEAKER_01]: first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause once you master hand watering,
the rest is easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can overwater or underwater of any
kind of plant very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're going to start with auto
parts, that's a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would use cocoa and, uh, just to make
sure it's got a little fluff to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the best advice I can give to
anybody that's going to grow an auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flower is make sure whatever your medium
is, it is fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using cocoa or soil,
because the more barrier or the more
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance you put up to those small
roots, the smaller the roots are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be, and they're not going to travel as
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fluffier and the more you can give
them a pathway that's easy, they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to shoot down really fast and you're going
to get really good vigor in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would definitely start with a medium
like that and just put it in a three
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon or a five gallon or a seven gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always grew autos in a seven gallon,
um, and went indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and just make sure you water
correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of meters out there you can
get now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to check where your water and you
can use the ultrasonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's riding through and pick up the pot,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but you really want to learn to hand
water and care for your plant as
[SPEAKER_01]: organically as you can in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then when you get through that a
few times where then you can stop playing
[SPEAKER_01]: like I didn't learn your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a lot of the auto flower
growers that I interviewed for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, a lot of them emphasize what you
emphasize, which was the aeration in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium and how important it is and how it
really, really impacts growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have that aeration and a lot of
people prefer more area mediums like
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa, for example, cause they can get
that growth and then adding in that air
[SPEAKER_00]: pump down below into the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps the growth even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm seeing a trend here of the
auto flower growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going after those area mediums
that can, uh, they'd get oxygen down in
[SPEAKER_01]: the root zone, which is huge for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, then you look at auto pos,
they have the little oxygen thing down the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom now and all that oxygen is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I oxygenate my food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I have a little, uh,
fungus nap.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had bugs with Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the reasons why I went that
route.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I have an embasement and now I got
some fungus now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just had to get some, uh,
mosquito bits in and they'll take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a few, but I hate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's, what's pigeons do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I battled them so many times, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're such a pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in soil and, uh, it seems to get a
little bit more, but I have had in cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a really bad infestation in cocoa
and a lot of people say, Oh, you can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: him in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has definitely a misconception.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can totally get fungus gnats within
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just thrive on that wet medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can with Rockwell now too,
cause they like the algae.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how you get a little algae on the
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the floor flex covers on the top
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that there's none of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't get on my hands, but the little
area that's open between the six inch and
[SPEAKER_01]: the eight inch when you stack it gets
algae and they can eat, they can feed off
[SPEAKER_01]: the algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this has been a fantastic talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running through everything in your grow
your grow style.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely have some unique points
here when it comes to growing autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you revealing your secrets
to us here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell listeners how they can find
you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, mostly on IG right now under,
uh, uh, the mad scientist, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually doing a seat to have a weekly
vlog on there right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, uh, the, anybody wants to reach
out and DM me, uh, if you want a speed run
[SPEAKER_01]: code to get you a discount, I can get you
a speed run code for a discount on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, if you want to try this stuff to,
uh, grow some autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also on Facebook under the same demand
scientists just started it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there will be some, uh, more podcasts
in the future, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there will be, uh, some breeding
projects in the future, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot more growing big, huge autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some exciting stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to Dave's
Instagram down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below so you can easily get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening on one of the podcast
platforms, just search for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find them.
