[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode number 150.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview George
Murray.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to college at Purdue, where he
studied plant physiology and plant
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolomics, and he now works in the
fertilizer industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the formulation chemist for both
Ventana plant science and stash blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, he talks about several
organic inputs, their benefits,
[SPEAKER_01]: sourcing, bacteria, fungi, and more.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back and I'm joined with George
Murray.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about a whole bunch of
different things today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You formulated plant science, that whole
nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You formulated Stash Blend, which my
audience is very familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to get into those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get too deep into things,
could you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was kind of one piece at a
time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you grow up and, you know,
I did a lot of you pick fruit picking with
[SPEAKER_00]: my mother and that would go into kind of
making jams and pies and other types of
[SPEAKER_00]: baked goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just kind of had this,
I had this fascination, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: with this connection of, you know,
being able to see something from start to
[SPEAKER_00]: finish and growing something and then
making that into a product and then
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing that, you know, throughout the
seasons and all the emotions that went
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I got older, I got to be a lot more
curious about the science side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went away to Purdue and studied a lot
of plant physiology, plant metabolomics,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I got into the
agrochemical industry and the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and really continue to do more
research and figure out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how can we effectuate changes in crop
physiology and maximize our yields and
[SPEAKER_00]: just it kind of like all the emotions and
everything kind of came together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my scientific interests overlapped and
here we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a journey, let's put it that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when did you kind of link up and
get Ventana Plant Science going?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a few seasons back now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oddly enough, it's funny how time works,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Time flies and you're having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a few years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Nate was an introduction, Nate Lipton,
who heads up Ventana.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an introduction and mutual friend
and we just hit it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Nate's moving a shaker,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was excited about innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was just this kind of meeting
connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of sat down at the table and said,
hey, you know, with everything that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and all the people that you know,
everything that I know, I think there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some creative work that can get done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just been it's been a blast
working with him and his team,
[SPEAKER_00]: innovating and putting stuff out like
Stash, you know, obviously a great example
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Stash Blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking back that you formulated
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two and a half years ago now, if I
remember correctly, and then obviously we
[SPEAKER_01]: did a year of testing before even
releasing and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, man, time does fly for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gray hair and the beard is no longer
accidental.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wake up one day and I'm like,
am I an old man yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, how much longer I got to go
because I feel like it, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting into I want to get into Stash
Blend first a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know some people might be like,
oh, well, this is just going to be an
[SPEAKER_01]: infomercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: For Stash Blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be more to it than just
Stash Blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to dive into some of these
ingredients because we get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: questions, some really good questions from
folks that are using Stash Blend or
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in using Stash Blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the main questions that we get
is about one of the ingredients,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is Coins Deep Liquor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us all about Coins Deep
Liquor, everything from what it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: its benefits, how it's sourced,
so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Coins Deep Liquor is a byproduct of
what we call wet corn milling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you take the corn, typically
there's something you want to produce from
[SPEAKER_00]: that corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot here in the US, we produce a lot
of ethanol from corn that goes into fuels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also produce a lot of starches,
which will go down and create modified
[SPEAKER_00]: starches and a lot of things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also produce a lot of high-proteose
corn syrup from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the byproduct from that process is
Coins Deep Liquor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go through and you go through
that wet milling process, all the amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acids, all the proteins, all the vitamins,
all the minerals, aka not the starches,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the sugars, that all used to get just
pitched down the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a waste product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then someone at some point in time
said, now, hold on a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all these great proteins,
peptides, amino acids, all these great
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamins and minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something we should be able to do
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't take the plant community
long to figure out that it was really an
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent source of nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for me, when you look at the
way Coins Deep Liquor is used right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's used as a food source for a lot of
fermentation, large-scale fermentation
[SPEAKER_00]: work that goes on because it's such an
excellent fermentation product for biology
[SPEAKER_00]: too, and food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you look at a lot of the other
ingredients in stash and you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: overlaps and the synergies that we're
creating, Coins Deep Liquor as a
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation was a really great fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an up-cycle product that would have
gone into a waste stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that checks the box or environmental
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great nutritional, mineral, amino acid,
protein profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's a little sticky to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some things we spray dry it
into a powder and things along those
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really the foundation of stash
and why it's a foundation of stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great foundational product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's listed as one of the top
ingredients for it and contributes to the
[SPEAKER_01]: NPK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the questions that people have
asked about the Coins Deep Liquor is,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you happen to know if the corn was
GMO or non-GMO?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't matter at that point in
time because you're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: extracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the proteins that come out of that
are really not going to make a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do use an organic Coins Deep Liquor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be non-GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot of where the Coins Deep
Liquor ends up is more inorganic
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the niche that it fills.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a non-organic, I suppose,
GMO, Coins Deep Liquor, but the iteration
[SPEAKER_00]: that we use is organic compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talking about organic compliance,
I think it's appropriate to talk a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit about OMRI certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we did touch upon this in a
conversation from the stash, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it warrants on here as well, since there's
a bit of a different audience on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But OMRI certification, we get this
question a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, why isn't Stash Blend OMRI
certified?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a conversation that we had
behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you probably remember this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of generally advised not
to go the OMRI certification route.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just break it down for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: OMRI certification, what is it and what
are the pros and cons of being OMRI
[SPEAKER_01]: certified?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think any certification,
any third party certification that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, it helps market the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's something that people can
recognize.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are theoretically other organic
certifying agencies that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: California's got theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington's got theirs, as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you don't go the route of
OMRI doesn't mean you couldn't do an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic certification to another organic
certifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But OMRI charges per size, it's few.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, last I checked anyway,
it's been a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we wanted to sell it, one pound bag
and a half pound bag or 50 gram bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd have to pay different prices for each
one of those skews.
[SPEAKER_00]: OMRI is the Organic Materials Review
Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's valuable in my estimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's run by people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a perfect organization by any
stretch of imagination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say philosophically, some of the
stuff that's on there from an OMRI
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective can be a head scratcher for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the stuff that's not on there
can be a head scratcher for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for instance, the polyaspartic
acid that we have in there, which I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll talk about here in a bit,
that's from sugars that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented into fermeric acid and then
aspartic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use heat to polymerize the
aspartic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And OMRI says, well, since you're using
heat to do that, it's not organic anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just their philosophies,
their take on things versus ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some ingredients in there that
OMRI says they don't want to certify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we want to have the best products
possible out to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the route that we went.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think also the fees were a big
turnoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the amount of money that you got
to pay just to get the OMRI certification
[SPEAKER_01]: is pretty extensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you get out of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to use the logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are going to care about it,
but I think a lot of consumers these days,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't really care as much about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we chose not to go the OMRI
certification route for those reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we want to do right by the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to do right by our customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it just fits to where, hey,
we can also get a third party
[SPEAKER_00]: certification that people see and
understand and recognize and appreciate,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we have the right ingredients in
there and they've got the right pedigree
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're doing the right thing for the
plants and the right thing for the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the most important piece of the
puzzle to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I think we were all
aligned.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we sat down and we had these meetings
on it, we were just, we were completely
[SPEAKER_01]: all on the same page on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to do what's best for the
environment and best for the customer as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having this all in one blend was a huge
win for the customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just less bottles they have to,
there are less individual bottles that
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to buy as additives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having it all in one blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really, really been good on that
avenue as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seaweed extract, I'd like to get into that
next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is a pretty common input.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people use seaweed, but break it
down for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is seaweed extract?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the benefits?
[SPEAKER_01]: How was it sourced?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on and so forth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seaweed grows all the way around the
world, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you have to answer is
what kind of seaweed you play with,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are some species of seaweed
that spend their entire life in water,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of the California as an example,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, what we're interested in is
those, you know, intertidal zone species,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ascophyllanidosum is probably the most
obvious example one, and that's the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is that those seaweeds,
you know, end up spending half their life
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of water as the water recedes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, you've created an
incredibly stressful environment for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the plant's producing all
these secondary metabolites to survive in
[SPEAKER_00]: those conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's those secondary metabolites from
seaweed that we really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can take and harbor set seaweed,
which is absolutely sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seaweed that we actually get is from
the coast of Ireland, completely
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainably harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can take that seaweed and you can
mill it, wet mill it into a seaweed
[SPEAKER_00]: dispersion, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get all the cell walls and all the
pridus and all the lignin and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemicellulose and everything that's
insoluble in that product along with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we've taken to do is we take that
and we mill the seaweed and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: extract that with potassium hydroxide to
create a soluble extraction of all those
[SPEAKER_00]: little goodies that we like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it cuts out all the lignin and the
hemicellulose and all the cell wall stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that you don't need, and that's not
soluble in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, it increases your concentration
of all those beautiful secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolizers, plant defense mechanisms,
compounds and the rooting hormones and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's along those lines that are in
seaweeds that we like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the route that we went.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ask a foundosome, harvest it off
Ireland, extract the potassium hydroxide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that gives you the cleanest product
with the highest concentration of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: goodies that we like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to ask you about the
potassium hydroxide next, because that is
[SPEAKER_01]: listed on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember in a past conversation,
you mentioned it's not really in there
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore, but you have to put it on there
from a regulatory standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fertilizer laws require you to put that on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you did, correct me if I'm wrong,
you mentioned that some potassium is
[SPEAKER_01]: available on there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a reaction that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you get into that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium hydroxide is KOH, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your potassium ion,
you have your hydroxide ion, and potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: is positive, your hydroxide is negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is that when you react
that with usually the lower pH secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: plant metabolites, the potassium remains
and the hydroxide ions actually react with
[SPEAKER_00]: the hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And come off the other compounds,
creating water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you end up with potassium salts of all
the other goodies that you like in water
[SPEAKER_00]: as your reaction product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no potassium hydroxide that
actually remains as potassium hydroxide
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you end up water and potassium and all
your secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the labeling laws under APCO and state
by state require that if you use a
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium, if you use a seaweed extract,
the product, you have to list the
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium hydroxide in there with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of goofy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think that's probably another
thing that you look at with the labeling
[SPEAKER_00]: laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they always come from a point
of good intentions, but I think sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually create a lot more confusion
than they actually resolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the end of another podcast
conversation for another day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm sure we could get into super
deep about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we'll avoid that conversation
for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I did want to mention that when
we talk about labeling, there is something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is in stash blend that's not on the
label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the amino acid polymer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I forget the reason why you mentioned
why it can't be on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can expand on that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about amino acid
polymers just in general, everything about
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a number of different amino
acid polymers that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, amino acids go together to
create peptides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from peptides, they'll grow into
proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we try to do, though,
with our amino acid polymers, we take a
[SPEAKER_00]: singular amino acid, which is aspartic
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we take that aspartic acid and we
use exceptionally high heat around 500
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we fuse those aspartic acid monomers
together to form an aspartic acid polymer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, we'll react it with
potassium hydroxide, where we heard this
[SPEAKER_00]: before, to make it a soluble polymer
instead of an insoluble polymer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the story behind how this concept came
about actually originates from the late
[SPEAKER_00]: 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had discovered that mollusks in the
ocean build their shells out by taking
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium from the water by using an
aspartic acid polymer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of our polymers out there have a
synthetic man-made polymers that we use,
[SPEAKER_00]: like polyacrylates and things along those
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not biodegradable, so they don't
break down in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so someone said, hey, look,
we've got mollusks that are creating this
[SPEAKER_00]: amino acid polymer to grab on the
nutrients to help build out their shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't this work in agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, how could we diagram a way to
produce this in mass and predictably,
[SPEAKER_00]: and get this out in agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can use this to grab nutrients
out of the soil and increase nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, by the way, the process to make
it, your byproduct is water vapor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and your polymer is fully biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, the polymer that we make is
food grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually is probably another
conversation another day, but it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: goes into beverages all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain very specific beverages,
but again, it's another story for another
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, there's labeling laws,
and there's requirements, there's all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to have the best possible
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to have something that was going
to increase nutritional uptake in plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really the whole secret story
behind Bash Blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that with biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing that with seaweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing that with cornsteak liquors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's being the biology in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this beautiful aspartic
acid polymer that's in that mix that's
[SPEAKER_00]: chemically helping grab onto the nutrients
and also acting as a terrific food source
[SPEAKER_00]: with the bacteria and biology on the back
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not on the label because again,
labeling requirements and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got decades of research on this
stuff, but it never seems to be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact right format that each state wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states have no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states, and predictably, you're going
to know probably which states those are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they just like putting their oars
in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a little bit behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of go back to that labeling law
stuff and then intensely good,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it actually ends up harming consumers
in some ways because we're not able to put
[SPEAKER_00]: everything we want to put on there,
but we want to build out the best products
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you expanding on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to get into humic acid next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about what is humic
acid?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the benefits?
[SPEAKER_01]: Reasoning why it was added into stash
blend and all that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, humic acid has had a big following
for a long time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's some serious synergies
when you add humics in with seaweeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: with our polyamino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done other types of work and
released other products with that same
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And humic acid is that if you look at its
age, it was usually produced in the
[SPEAKER_00]: carboniferous era, millions and millions
of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had we left it in the ground, it would
have eventually turned into coal,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it hadn't gotten there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was produced in a time period in
our earth where the carbon dioxide content
[SPEAKER_00]: was exceptionally high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a lot of carbon and you've got
a lot of really great complex carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: sources that are part of humic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mine the human, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to take the soluble
low-molecular fraction off that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will come off in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's left is that higher
molecular weight organic or carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: containing compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times you'll, again,
you'll hear this again, you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium hydroxide to create soluble
compounds from that mass, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the humic acid we use is actually
mined down in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's produced here in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really clean, really beautiful
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing I like about humic acid is
again, it's a very complex high molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: weight source of organic carbon,
which is really great for biology because
[SPEAKER_00]: the more complex you get in your organic
matter, the more difficult it is for the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology that we don't want to feed to use
it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the harmful pathogenic biology
that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a great food source there,
very complex, but we've also got a really
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of interesting secondary metabolite
compounds that come in the bad humic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's hard for people to put
their fingers on exactly what those
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't you run through like high pressure
liquid chromatography and or mass
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrometry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start to kind of take apart,
you know, exactly what's in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are kind of unidentifiable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens and what usually happens
is that good food source of bacteria and
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also there's some nice secondary
metabolites that it sounds wild to say
[SPEAKER_00]: this, but has survived for millions of
years chemically intact and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: response on plant growth as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, humic acid was something that I
didn't really even think of to potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: add to stash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that's something you you want
to put in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was a fantastic idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it definitely works well in that
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into silica next on the
label.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have soluble silicon silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a highly purified silicon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: In there, some parts are soluble,
some parts are insoluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But break it down for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the details on silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a double duty mix,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it there functionally for the
blend itself because there's a lot of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we call hygroscopic elements in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hygroscopic elements mean elements
that want compounds that want to pull in
[SPEAKER_00]: water, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So orange seed liquor is really
hygroscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The polyaspartate polymer is really
hygroscopic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the silica will actually do a
really great job of holding water as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to try to kind of
mitigate some of the clumping issues that
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers would have as much as we could
is really sensitive compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not going to eliminate everything,
but we wanted to include silica in there
[SPEAKER_00]: as a mechanism that would help absorb
water a lot like you would find in silica
[SPEAKER_00]: packets, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And foodstuffs or things like that,
where you're trying to absorb the water
[SPEAKER_00]: and prevent your food from spoiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, we said, look,
this is going to work from a functional
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective for the product that's kind of
an anti-clumping aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can this also be a silica source for
plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, plants, you know,
you look at calcium deposition and
[SPEAKER_00]: building walls and obviously it cross
links with boron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so you can't have calcium
deposition if you don't have boron.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, silica actually plays a
really, really big part in building out
[SPEAKER_00]: the scaffolding of cells as well,
more of an exterior rather than an
[SPEAKER_00]: interior component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I read an article the other day where
they were actually considering making
[SPEAKER_00]: silica an essential nutrient, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, hey, you need silica,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I thought was really interesting
because there's always this debate,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you need silica?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you not need silica?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, you know, having silica is
always, always going to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, there's a lot of silica out
there in the world, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what it comes down to is
available silica, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why when you put it on the
label, you can only put in what the acid
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble silica fraction is because that's
what's available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we really wanted to put in a
bunch of silica, we could have put in
[SPEAKER_00]: sand, which is silicon dioxide,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we all know sand's not available to
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at the particle size,
you look at how that's going to break
[SPEAKER_00]: down, how it's going to react.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we start with a
nanoparticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silica dioxide has been built down to
exceptionally small, let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: nanoparticle at about nanometers,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exceptionally small size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that makes it a lot easier to react
with the biology, react with the water
[SPEAKER_00]: sources and create that acid soluble
silica that's then available to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually in a form of
monosilicic acid or orthosilicic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's double duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got kind of an anti-clumping aid
that's in the product, but you've also got
[SPEAKER_00]: the right form of silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the right size that's going to
be readily available to the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a pretty cool thing we built
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant will release acids, microbes
will release acids that produce hydrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: ions that are going to react and turn it
into the monosilicic and orthosilicic
[SPEAKER_01]: acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got a really small nanoparticle,
silicon dioxide, you hook a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogens up to that and introduce some
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bob's your uncle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pH is totally impacted in the
medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to kind of derail a little
bit and talk about pH in the medium,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think a lot of folks are
confused about pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think like, okay, the water source
that they mix in or the nutrients that
[SPEAKER_01]: they mix up and adjust the pH on,
when they water it in, they're expecting
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's what it is in the medium as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got a pH in the medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you also look at the rhizosphere
where it could be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plant releases acids and microbes
release acids that change the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you expand on that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, pH is just that
concentration between hydrogen ions,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are acidic, and hydroxide ions,
which are basic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you've got inputs like your water
source, you've got inputs like your
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer sources, and that are
absolutely going to play a bit of a role
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to the pH of the soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, you have that balance of
minerals that are in the soil that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the ultimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cater there and they go a step beyond
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what happens is that it's really
the plant that's able to kind of help
[SPEAKER_00]: modify and it's rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some plants are a lot better at this
than other plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on genetics, where they've
grown up naturally, what kind of genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: they're carrying, if they've had to modify
their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of tropical plants grow in very
acidic soils, they're very old soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: very weathered soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, those plants are adept
at releasing hydroxide ions and do the
[SPEAKER_00]: buffer their pH up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have other plants that,
you know, can grow in more alkaline
[SPEAKER_00]: environments, knowing that the soil needs
to be a little more acidic for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: take up essential micronutrients like iron
or manganese or zinc, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're a lot better at releasing
hydroxide ions, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to acidify that rhizosphere
and acidify that soil surface at the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: and the bulk media.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, really, you know,
a lot of what happens in this exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: between the roots and the soil is that
when a plant takes up, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: a positively charged nutrient like
ammonium, as an example, it will release
[SPEAKER_00]: the hydrogen to balance that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because otherwise it'd be acidifying
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why something like ammonium
sulfate as a nitrogen source will reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH in your soil.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people use elemental
sulfur to drop pH in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens there is actually a chemical
reaction between the elemental sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: turning into sulfuric acid from a
biological reaction, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some kind of examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we did with the stash blend,
it's a very neutral blend, very low use
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're not going to see a lot of
pH differences when you use this product,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a very neutral product,
both in terms of its pH of itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also in how it works with the plant
and taking up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there to assist the plant to take up
nutrients in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to move the pH of the soil by
adding in things like calcium carbonate
[SPEAKER_00]: involved, or ammonium sulfate or elemental
sulfur involved, depending on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what you're growing and what you
want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I hear a lot of organic growers
that often say they don't pH their soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're like, oh, yeah, the biology in
the medium is going to take care of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You explained in detail how that can
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plus the plant's releasing acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really good info there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have a lot of knowledge on
bacteria as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bacteria, there's a consortium of
bacteria in a stash blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bacillus lichenformis,
bacillus petarelli, bacillus subtilis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then a panbacillus azofixens,
which I probably butchered all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: names, but I came close, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Break it down for us all about bacteria,
you know, what those particular species do
[SPEAKER_01]: for plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think when you look at that mix,
right, and simple Google searches will
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you, you know, specifically what each
one of those do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in fairness of time,
without going too far down a rabbit hole,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'll address, you know,
each one of them in its particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have that genus and species that
identifies what you have, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not quite that simple because
then you have different strains of those
[SPEAKER_00]: genus and species, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so each different strain of a
bacillus, a subtilis example, is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work a little bit differently from one
strain to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've identified over a course
of time and do a fermentative process is a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain of select individuals that will do
primarily two things is what we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is just overall plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And guarding that rise of the sphere and
giving those molecular signals to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and out-competing the pathogenic
bacteria that might be in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other is nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually what we're looking at there is
just kind of overall from an enzymatic
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, but also in particular from a
nitrogen uptake perspective as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if you look at the stash
plant, I know we've talked about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, individual ingredients,
right, and kind of on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every one of the ingredients on
their own has real merit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to absolutely help you
when you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in the format that we have
them, the specific species that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: built out in our biology, the amino acid
polymer, the key mix of seaweeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: the food source in the form of corn steep
liquor, that synergy of ingredients that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've tied in, you know, across multiple
continents of raw materials and brought
[SPEAKER_00]: into one bag, you know, I think that's
where that's the special performance
[SPEAKER_00]: really comes into when you use those
things in synergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the biology is, you know,
obviously a big part of that, that it is
[SPEAKER_00]: lyophilized, freeze-dried onto a
sugar-based substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it gets into water, the signal to
the biology is, hey, we've got water
[SPEAKER_00]: again, let's rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason we use a sugar-based
substrate is so that there's a humectancy
[SPEAKER_00]: with those sugars, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cells don't dry out when you're
going through that lyophilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lyophilization is freeze-dried,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can spray dry with heat,
or you can freeze dry using cold
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point in time, it's more kind
of an evaporation, sublimation,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you go from a freezing to a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a lot more gentle when it comes
to the survival of the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And using those humectants, those
osmolites, are how we preserve the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the species that intrigues me the
most is the Pambacillus azosifixiens,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's nitrogen-fixing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blows my mind that they're able to grab
nitrogen from the air and convert it into
[SPEAKER_01]: a form that the plant can uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is really neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more of that coming,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think even in row crop,
if you look at some of the companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: are out there, some of the startup
companies, there's gaining traction where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're putting these specific species and
strains of biology down to help bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know predictably that you can
reduce your synthetic nitrogen inputs by X
[SPEAKER_00]: number of pounds per acre when they do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need more of that, by the way,
because there's an incredible amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions that are off-put during that
manufacturing of fertilizer, as you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the industry is not resting on its
laurels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people are actively trying to
figure out a Haber-Bosch process where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can fix nitrogen from the air using
sustainable electricity and with reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: pressures and reduced heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not there yet, obviously,
but that's a process that's 100 years old,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it needs some updating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But attacking it from the biological side,
to me, yes, please, let's see more of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if it can be sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not cause harm to the environment,
that would be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now next to really on any micro product,
you should see a CFU slash G, which stands
[SPEAKER_01]: for colony forming units per gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you kind of talk to us a little bit
about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what does that actually mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some reasonable amounts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, reasonable amounts are going
to be, you know, depending on use rates,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, and depending on
the species themselves, how well do they
[SPEAKER_00]: colonize?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how are they going to come out,
compete other organisms?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the colony forming units per
gram is just a way to recognize what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: density of viable living organisms,
if you put it in one gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a way to measure how many viable
living organisms you actually have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's third party certified,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've got to send out the third
party lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to grow the species on the
petri dish and be able to measure that for
[SPEAKER_00]: us and give us a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us to be able to put that on the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also why the bag has an
expiration date, even though since it's
[SPEAKER_00]: completely dry, you know, the expiration
date is kind of something that's legally
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to put on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, you know, it's not something
that I think goes bad in the expiration
[SPEAKER_00]: date.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's just a way to be able to
express at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many living viable units you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you'll see 10 to 6, 10 to 7,
10 to 8, that's a million.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 2 million, 100 million,
a billion, you know, when you get a 10 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 9, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, anything around those numbers,
10 to 5 even, depending on the species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you get into really low counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you wonder sometimes if there's
more, you know, sizzle than steak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think to me, it's just trusting what
you see with a plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use a biological
product, you know, what do you see from
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you putting it in, you know,
in a media that is fairly sterile?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because you're going to see
probably different things from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you putting it out there in a
composted outdoor environment that's
[SPEAKER_00]: aiming with biology, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some, you know,
are you going into a situation where there
[SPEAKER_00]: was steam sterilization in the soil and
you're rebuilding?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let your eye and let your yield
indicators tell you whether a biological
[SPEAKER_00]: product or biologically based product or
probably contains biology is doing what
[SPEAKER_00]: you want it to do rather than how many
colony forming units is printed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see next to the bacteria,
it's called colony forming units,
[SPEAKER_01]: but next to the endomycorrhizae,
it's prop slash G.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just proper goals, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just another way to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're dealing with a different organism,
obviously, you know, when you go from
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria to fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's how those are measured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, mycorrhizae are difficult
because I don't think there is as much
[SPEAKER_00]: consensus out there in the laboratory
methods to measure those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're a lot harder to measure at
the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for me, it's about taking
reputable partners when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae and.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but that's that's the same sort
of analogous to CFUs is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much how much can you can you
propagate and from that from that input
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so endomycorrhizae, that's in stash
bland.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's four different species of Glomus
in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't try to butcher the four different
ones there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, entoradesis is the most important
one, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you look at endomycorrhizae and
what and what it does, the vast majority
[SPEAKER_00]: of research that that you'll find out
there is on entoradesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a heavy lifter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the endo package that we use was was
specifically built out to be water
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble, to be able to run through
irrigation, to be used in large scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, greenhouse grows as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of all the mycorrhizal packages out
there, mycorrhizal suppliers we could work
[SPEAKER_00]: with that that to me was and it was fairly
new iteration to a fairly new new launch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we built that one into
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mycorrhizal fungi has so many
benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just give us a quick rundown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think, you know, I think it's one
of the more classic examples of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, an excellent symbiotic
relationship where you have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the endomycorrhizae, they're actually
moving into the vascular system of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and extending out a typhi into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're magnifying, the plant's going
to give up a little energy to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a trade off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're doing, you're magnifying
the root system of the plant, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants, you're your nutrient uptake
is to find root hairs, not your structural
[SPEAKER_00]: larger roots that have been magnified.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the root hairs that do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those root hairs will slough off
and die and continue to reproduce and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have the plant taking nutrients
to its root hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you have also these mycorrhizae,
these endomycorrhizae that are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: into the vascular system of the plant and
tying in directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're growing out their hyphae and
so in parallel, there's root hair uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have the ability to take up
nutrients through the mycorrhizae as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great, great symbiotic
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know you hear a lot of it with
phosphorus, how it really helps like
[SPEAKER_01]: unlock phosphorus, make it more available
and be able to transport it and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you hear that because phosphorus
is really mobile in the soil, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about root interception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're able to expand,
you know, your either real root system or
[SPEAKER_00]: your borrowed root system from the
mycorrhizae, your odds of stumbling across
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients improves greatly, you know,
at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you build in your polyasprotate
in there, which helps with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You build in your bacteria in the
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about it, it's more of a
longer term play, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The bacteria can move into soil and can
start working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other elements that we have in the
stash plant can move into soil and start
[SPEAKER_00]: working right away, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the mycorrhizae, you know,
they've got to infiltrate into the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've got to grow out their root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's more of a longer term play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you're having this turnover,
all your wonderful, you know, biological
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds and bacteria that's in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, at this point,
George's connection dropped being on the
[SPEAKER_01]: road.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just me here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to close out this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, big thanks to George for
coming on to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned in the beginning of the
episode, George is the formulation chemist
[SPEAKER_01]: for both Ventana plant science and stash
blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have links to those products down in
the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also link the from the stash episode
that we did with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, awesome episode there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend all of you go to that episode
after this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as social media, George isn't
really on social media and he likes his
[SPEAKER_01]: personal time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll be no social media links for
him or ways for you to contact him.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you comment down below and mention
part two, if we get enough of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe I can have him come on again in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also listed the questions that you may
have for George down in the comments
[SPEAKER_01]: section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm able to get him back on for
another episode, maybe I'll ask some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also want to give a big thank you to the
Patreon supporters, patreon.com slash Mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow it on the screen right now with the
folks in the producer tier, 100% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: money that is donated through Patreon goes
right back into the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big thank you to the supporters over
there who keep this podcast going.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it for this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for tuning in and I'll
catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out.
