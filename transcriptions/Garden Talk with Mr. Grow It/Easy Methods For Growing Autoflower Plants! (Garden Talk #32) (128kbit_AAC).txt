[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was to tell anybody what tools you
should buy first, number one, obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: you need a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, I would say get a humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool thing with auto flowers is you can
run any light cycle you want to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can run them for six hours a day,
10 hours a day, 20 hours a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put them in your windows still and
still be successful and grow a full
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Track everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's the stupidest thing,
when lights go on, when they go off,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much water you give, when you give it,
because all that is just intel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to help you become a better
gardener at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't, don't transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put them in their final pot,
whether it be a three or five or 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever pot you want to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then auto flower needs to get to where it
needs to get within the first 22 days to
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not where you want them to be
at that point, then chances are you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get much yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grote, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 32.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interviewed Grower Joe
of Basement Auto Flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for five years and
grows peppers, tomatoes, houseplants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and medicinal varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: He specializes in growing auto flower
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're going to get into
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: He tries to keep things simple and he
talks about some of the easy methods that
[SPEAKER_01]: he uses for growing auto flower plants.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with grower Joe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basement Olive Flowers, how you doing
today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing fantastic, Mr. Grow It Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, I appreciate you for having me on,
pal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna talk all about auto flowers
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of your specialty,
huh, auto flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, auto flowers are kind of where I
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing now for about five years
full time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And auto flowers were just kind of where I
felt like it was gonna be made for home
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and have the ability to grow a
bunch of different plants at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll get all into kind of how you grow
your own flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you like to do things in a real
simplistic manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's one thing about your
YouTube channel, which I'll link his
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube channel down in the description
section below, is there's a lot of basic,
[SPEAKER_01]: good, simple information, which helps
beginners, I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your video quality or production is
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really good job on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you only have like, I think coming up
on like six, 600 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we haven't we haven't broke the
thousand yet, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a few more over on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now I'm starting to do it semi
full time so I can stay consistent and put
[SPEAKER_00]: good content out so I can really kind of
build a strong community over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hope that after this video that
you'll exceed a thousand, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get into the nitty gritty of
things talking about auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and kind of how you got into
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening kind of became a passion right
away once once medical plants became
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible in my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing off with auto flowers
because those were kind of the only
[SPEAKER_00]: creators online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started watching Mr. Canuck grow from
seed to stone and guys like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And auto flowers are what they're focusing
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured, you know what, this is
simple enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can start this process, try to dial it
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some big plants, some small
plants, some successful runs and
[SPEAKER_00]: unsuccessful runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's been a it's been a good time,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just excited to start sharing my
information with people because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's lots of creators out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, I try to keep it simple
and I want to make sure that everyone can
[SPEAKER_00]: try to grow plants whichever way they want
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main thing is just get them
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are you exclusively an indoor grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you also grow outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exclusively indoor for the majority of my
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have ran a few runs outdoors with
different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of my success has been in the
basement, basement auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do everything right down here in the
basement from filming to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's typically 100 percent indoor with
a little bit of outdoor here or there if I
[SPEAKER_00]: get the it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I got to ask are you a type of grower
that chases after yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you grow just for variety or what's
your goal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, it was it was yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure that I could get as
much as I could off a plant because I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to try to save money like a lot of
growers out there that are growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially it was yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it kind of came down to variety,
different flavors and things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wanted to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a variety on standby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I had friends and family over that
we kind of try a few different things here
[SPEAKER_00]: or there and get a mix of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, I think it's cool that
when you get different types and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants take off in different ways,
I think that really helps us learn and we
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of dial in our process so we know how
to do with all different types of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and not just the same ones that you're
growing over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bit of both there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mostly now is variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm a variety grower myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like we're in a similar
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually allowed to give a gift in my
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can gift to whoever as long as it's
under an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so friends, family, I do grow a
variety and then I'm able to to give
[SPEAKER_01]: different varieties to others,
which I thought is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to have variety
because I get excited about what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, just like a lot of us growers on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get pumped up when you get
different colors and different flavors and
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to share those with your
friends and family and see them laugh and
[SPEAKER_00]: love it and just be so passionate about it
that they pick up something to start
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's probably the major
thing, the reason why I like it,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what size pots are you growing your
auto flowers in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, I started out with a five
gallon because that's what the guys I
[SPEAKER_00]: followed use in five gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can you can definitely dial it
in with a five gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found I wanted to get more variety and
have more plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I moved it down to a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three gallon I find fills out
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not necessarily getting root
bound, depending on how big of a yield
[SPEAKER_00]: they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a three gallon I run consistently now
across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually my own grow bags that
I run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we won't talk about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll show those later on, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not using the plastic pots,
using the fabric pots, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go with a non-woven, breathable
fabric, three gallon low stress training
[SPEAKER_00]: grow bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go with a gray color instead of a black
that way there you can see your water
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I'm watering, it will actually show
me how much water is in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have less the chance of over watering
and more chance of watering perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get big and beautiful girls in there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some auto flower growers, what they'll do
is they will plant their seed directly
[SPEAKER_01]: into their final container, the container
that the plant is going to be in for its
[SPEAKER_01]: entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other growers, they will start in a solo
cup and then they'll keep on up potting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll keep on transplanting up into
their final container as the plant grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you just plant your seed directly into
that final pot or do you transplant up at
[SPEAKER_01]: all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried a lot of different scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question, do you transplant?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't transplant anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the past I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these plants love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them absolutely hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do it at the right time and you
can time it perfectly, I think you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here, personally, I only had maybe
one or two successful runs doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant situation, starting in a solo
cup, moving it up to a one gallon to a
[SPEAKER_00]: three to a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is back when I was using the five
gallon grow bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I find being a being a seed,
I feel like it's best to touch it as
[SPEAKER_00]: little as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it in its last resting place and
try to get a successful run in that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because realistically, if you're touching
it, you're putting oil on it, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting dirt on it, you're harming it
right off the bat when you put it in its
[SPEAKER_00]: final place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're taking that root system and
you're moving it, which is going to stress
[SPEAKER_00]: it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you only have a certain period of time
for these autoflowers to veg, flower until
[SPEAKER_00]: you're ready to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So realistically, based on my experience,
I would say don't, don't, don't
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put them in their final pot,
whether it be a three, a five,
[SPEAKER_00]: a 10, whatever pot you want to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you have on standby.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't had great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say, no, I do not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's pros and cons to both
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you bring up a great point where
you could come across that stress,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To where you're, you're transplanting,
get that transplant shock as a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're disturbing the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a little bit slow of growth
after you transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some people swear by doing the
transplant specifically to sprinkle some
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal fungi on the root zone,
which is going to be an extension of the
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some people there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also depends on your situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a lack of space, you need to
start in smaller containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that stuff's going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there is all that overall risk,
I think of transplant shock and reducing
[SPEAKER_01]: your overall yield, because any stunt and
growth throughout the life of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: for autoflowers, since they're on that
kind of set time that it's, it grows could
[SPEAKER_01]: negatively impact yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you brought up some great
points on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, I think you need to try each
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're starting, try both to see what
works best for you, because there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: many variables that come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I might do different techniques in my
room than you would do in yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would try everything at least once or
twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that's not just growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let me ask you this with the starting
in this final container, there's that risk
[SPEAKER_01]: of overwatering, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any kind of tips for watering
as the ceiling is just sprouted?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how do you go about watering in a large
pot like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I typically think that an autoflower
needs to get to where it needs to get
[SPEAKER_00]: within the first 22 days to 25 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not where you want them to be
at that point, then chances are you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get much yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, yeah, they'll flower and you'll get
some, you'll get some, some flowers from
[SPEAKER_00]: it and you'll get tasty flowers and you'll
get all kinds of stuff out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, if you don't
get it to that point, it's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be worth your while you're going
to spend a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first 10 days are crucial to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plant my seed directly into its final
container and I dial in my temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be right around 60 percent of 65
percent humidity and I try to keep my
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature around 23 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to transfer that over for you
Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're in those pots and my temps
are dialed in for the whole term,
[SPEAKER_00]: all I do is mist my surface with ph water
and I just want to keep my surface nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not adding any water to the pot at
this point because realistically,
[SPEAKER_00]: the little amount of water is going to
suffocate that root system and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be able to grow as quickly as it
needs to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep the surface nice and moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go in there as many times as you need to
throughout the day and just check if the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface is dry, quick little mist,
just saturate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to soak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to drench it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like almost like a little
dusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was the rain outside and the
concrete goes black, that's kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that I describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first 10 days are crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, you just want to add little
bits of water with a turkey base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just around the stem of the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks awkward, but the stem of the
system and you just want a turkey base
[SPEAKER_00]: around that just a little tiny bit and
make sure you're only doing it every
[SPEAKER_00]: couple days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want over water because it's crucial
to stunt these girls and you're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have success and you're going to get
discouraged in the garden and we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you guys to keep learning and keep
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the main thing and that's how I
get success in the first 22 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some really good tips there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what are you growing in?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your media?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: The medium I use, when I started,
I just want it to be affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be really cheap because I had
to convince a lot of people to let me do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to convince my wife, which is one
person, but they can mask it out to a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to convince her to let me do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cost was the number one problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to make sure I could do it
affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go with Pro Mix DX.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bagged medium that you can buy at
any local grow shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got Michael Reisey in it,
which is great for first time growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about $30 for a bale and it will fill
up about 15 to 20 three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get, number one,
a good medium that is easy to grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, a cheap medium and you're
going to be able to do a lot of plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: a low, low cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's $30 Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably even cheaper down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down in the States, I imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I went with that medium is
because I wanted something that was simple
[SPEAKER_00]: to use and a lot of growers on YouTube are
using it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of just fell into it,
had success with it and I kind of been
[SPEAKER_00]: running it the whole time, but you
probably will see me switch over to Cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: in the near future to give it a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was over at one of my buddy's gardens
and just the feel of it, it just feels so
[SPEAKER_00]: much cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like it's just so much easier to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll probably see me transfer over to
try that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing with the same ProMix VX
for a while now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be nice to get a bit of a
change, I guess, in this garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just taking straight from the
bale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing any additional amending?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some people, they'll add in like a
perlite or some sort of aeration,
[SPEAKER_01]: additional aeration, or instead of doing
additional aeration, what they'll do is
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll add in some additional amendments,
whether it be like organic amendments or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing anything or are you just
taking the bale and putting it right into
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: The bale goes right out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do a Tupperware container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure I'm breaking it
up nice and fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not add anything to the medium
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's store bought and I run it right in my
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we introduce nutrients later on
in the grow cycle, but nothing whatsoever
[SPEAKER_00]: added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just whatever comes with it is what you
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been working pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what are you using for nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nutrient line that I run with,
I've been with a couple, but the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running with right now is called Frunk
Grow Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a new nutrient line on Instagram,
on amazon.com.ca.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're right behind me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what they are is a liquid
nutrient to give you kind of an idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very similar to some of these top
brands like Advanced Nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Canadian made.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're clean product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some salt residue, but I'm not
noticing a whole lot compared to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other brands I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm getting great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys are a sponsor of mine,
but they are a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out what I'm doing over on my page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of growers that are
getting in early trying these guys out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pH balanced, but they don't
actually advertise that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me perfectly, they pH bang on
right where I want to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm having great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say anything bad about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there additives in there as well on
that line that you're using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use CalMeg and Micro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also use Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not use Grow with my auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow is off the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used it before, but I found it was
just raising up my PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really giving me the growth that
I needed in the early stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pulled that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of that, I add a bud booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add a microbial product called Monkey
Juice, which is a new product here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is basically like microbial mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help your root system take
off in the early stages and make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have a better chance to
get big and beautiful flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the only thing I add on top of
this that these guys don't have for a
[SPEAKER_00]: product yet is resin from Green Planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a phenomenal product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed a tremendous amount of
difference from using it and not using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supposed to come out with a
product like that, but we don't see it
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Green Planet is still in my garden and
they'll probably be there for a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still some stages because I'm super
excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people they'll get,
you know, especially beginners,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get caught up on the whole feeding
thing, when to feed, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how much to feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a feeding chart that you're
following that they put out or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nutrients come with a feeding chart
right on the back of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do find that a lot of nutrient
companies, they're not dialed in to
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily auto flowers, even though
they're very similar to photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do recommend doing a half dose
originally until you get into about week
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to overfeed these girls and
stress them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of describe it almost like
parenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a child, you have a certain
period of time until they're 18 and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make mistakes throughout that
grow, chances are something might go
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would do half dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you get used to things and get
dialed in, they can take full dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done full dose and half dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had success.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just all depends on what kind of
cultivar you get in there and what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of, what you have dialed in for
temperatures and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're on the other side of this
and you're getting started with nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're introducing them, don't panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow the chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half dose, quarter dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move your way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get to the top, you'll
realize what they can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find a lot of us as growers,
we're so passionate about this because at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end you see such a cool product that
you're like, you just love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we over complicate things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're scaring growers away
from getting into gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I like to keep things
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That and a lot of these words,
I can't even pronounce them just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: rescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep it simple at first and move up,
I guess is the right answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you start the feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start my feeding right in week two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The week two is when I start my feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I introduced Cal Mag,
Micro and the Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very small amount of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two mils per gallon of Cal Mag,
two mils per gallon of the Micro and then
[SPEAKER_00]: one mil per gallon of the Bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mixed it into a five gallon jug.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way there I got water on standby and
I'm watering every other week,
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing my nutrients as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask if you monitor the PPM
or EC at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't monitor the EC, but I do monitor
the PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the PPM, I'm just trying to keep it
dialed in throughout my stages of my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a seedling, I want to be anywhere
from 500 to 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as we move into veg, I typically
bring it up to 800 or 900.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're in our flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep that dialed in around a
thousand to 1100.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find if I go up any higher than 1100,
I have pushed it to 12, 1250 before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just find the girls really don't perform
as well in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start burning, start figuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you do get a lockout or
deficiency at that point, you've got a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrients in that soil that you're
going to have to try to get out super hard
[SPEAKER_00]: with auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I monitor it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I did just have a very unsuccessful
run where I kind of got away from
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really get back to the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't using my pH tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't using my PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just mixing my nutrients the same
way I normally did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we lost a lot of girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing is monitor as much stuff
as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't got into all of the monitoring
systems that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the tools that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can get your hands on tools,
definitely advanced as you become more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more in tune with your growing style and
get the proper tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes we can get over cocky
and confident in the garden and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: lose your plants and you don't realize,
hey, I got to get back to the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a major factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk about the PPM readings that
you just mentioned, is that the PPM going
[SPEAKER_01]: of your nutrient mix going in before you
feed your plant or are you measuring a
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff, letting the nutrient mix go
through the medium runoff, that
[SPEAKER_01]: measurement, or are you doing a slurry
test?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do a slurry test for measuring
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my PPM, to be honest with you,
I'd like to actually chat with you more
[SPEAKER_00]: about that off air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I check mine coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should be checking it going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not 100% sure on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got back into, I just got into the
PPM about three runs ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm kind of listening to your podcast,
some other guys podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a learner as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an enthusiast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my major thing is to try to keep this
simple, to encourage people and to get
[SPEAKER_00]: people into gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that they see one of my videos,
they get excited, they laugh, they smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This seems like a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: This goofy guy can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chances are I can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the main thing I'm trying to
get across.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get advanced, but for that answer,
I really couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really couldn't get into a technical
side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I'm definitely going
to have to learn for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can touch on that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's good to have the PPM
measurements going in and coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: because going in isn't always going to be
what's coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mix up a 500 PPM nutrient mix and
feed it through your medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then all of a sudden you're at a thousand
runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because while you already have
nutrients in the medium to begin,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like it's an addition to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I recommend kind of monitoring both and
you'll get to that comfort level,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you mentioned, where you don't have
to really do it as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might know like, Hey, on week four on
the feeding chart, you know, this I know
[SPEAKER_01]: comes out, a half dose comes out to 500
PPM and you can look at, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: you track, if you have like a log of
tracking pH and PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know not everybody does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people get away with not doing it and
there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to keep it simple and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I kind of look at my last runoff
measurement, you know, whether it be from
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of days ago when I fed or
whatever and kind of get an idea and
[SPEAKER_01]: guesstimate like, Hmm, do I think I'm
going to need, there's no perfect system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to kind of to guess it and wing
it in some senses, at least in my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't think of that because when I'm
mixing my nutrients, all I'm checking is
[SPEAKER_00]: my pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think to check the PPM because
I'm going based on the guidelines of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Back My Nutrient company to tell me what
it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But super cool because all I'm doing is
reading the runoff and basically it on my
[SPEAKER_00]: last runoff and then doing an equation in
my mind and going, okay, I think there's X
[SPEAKER_00]: amount in that, in that soil right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to dial back next feeding,
maybe just give water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll probably catch me looking over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two whiteboards here down in the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to track as much as I possibly
can so that if I do make a mistake,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can fix it for next run or I can try to
dial it in on that run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's super important for new
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Track everything, even if it's the
stupidest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When lights go on, when they go off,
how much water you give, when you give it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all that is just intel and it's
going to help you become a better gardener
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great points for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: One last thing to mention for PPM before
we move on would be going in isn't always
[SPEAKER_01]: what's coming out and there's going to be
so many variables as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're in enriched soil or soil
that's already amended, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fox farm ocean forest soil is one that
comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's roots organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a coast of Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different of these soils
that already come amended with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they're organic nutrients,
a lot of those, they're not going to show
[SPEAKER_01]: up on your PPM meter until the microbes
break them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So often times I have beginners reach out
to me and they'll say, oh, what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: putting in, it's way higher runoff coming
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, and I didn't even feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe I just watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, and my runoff was higher
than it was when I fed last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's because you probably have
organic nutrients in your medium being
[SPEAKER_01]: broken down by the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's increasing that PPM number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of variables when it
comes to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really this whole PPM thing is,
is just kind of a tool that you can use to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of give you an idea of how many
nutrients it's not perfect by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you touched a little bit on pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what, I want to get a little bit
deeper into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What pH range do you aim for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, during the first 10 days, I don't pH
my water at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I do is I buy distilled baby water
from the supermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know why I used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started using it originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and bought water because I didn't
know what my water was in the tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I use regular water, sorry,
baby water distilled for the first 10
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't pH it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, once I started introducing
nutrients, I pH it anywhere from 6.0 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.5, but typically it runs in right at
6.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where the nutrients pH
balance it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if it doesn't balance there,
depending on what else I'm adding,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'll use some pH or some pH down,
um, to kind of dial everything in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's typically right there,
6.3, 6.4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's throughout the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much throughout the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, flour, I will drop it down to around
6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I can, depending on what I'm
adding, I find once I add the resonant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it drops it down anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now I know you can get a bit more
advanced and there's certain nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that would take at different pH levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I try not to really get into all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had tests with just pHing at those
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they're producing good flours that
taste good and get the job done for lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of a better word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that's kind of how I've been doing
it over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, transitioning over, let's talk about
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, actually I didn't talk to you about
kind of you grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're in a basement, but are you
growing in tents or are you just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: an open basement?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what are you using for lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I've got a built room down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, built rooms out of two by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a 12 by eight by eight feet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then it's Panda filmed,
um, with a Panda skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a white plastic with a black
blacking, uh, keep the light out or keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the light in, I guess for, for whatever
way you want to do there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I run three lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got two lights on each side,
which are crunk row 4,000, which are very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to the spider farm 4,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they call it a 4,000, but it actually
only pulls 450 true Watts from the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got 450 Watts on each side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I run a crunk row 2,000 in the
middle, which is 250 Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only turn the middle light on during
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find during flower, I have to space my
girls out a bit more and I'm not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: proper light penetration on all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put in a filler light just to kind of
help them out, throw flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can only run it around 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because of my temperatures down here,
in the basement, depending on which time
[SPEAKER_00]: of the year I'm growing, we're going into
fall now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be good to run them at full power
once we're in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I typically try to keep them right
around 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find is the sweet points to the,
you don't burn them and you're not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: too much heat in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the energy admitted from grow lights
par photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the energy that the lights admit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Common measurement is PPFD, photosynthetic
photon flux density.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's commonly what's used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some growers, they'll give their plants a
certain amount of par during the different
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll, they'll slowly kind of increase
the amount of par they give their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you measuring par at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you adjust through different stages of
growth or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not measuring par.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't have a par reader or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I am giving them different
intensities throughout the grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, at different heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started off around 24 inches above
the, uh, above the pot when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm only running in about 20,
25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I mean by that, it's got a dial on
the outside of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously you can picture me
turning at 25, 50%, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep it about 25% value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just gradually move it up and
up and up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your plants are going to tell you,
they're going to show you signs of heat
[SPEAKER_00]: stress if they're too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another way to do it that simple is
just put your plant or start your hand
[SPEAKER_00]: over top of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your hand can stand there for a
long period of time, the chances are the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are going to be able to as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your hand's getting super hot and
starting to burn, you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: dial it down or raise it up depending on
what situation you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I do adjust it throughout the
grow, but no par testing whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be interested to see what these are
pulling for par, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how much are those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they affordable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those things you can order online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you get those kinds of testers
Chris?
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend the Apogee, uh, either MQ 500
or the MQ 620.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that might be a different model
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The MQ 500 is going to be good for both
LED and HID lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So HPS, MH, CMH, and then the MQ 620.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an extended range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these LED grow lights these
days, they're going to extend beyond the
[SPEAKER_01]: normal 400 to 700 nanometer range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, they're about the
Apogee ones that I recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're over 500, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like 525 for the MQ 500 and
like 575 for the MQ 620.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are cheaper par ranges out there
that I haven't used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard there's some inaccuracy issues
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've just avoided it altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the tips that you mentioned,
you can kind of get away with not spending
[SPEAKER_01]: that much money on a par meter just to
kind of get your light distance dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also look at the par chart on the
actual grow light listing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually any grow light these days,
most good grow lights are going to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: par chart on there and it'll show you kind
of like a top view.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a square and it shows you
different PPFD levels throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in different heights,
and you can kind of use that as a guide to
[SPEAKER_01]: determine what the light distance should
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like 98% of growers probably do
it that route and it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, they are super expensive,
but it's worth it to some who want to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of play around with things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a buddy tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the type of tool you talk your
buddy into buying so that you can borrow
[SPEAKER_00]: from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the smart move there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about light cycle for auto
flash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you run for light cycle for
autos?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cool thing with auto flowers is you
can run any light cycle you want to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can run them for six hours a day,
10 hours a day, 20 hours a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put them in your window still and
still be successful and grow a full
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over here at Basement Auto Flowers,
we literally run them like slaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we run them 24 hours a
day is because when I started,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't have a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to run down and shut them
off and not be consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that maybe that would mess them
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ran them 24 hours a day and then
that's kind of how I dialed in my process.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're running them 24 hours a day,
you can keep your temperatures consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep your humidity consistent,
your temperatures in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make sure everything's consistent
because your lights are really the major
[SPEAKER_00]: factor of heat in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having that light off, then you might
have to introduce a heater and having that
[SPEAKER_00]: light on, you can have a fan in there,
an exhaust fan, to make sure that your
[SPEAKER_00]: heat is not getting too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the major reasons why I
run them 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other major reason is just I found
that it worked the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran them 18 and 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 24 hours a day seemed to be,
you know what, these girls are doing okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're having fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go in at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it worked good for my schedule and I
can garden at my own leisure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to wait for the lights to
come on or off to kind of get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 24 hours a day, we are grinding them
out in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I feel like there are pros and cons
to 24 hour light cycle, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought up a great pro, which I think
is a big pro, in my opinion, is the
[SPEAKER_01]: stability in your environment,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once the lights go off,
you could have a pretty significant
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and humidity swing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And too high of swings too often could
stress out the plant to the point where it
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes hermaphrodite, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So having that stable temperature,
humidity, 24 hours a day is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: The downside is during lights off is when
plants send down those exudates down to
[SPEAKER_01]: the root zone, the rhizosphere,
and then secondary metabolites are also
[SPEAKER_01]: produced during lights off.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things major secondary
metabolite is resin, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The resin production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like there are pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, somebody will argue that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you feel like the 24 hour a day is
more beneficial for you, the plant will
[SPEAKER_01]: still grow, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, clearly you're still getting good
results and it's keeping your temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: and humidity stable, so either way will
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really glad you brought that up
because I think that's an excellent point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biggest thing is being a new
grower is your temperatures are super
[SPEAKER_00]: important, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be what stresses you
out the most when your humidity is spiking
[SPEAKER_00]: and your temperature is dropping and
raising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't dial that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't enjoy being a gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't kind of enjoy watching these
plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're worried about everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're either spraying the walls down to
bring the humidity up or you're filling
[SPEAKER_00]: your humidifier every frigging day,
every second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of relax, maybe start out
with 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you find you're getting success and
you start getting that confidence,
[SPEAKER_00]: then go to 18 and 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way there you know what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already got the right tools in
place because there's nothing worse than
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spend your money on the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You plant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get fully invested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden you don't have a
successful run because you can't keep your
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the major mindset of why I
went 24 hours a day, but I kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck there because it works perfect for
my schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got young kids, so I need to be in
and out of that garden as quick as I can
[SPEAKER_00]: and do it at any time when I get a few
minutes to kind of get things done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a new grower just starting
out, you might not have the money for the
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you might need a dehumidifier,
which are big bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: A humidifier, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to raise that humidity
heater potentially, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just starting out and you don't
have the funds for that, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: a 24 hour light cycle may be better for
you so you can keep that stable
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, really, really good points.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you dove into that deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of temperature, what do you aim
for for temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to go below 18 degrees
Celsius and I don't like to go above 29
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees, 30 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are going to be situations where
you have no control over the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother nature is right outside of a
basement and a basement is known to retain
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture and heat and cooling depending on
what time of year, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very difficult to keep it in those
ranges, but as long as you got the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: tools to do it, then you're going to be
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got AC Infinity fans in there for
both intake and outtake.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got power fans in each corner to
make sure that the air is constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got humidifiers in each corner as
well to make sure that our humidity can be
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a heater on standby and air
conditioning on standby, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: which way those fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So realistically, 18 degrees, don't go
below it and 29 degrees don't go above it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically what I find is seedlings are
going to like that higher heat to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: get them through in that higher humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then flowers are going to like those
lower temps with that lower humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing them out to make sure that you
can get perfect flowers without causing
[SPEAKER_00]: any rot or any problems whatsoever due to
temperature problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's 64 degrees to 84 degrees
Fahrenheit for those of you working in
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit, the very few people,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The very few Americans, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: America is the only ones that use
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few things I use Fahrenheit for,
but Delcius is how we kind of do all of
[SPEAKER_00]: our temps over here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you too, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you aim for for humidity
throughout?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do different stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those stages of growth during the seedling
stage, I've got my humidifiers running 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to keep our humidity 65,
60%, 70 in that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to go higher than 70 and I
don't want to go lower than 60 during the
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you don't have a humidifier,
some cool little tricks that you can do to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep your humidity up are spraying the
walls of your tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this can be harmful because you can
obviously get mold in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way is wetting a rag or a towel
hanging it from the top of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few other ways that you can do it is
just clear cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So buy clear cups from the dollar store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Place it over top of your seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help keep the humidity high
by the seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my humidifiers help me dial it in to
60 to 70% during the seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I gradually dial that down once
we're in the vegetative stage and we know
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're really healthy and they're
doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually drop it right around 55% and
then in the end flowering stage anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: from 45 to 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we like to cure 45 to 50 with a 7
to 10 day hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: So humidity is crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was to tell anybody what tools you
should buy first, number one, obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: you need a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, I would say get a humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are you're going to have a
humidifier before you have a dehumidifier,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on where you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in a basement like me,
you're going to need both, humidifier and
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier to make sure that you can
keep stuff dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you supplementing CO2 at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way that I'm supplementing CO2 is
with CO2 enhancers from TMB Naturals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a few canisters around my
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people introduce them early stages,
but a lot of people would argue that
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings don't need a whole lot of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I introduce mine around week three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I start bringing the canisters
into the room, shaking them on a daily
[SPEAKER_00]: basis, trying to bring my CO2 up in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't last very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They last about a week to two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do notice a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never tested it to see if it's
spiking my CO2, but based on just my eye
[SPEAKER_00]: appeal, how my plants are performing and
how well they're doing, I would definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend trying it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few different manufacturers out
there that are making CO2 products,
[SPEAKER_00]: but TMB Naturals has been a fantastic
product for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've also got pH up and pH down that I
use as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to check them out,
I would definitely check out them for a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, affordable way to introduce CO2 in
your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use those same canisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent me over a box of goodies and I
actually did measure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can speak about that here real quick
is my natural CO2 PPM, it's measured in
[SPEAKER_01]: PPM, was like 450 in my grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I added in the canister and I
would often bring it up 800,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most I've seen is 1200 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it definitely works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hung it over the plants as well because
they say CO2 is heavy and it kind of sinks
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can either hang it above the plants
or play the lazy card and just put it on
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground and have a fan blowing it off
the ground into your grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've done it both ways and honestly,
I measured it both ways and I didn't see
[SPEAKER_01]: much of a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you don't have too big of a
space, you could usually get away with one
[SPEAKER_00]: or two canisters, which are going to run
you anywhere from 30 to $35, I believe,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's awesome results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited that you tested it because
chances are in my room with the four
[SPEAKER_00]: canisters, I imagine I'm getting up around
those levels as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you touched upon how seedlings don't
need as much CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of just want to go a little bit
deeper into this because this is a very
[SPEAKER_01]: common question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a general rule out there and it's
actually in my book as well is like you
[SPEAKER_01]: want air exchange every one to three
minutes, one to five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the air is being changed in your grow
space, you're in a safe position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if your plants are just seedlings,
they're tiny, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have many leaves in order to
intake that CO2, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in a four foot by four foot
grow space with some seedlings,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to need to change the air
that frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get away with just opening up your
grow tent and waving the air in and out
[SPEAKER_01]: once a day, you know, when it's seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten away with that little amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when your plants grow bigger,
has more leaves, maybe it's a four by four
[SPEAKER_01]: tent where it's wall to wall with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, you want to have much more
frequent air exchange, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they'll eat up that CO2 a lot more
quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people out there, beginners,
you might have heard that general rule
[SPEAKER_01]: between one to five minutes, change out
the grow space, but just keep your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: size in mind as well, right?
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, those are good points for sure,
because a lot of people don't understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that you need a fan to change the air in
your grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the major thing is just get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a fan to get started at
first, just get in there and start getting
[SPEAKER_00]: everything going, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about plant training?
[SPEAKER_01]: What plant training techniques do you do
for auto flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So believe it or not, a lot of people
think I'm crazy for this, but I top every
[SPEAKER_00]: single one of my auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I top them every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One top typically around the fifth or
sixth node is when I top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's typically right around day 13,
14, 15, right in that range, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: which kind of plant I got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I top them and then I start low stress
training them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as I top and that main stem
split, all I do is take each node and tie
[SPEAKER_00]: them to the outsides of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the nice grommets around the
grow bags and these tie the plants down
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I'm doing is adjusting them
accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you don't top, I still recommend
using low stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one very easy way to produce a higher
yield in your plant and get big and
[SPEAKER_00]: better, better flowers realistically at
the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to top, all I recommend
doing is taking that main node,
[SPEAKER_00]: tying it down and just want to go
clockwise or counterclockwise and start
[SPEAKER_00]: moving it around your pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a daily basis, once it ties down and
comes right back up, just move over a node
[SPEAKER_00]: and tie her down and keep moving it
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to allow those bottom
branches to kind of come up and give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice even canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get more top, bigger buds and more
product at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do anything particular to prevent
pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, but my wife does for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife is a cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one, there's two ways you can
get pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one would be having a dirty grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really need to make sure that
you're cleaning these tents out or
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning your grow room out and come up
with a solution that works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now over here, we clean it, we mop it,
we wipe it down with soap and water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we come back with a peroxide
water mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spray our walls all down to try to kill
anything that's still in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some people out there that
use bleach and things along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't bring anything like that into my
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the major thing is when you're
using soil, you don't want to overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overwatering is definitely going to stunt
the growth of your plants, but it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: going to invite pests in to lay eggs in
your soil and you don't want pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only had them a few times over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife is very diligent and she makes
sure that the grow room is thick and span.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a couple of videos where I had like
a little bit of dirt on the ground and
[SPEAKER_00]: she's like, can't be showing dirt like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the type of mom that like,
you need to make the beds if people are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming over because they're going to run
upstairs and see if your bed's unmade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pests are definitely an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to take precautions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a clean room, having dry soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not all dry all the time,
but just make sure that it's not staying
[SPEAKER_00]: wet for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way there your pests don't come in
and take over your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for sprays and things like that,
I have a few things don't stand by,
[SPEAKER_00]: but knock on wood, I've had pretty good
run with no pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you didn't jinx me on this one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just blame it on me if you get pests,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be making a video to blame it on
you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually have a video on cleaning your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to reiterate your mixture here,
you had one part, is it hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_01]: to three parts water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll kill all the bad bacteria,
bad and good bacteria actually kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: sterilizes the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a cheap, affordable way to
sterilize your grow room and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that if there is any residue or any mold
or anything sticking around, that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to try to kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is just make sure when
you're watering or you're in there with
[SPEAKER_00]: water, wipe up your water immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know sometimes we can get in there and
get lazy and we spill a bit of water or
[SPEAKER_00]: we're mixing our nutrients and they'll
spill in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the time to really kind of clean all
your products, clean your gear and get
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for a new run because there's
nothing worse than being halfway through a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and then you're wondering what's
going wrong and you look underneath your
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and you've got bugs or you've got
bugs moving around in your soil and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very discouraging and it really ruined a
gardener's experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cleanliness is number one over here for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple more things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're growing your plants,
you're feeding your autoflowers all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way up until what point are you giving
your plant a period of like a flush period
[SPEAKER_01]: or leaching?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will stop nutrients two weeks
prior to harvest, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will feed all the way up at
the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I try to do, so it all depends on
when I think the autoflower is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on what kind of brand you're
growing, you're going to find that certain
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers are going to be nine weeks,
some are going to be 10, some are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stop typically two weeks before I
think they're going to be finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dial back all nutrients and get rid of
them completely and I just start to flush
[SPEAKER_00]: with pH balanced water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now pH in this water at 6.0 to 6.3 as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a table set up in there with
a mesh top on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take my plant, I put it on top of the
mesh stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a five gallon bucket under it and
I'm stoking it until the runoff is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely running through and I'm getting
enough to test down at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get my PPM down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to come back down to that seedling
stage around four or 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can even get it lower than that,
if I have RO water on standby,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'll even try to get it lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I definitely think a flush makes a
huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran a test over here where I ran the
exact same strain and tested them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one was flushed, one wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you notice a major difference when you
try these later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do flush and I do recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of timing it perfectly
so you can get all those nutrients out
[SPEAKER_00]: before they're not taken up anymore and
you got to chop and trim and dry and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that terrible stuff that we all hate to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A common practice before harvesting is to
give some folks will give their plants a
[SPEAKER_01]: period of darkness before harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest with you, I have and I
haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of crazy things out
there and speculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not quite sure if it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also taken ice and put ice on my pot,
ice the water down so that I guess what
[SPEAKER_00]: some people say is that it makes the plant
think that it's fall and it starts paging
[SPEAKER_00]: the colors and bringing out color content
and making the plant think that it's done,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have done that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done all kinds of craziness in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually thinking about putting a
spoof video together about absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous things that you do to your
plants before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be funny because we all have
so many ridiculous ideas of what works and
[SPEAKER_00]: what doesn't work, but I don't think
there's any science background on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll have to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe eventually they'll come out and tell
us if it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you know something, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the thought process behind it is,
I touched on this earlier, secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites happen during lights off,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That resin production happens during
lights off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the theory behind it is that it's going
to provide more resin on your plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we know if it works or is it up in the
air?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have done studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you search lost leaf, I believe it is,
he did a study.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he measured THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if he measured the terpene
profile or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember, but he does some of his
own individual studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's been any large
studies that have been repeatable that
[SPEAKER_01]: show that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think it's still up in the air
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see everyone posting this two hours or
two days of darkness, 48 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness, and everyone's getting excited,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we definitely do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it makes a difference,
but in my heart- It doesn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my heart it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a difference in my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it'll hurt the plant at all,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to do anything detrimental
at all.
No, it's not going to harm it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there any other advice you can think
of that you would give people who are new
[SPEAKER_01]: to growing auto flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're new to growing auto flowers,
just stick with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're definitely going to get little itty
bitty babies at first, but the more that
[SPEAKER_00]: you dial in your process, the better
you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, there's a lot of people
on these platforms that are growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all doing a fantastic job,
but there's so many variables to come into
[SPEAKER_00]: play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't take a cookie cutter
gardening experience and put it into your
[SPEAKER_00]: room and expect it to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to change it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing is find a medium that
you think you might like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a light that you're going to like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start picking away your gear as you get
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to save money eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing is to get started
growing so you can have some fun,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow some product that saves some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, you're going to
get better product than you're buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So realistically, Chris, the main thing is
just get started, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be discouraged by all these awesome
growers on these platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, we all make
mistakes and we just don't show them on
[SPEAKER_00]: our platform because, well, no one wants
to look at a shitty plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wrapping things up, how can listeners
find you and what do you have upcoming in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Listeners can find me over on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started YouTube very, very short
period of time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to put out good content,
simple content to try to motivate people
[SPEAKER_00]: to start gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also find me over on Instagram,

Flowers grow bags, three gallon,

Flowers, Auto Flower Grow Off.
