[SPEAKER_00]: Pretend like you're walking into your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain what equipment you had
back then, how it was set up, how many
[SPEAKER_00]: plants you were growing, so on and so
forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, previously I would say like a
month or two before the pen might grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: before you guys all came out, I was like
trying different things that I was on
[SPEAKER_01]: OfferUp and I was on my Facebook groups,
like getting different tints and trying
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all like tints that would have
like holes and a little low rip on the
[SPEAKER_01]: side or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's the room that you guys ended
up coming in that had a couple plants in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you go back to my YouTube a
couple previous videos before that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a huge 10 by 10 I got from somebody
on OfferUp with no like, I still have a
[SPEAKER_01]: small light in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no intake fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no like fans move around the air
and I kept walking in that one room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys came in to help build up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It pretty much you couldn't even walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like you walk in, barely did,
just cracked the door and walked in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like 100 degrees, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was only able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way I'm going to be able to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is super cheap, like almost camping
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up taking that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time I had so many plants that
it just wasn't working out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know how to like control my BPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know how to do any of that,
especially with the stuff I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still trying, but I would watch
videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew what I was supposed to get target
wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wasn't hitting for me in areas and
different types of tent that wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So originally when you guys hit me up,
Joe told me, he was like, yo, this is
[SPEAKER_01]: really dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see everything you're doing,
but we can't come with these plants bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has to be proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that was sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know, this is super dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up basically making everything
the way it needed to be, to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to have a dope show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took so many plants to my
girlfriend's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in the big U-Haul boxes that you hang
those in, like packed those in and took
[SPEAKER_01]: all my plants to my girlfriend's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that time that I had to bring
everything back and everything is just,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything was so dead and everything is
so bent over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, it was wild, a wild time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely a moment to remember forever,
but it is such a crazy story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember walking into your old setup and
you had the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you, how were you, it was on some
sort of, I'm trying to think of what do
[SPEAKER_01]: you even call that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a, two, two tripod posts for like
regular lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like the, I forgot the brand,
but two regular soft light sticks,
[SPEAKER_01]: tripods, and a pole across it for hanging
backdrop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a Viperspectra 150 on one side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe, yeah, I think two
Viperspectra's hanging on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just giving the plants enough light
to keep them alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was an open room at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no air exhausting out the room
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of just like not even a sealed
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, when you guys came, I was like
on the verge of like, it was almost over
[SPEAKER_01]: for my plants, like almost over for my
growing career in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't even know that it could go
any farther or go like, I had all these
[SPEAKER_01]: dreams and stuff, but I didn't know that I
could keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know I was gonna be able to keep
going any of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you guys reached out and I
actually like, not one, I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the hell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I originally seen the link,
one of my friends sent the link and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like a video he made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason for me to even sign up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I signed up and actually got hit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, there's no way I've never
won anything in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are people I watched every at
that point.
