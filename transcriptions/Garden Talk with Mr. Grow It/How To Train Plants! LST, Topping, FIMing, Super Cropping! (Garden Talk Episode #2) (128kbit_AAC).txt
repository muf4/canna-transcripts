[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and
[SPEAKER_00]: today I got a discussion video for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about plant training.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different things you can
do when it comes to training plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, I'm not only going to tell
you what I do when I train my plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm bringing a guest into this
discussion, Pigeons420.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a YouTuber with over 74,000
subscribers and he has over 800 grow
[SPEAKER_00]: videos on his channel and he's been doing
YouTube since I believe the beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to his channel, which I'll link
down in the description section below,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see he does a ton of different
plant training techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like these types of discussion
videos, please hit that thumbs up button.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an indication to whether or not I
should make more of these videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, let's get into the discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, got Pigeons here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm really excited to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an overdue conversation,
I guess I'd say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time we've ever actually
done a video chat like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've both been doing
YouTube videos for over three,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, three, four years now,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, dude, I'm super psyched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as I said, thanks for having me,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more importantly, thank you for,
for, for being kind of, kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, uh, a shining light in the community
when it comes to bringing the community
[SPEAKER_02]: together and, uh, and getting,
getting, getting the best out of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the, the show that you did with Rob
and I really enjoyed the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you guys really brought the best
out of each other when it came to,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the conversation, pulling out ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I think this is, this is a,
this is a good avenue for content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about plant training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, you know, I really wanted to
bring you into this discussion because
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been on your channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I see a lot, you do a lot of
different types of plant training
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, uh, you know, today you can talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're going to talk about
all the plant training techniques that are
[SPEAKER_00]: out there, but definitely the most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So low stress training, topping,
if we can get into it, maybe do a little
[SPEAKER_00]: super cropping or filming things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there are other things, other ways to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably won't get into it all in this
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you viewers ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heads up on that one, but let's start off
with, I do it'll be the most common,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is low stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is low stress training?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So low stress training is, uh,
really bending down and, or tying down
[SPEAKER_00]: branches in order to allow other branches
to grow up and, you know, even with that
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy, um, it's kind of the basic
definition of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your definition of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that kind of the same thing or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stress training, trying not to create
anything that's going to prolong the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant's life and stress will certainly
prolong the plant's life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just gentle bending, tying down is a
great way to put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tucking of even just a tucking of leaves,
I think is a low stress training.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, just, just anything that's hands
on, that's not creating too much stress
[SPEAKER_02]: for the plant in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why low stress train?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the point of low stress training?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think ideally the most common reason
for low stress training is to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've read on websites that,
um, it's up to a 40% increase in yield
[SPEAKER_00]: just from doing low stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think, what do you think the
reasons are for doing low stress training?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that, that, that is exactly it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to create the most out of your
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I, when I first started growing,
I remember when I would look into a,
[SPEAKER_02]: a package of seeds and on the back,
it would give you the strain, the contents
[SPEAKER_02]: of the cannabis, but then it would give
you a, a, and I, a time frame and an
[SPEAKER_02]: average yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was looking at numbers that,
that looked so unobtainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're talking 500 grams,
300 grams of some, some, some number that
[SPEAKER_02]: went along with those, those, those,
those beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tried to figure out how on earth
you're going to be able to maximize your,
[SPEAKER_02]: those numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you get those numbers?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best way to do that is to,
to, to try to pull the most out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, ensure that you're going to expose
more possible tops to get buds from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you can, you can certainly do
that with low stress training.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, to maximize the yield that you're
going to get out of the plant by
[SPEAKER_02]: maximizing the size and potential of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you usually start low stress
training?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, it starts really early.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm, when I'm describing this to a
new grower, I'm going to tell someone to
[SPEAKER_02]: wait till the third node.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a rule of thumb, but the
reality of it is your plant is going,
[SPEAKER_02]: is going through stresses almost
immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're trying to minimize the
amount of stress that a seedling goes
[SPEAKER_02]: through, but you can certainly start
flexing well, well after the first node.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you start to see some kind of
sprout coming out after your, your
[SPEAKER_02]: original, what are those first leaves
called?
[SPEAKER_02]: Culledon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first node after that, typically you
can start to give it a little bend,
[SPEAKER_02]: get a little bit of, of hands on to start
to beef in that stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll go as early as the first node
after the first node.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, you know, it really depends on
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on my schedule, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm not available to start low
stress training that, that early,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, starting early, I typically like
to wait till the third to fifth node,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll start bending the main
branch down from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sometimes, you know, it really depends
on growth as well, because some like
[SPEAKER_00]: indica strains, for example, can be real
naturally squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's more of a stretchy strain,
like a sativa stretchy strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: like an OG or something like that,
at the third node, the thing's already,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, seven to ten inches tall
potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing it at the third node,
you know, is always a potential as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it really depends on growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, I guess that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends on the, the,
the sex of seed as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, if you, if you don't know your,
your, your sex, training that early might
[SPEAKER_02]: not make as much sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're, you might be putting in
too much effort for something that might
[SPEAKER_02]: not be going the full distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you might not have a female.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm, if I'm running regular seeds,
typically I'm actually going to start
[SPEAKER_02]: training a little bit later, but then it
kind of goes hand in hand with the more
[SPEAKER_02]: training you're going to, you're almost
going to see signs of sex sooner based on
[SPEAKER_02]: stress, kind of anecdotal and through my
own experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I knew I had sex earlier,
if I had a regular seed or sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry, sorry, a feminized seed,
I am going to put stress on that plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: that seed a lot sooner than something that
I didn't know the outcome of.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually went to your channel and I saw
a video directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It relates to this is, is when to start
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you had a plant that you did no
training on and it was like close to three
[SPEAKER_00]: feet, maybe two feet, three feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you mad hittled the thing and it
was just straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you may handle it and literally
brought it in like a swirl coming around.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that turn out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had a plan at three feet and then
just may handle it, bent it like crazy and
[SPEAKER_00]: then wrapped it all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then can you talk a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially you mentioned it earlier when
you, when it came down to schedule,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, growing your plants relies heavily on
your schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're there, then you know,
they're going to benefit a little more,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit more than if you're not
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This particular plant got, I think it was
even upwards of four feet high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was sheer ignorance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just let it get the best of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kept, I kept doing other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you get, if you have a full
flower room, you know, it's easy to let
[SPEAKER_02]: the veg room kind of, kind of,
kind of get a little bit behind where it
[SPEAKER_02]: should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that's what happened in this
case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this girl, in fact, um, it was a,
uh, I believe it was, it was new dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that was the strain it, uh,
it, it got way too high unmanageable,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I knew through experience that this
wasn't something to be worried about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew that I could bring this to a size
manageable, something that I could deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my first, my first response was to
bend it in half, take, take, take,
[SPEAKER_02]: take that four feet and turn it into two
feet, because at least now I'm,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an indoor grower, so I can't,
I don't have the sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sky's not the limit for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I decided to manipulate that step.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, and at four feet, we're talking
about a stem that's already almost in
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe an inch, inch and a half thick
already and with no training.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I decided to just really manipulate
that stem, get it nice and loose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, as you really started to,
to, to break that membrane, it almost
[SPEAKER_02]: starts, she started to just fall over on
her own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was just a matter of just
getting her down, tying her to the pot and
[SPEAKER_02]: ensuring that all that undergrowth was
going to start coming upwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a matter of fact, I still have the,
I refer to it as the antlers of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of the, the stem that was the new dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I trimmed it up and it still sits in a
back room in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I, I'm so attached to that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not ready to get rid of her.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to think if I should lack her
up and put her up as like a trophy on top
[SPEAKER_02]: of the garden or something, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: She, she yielded, she yielded wonderfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I didn't weigh my harvest,
but we, we got quite a few jars off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Off of, off of that girl, I'd say in and
around the half to the three quarters of
[SPEAKER_02]: a, of a, of a P, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a good, it was a good,
it was a good haul.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a happy camper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was beneficial for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you say that there's no,
it's never too late to start low stress
[SPEAKER_00]: training?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go hands on at any time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, even when you're in flower,
I would still suggest going hands on for
[SPEAKER_02]: at least the first few weeks to ensure
that you know, while the plant's using up
[SPEAKER_02]: those starches and those sugars and
enjoying that stretch, that it's not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to become too uneven, that you're having
some, some, some flowers that are closer
[SPEAKER_02]: to the light and some that aren't,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, it's never too late, never too
late.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant should be just the way you want
it before you put it into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that means you need to train it at
week eight, 12 or 15 in veg, then you got
[SPEAKER_02]: to get her done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get her done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that one time where I bent a branch
down and it was a similar situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it was as, as big as,
as what you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant ended up being very unstable and
that main stem still continued to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: main stem and had the largest bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing was just flopping all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that happen with, with yours or no?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once, like once you, once I bent her over,
it was, it was, it was imperative that I
[SPEAKER_02]: gave those other stems as much,
here I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my, this is the technique I use on
the stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I roll them through my fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do this all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walk through the garden in the mornings
and roll all these little stems through my
[SPEAKER_02]: fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I must roll, you know, upwards of a
hundred stems a morning as I just come
[SPEAKER_02]: through the garden with my coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea was with that particular
girl, once she was flipped over,
[SPEAKER_02]: was to just manipulate all those shoots,
all those tops to ensure that none of them
[SPEAKER_02]: got left behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you got to, we have to remember
that sometimes not every top is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a potential bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've, you've got to just get rid of
some.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to keep her clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to keep your canopy fresh,
open, and, and, and available for,
[SPEAKER_02]: to take in fresh air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're keeping every single top,
you're going to have some buds that are
[SPEAKER_02]: huge, some that are small.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and it's just, it's important to
just, yeah, get, get hands on,
[SPEAKER_02]: on all of those individual buds so that
they all get that, that, that strength
[SPEAKER_02]: that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link that video in the description
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for anybody who wants to see that,
I definitely recommend you click on that
[SPEAKER_00]: video and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's, it's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I was blown away with what you did,
but with that thing, I was laughing a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was like, what the heck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and yeah, the story of the new dog,
that one, I remember that she was a good
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So low stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what exactly do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'll typically do that
initial first bend when it's on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, roughly it's fifth node,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it depends on growth and I'll
bend that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really, it normally only really
takes what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a week, 10 days, maybe two weeks
before you have to actually bend down
[SPEAKER_00]: other branches as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I'm continually bending down
branches and tying them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, a new main shoot kind of
comes up and dominates, I'll bend that
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm, I'm constantly tying
things down and just trying to create the,
[SPEAKER_00]: make the canopy even at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll continue to do that all the way
up, uh, really into flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that three week stretch,
I'll still continue to do low stress
[SPEAKER_00]: training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still continue to pull down those
branches, tie them down in order to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep an even canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that really that first three
weeks, when you flip the flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the plant is still stretching,
it's kind of like the hardest,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion, to still control and create
even canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's a lot easier when the
plant is in veg, just because you get,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a plant can grow what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like two inches overnight or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit harder to control,
in my opinion, but that's kind of when I
[SPEAKER_00]: stop is really after that stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you do, um, low stress train?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when do you stop it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm, I'm, I'm very similar in terms of
the starting, starting early with that
[SPEAKER_02]: initial bend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do like I have, but I try to
refrain from tying down or, or pinning
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I do, I do take coat hangers,
metal coat hangers, and I, and I,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I cut them up so that you can keep the
metal pins and I can put those to use as
[SPEAKER_02]: pins for the, for the shoots to kind of
keep them towards the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally I feel as if, if you can get
in there every day, every second day,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's be real, and, and, and twist and
bend those tops, you're going to turn a
[SPEAKER_02]: very small stem into a very thick stem
very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you do pin them down, there's still
that same effect, but I do feel as if you
[SPEAKER_02]: can, every time a top rises up,
and sometimes it can only take three
[SPEAKER_02]: hours, four hours, maybe, maybe a little
bit longer from going in from a flat bend
[SPEAKER_02]: to being straight up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can get back in there and keep
bending that down, I think that's far more
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial than, you know, tying it down,
leaving it, coming back, tying down,
[SPEAKER_02]: leaving it, coming back, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, but that would be more,
that would just, that's just, I guess more
[SPEAKER_02]: my technique than anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly utilize both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both techniques when it comes to pinning
and or bending when it comes to your
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this whole at home virus, this 2020
has allowed me to do a lot more in garden
[SPEAKER_02]: work than I have ever been able to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of learning these little,
little techniques over the last few months
[SPEAKER_02]: that I didn't necessarily know before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but when it comes to as early as
training, yeah, that initial bend,
[SPEAKER_02]: typically it's hands on, bend it down,
still twisting and there's that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that finger, you know, still twisting each
stem and just, just making sure that each
[SPEAKER_02]: stem from going straight up at the,
the end of my visit looks like something
[SPEAKER_02]: stepped on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: She, I don't want any tops pointing the
sky to the sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I leave the flower room after a good
low stress training in the morning,
[SPEAKER_02]: because then I feel like I've gotten,
I've gotten, I've gotten everything taken
[SPEAKER_02]: care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, as early as I can hands on,
and then same thing, not three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're right, it is the hardest
because you're growing in the veg room
[SPEAKER_02]: over the course of, well, in my case is
three plus months of vegging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas you're seeing growth over three
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see a month's worth of growth in
just a couple of days in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, and if you're not quick on the
hands on next thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got, you've got nine inches in
between your flower points or in between
[SPEAKER_02]: your bud, your bud sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I totally agree in terms of that
three weeks is just as important or more
[SPEAKER_02]: important to, to ensure that you can
maintain all that hard work that you put
[SPEAKER_02]: in at throughout the rest of the flower
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the last time I'm training,
you know, you're still, you're still
[SPEAKER_02]: tucking leaves and, and trying to,
trying to separate buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want any buds stuck together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I still think that that in some sense
is low stress training just to ensure that
[SPEAKER_02]: these buds are, they're in their own
isolated environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have two buds that are stuck too
close together.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a leaf that, you know,
say drooped right on top of a,
[SPEAKER_02]: a, a bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I would not remove that leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a high stress training.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, I would just tuck that leaf
underneath that bud so that there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture or any, any trapped air inside
that, that bond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring up a good point with the hand
bending.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I use ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned how I use ties, but there have
been grows where all I did was hand
[SPEAKER_00]: bending.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go in there and just use my hand and
you know, you have to do it like two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three times a day, but hand bending down
and continuing to bend down and you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: those other branches come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've done plants, several grows where
I just do hand bending and no ties
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is still possible to do low stress
training without actually using ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use for ties when you use
ties?
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you use coat hangers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Coat hangers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a, like that's a
underutilized item in our households.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now granted metal coat hangers are kind of
going out with, with the times and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: more of the plastic coat hangers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now granted, I'm sure you could like,
you could manipulate a plastic coat hanger
[SPEAKER_02]: and do the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing, but metal coat hangers have
really got me through because it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I find these things everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got hundreds of metal coat hangers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they don't last forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do corrode and they do eventually go
bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, just to, just to cut a coat
hanger, you cut the, the, the bottom and
[SPEAKER_02]: the middle and you cut the top,
you just take the two sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even take the little, the hook and
cut that off and use that as a hook as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I primarily use either they're,
they're like mechanic ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like pipe ties or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like a, they're like a,
a twist tie, but they're, they're rubber.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my viewers have told me they're like,
they're a mechanics twist tie of sorts
[SPEAKER_02]: and, or garden wire, typically like just a
twist tie, a roll of twist tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And aside from that, yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's mostly why I use
those garden ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like two bucks at your local
gardening store.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a roll of them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the whole roll, like the green tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just take off those ties and
reuse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exactly forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mostly use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I tie the branch, what I do is
I'll wrap that tie around like a loop,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a double wrap, but I won't actually
like twist the ties together because as
[SPEAKER_00]: that branch grows thicker, the way I do
it, cause I'm just continuing to wrap it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll unravel on its own, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't like choke up the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm explaining that
clearly enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just kind of wrapping it around twice
and then as it expands, well, then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: unraveling the tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have to adjust every now and then,
but just a small tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people don't, aren't choking out their,
their stems there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you totally will.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great, that's a great tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still choke out my plants because it's
like, you'll forget about a tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll, you'll come in, make sure I'm
moving ties all the time, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: as the plant gets larger and the more ties
you put down, you're going to forget one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so wrapping them, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've choked out plants way too many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, so on fabric pots,
I think common thing that beginners might
[SPEAKER_00]: be wondering is how do I tie this down to
a fabric pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I usually do is I'll take like a
bobby pin and I'll pierce the side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fabric pot and then, you know,
close off that bobby pin and then take
[SPEAKER_00]: that twist tie and then attach it to the
bobby pin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I do for, um, fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some things with Velcro that
actually wrap all the way around of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can take the Velcro and go up
and bring the branches down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I have a link to that, I know
CoopMed uses it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to CoopMed, he's a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can find the link to that,
I'll link that down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for plastic pots, I usually use
those binder clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really when you're doing low stress
training, just whatever you can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use, I use paper clips myself around a
fabric pot, put a bunch of paper clips
[SPEAKER_02]: around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just tie to the paper clip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people drill holes in the
plastic pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whatever you want to do,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever, whatever you have available
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: To add kind of for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm, I'm exclusively fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use anything aside from a fabric
pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been that way for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know anything different,
but yeah, it's the, the, the paper clip,
[SPEAKER_02]: put the paper clip in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to put about, you'll see it
in that new dog video actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: as a matter of fact, if, if, if anyone
checked the description after the,
[SPEAKER_02]: after the video, um, there was probably 20
some paper clips all the way around that
[SPEAKER_02]: pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just tied.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the downside, of course, is the plant
gets stronger and they are incredibly
[SPEAKER_02]: strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will pull the paper clips out of the,
the fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you gotta be, yeah, you gotta be
vigilant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be vigilant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else for low stress training?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't avoid it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, get hands on and, and, and manipulate
your, your plants to increase yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a necessary, it's a necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can really 40%, I think if that,
if that's the statistic that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's an understatement in terms
of the, the amount of yield you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: increase by doing training.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think it's upwards of, you know,
70% in some cases, but yeah, get hands on,
[SPEAKER_02]: do low training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say I disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as a new grower, you don't have to do
low stress training, but it's extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So topping, what is topping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Topping really just straight basically is
just pinching off or cutting off a piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's that main stem that comes
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happens from there is it'll
kind of split into two and it will have
[SPEAKER_00]: two tops, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that kind of your definition of it as
well or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only are you like you're promoting on
undergrowth as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You remove a top, you're going to get two
tops and then you're going to see an
[SPEAKER_02]: excess amount of energy per promoted to
the undergrowth of the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I usually top, I usually wait
until it's like on his fifth node,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'll top down to, well, actually,
sorry, there's, so there's two ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of top is the pinching method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also the, the cutting
method where I like to call it a hard top,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, is where you're actually taking,
uh, you know, trimmers and trimming off,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done both techniques, you know,
the pinching off is super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pinch off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like to do the hard top where I
cutting usually when I'm pinching,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just wait and then pinch at that
fifth node.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm doing a hard top, you know,
I'll hard, I'll wait till it's fifth node
[SPEAKER_00]: and hard top down to the third node.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, similar to LST, it depends on
growth, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A real stretchy strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a hard top down because I
might have other plants in the garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are slower growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so trying to kind of create,
keep that canopy even between all the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so as far as, you know, when I top,
how I top, it really kind of depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I first started training,
topping is something that I did all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, as I've become more efficient in my
growing, I don't top at all anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I just, I bend, I just bend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find bending does very similar,
uh, has a very similar technique or sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: a very similar effect when it comes to
promoting undergrowth and creating strong
[SPEAKER_02]: stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just, yeah, I, I, once you start
training your plants, you start to you to
[SPEAKER_02]: like the, I find when you're not training
a plant, the energy is focused at the top
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's anything new about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The energy goes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start bending that plant,
the energy is now being delivered to more
[SPEAKER_02]: than just the, the, the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're now seeing a promotion of growth
and that undergrowth or the other,
[SPEAKER_02]: anything other than the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a very similar effect that
when you have a topic, is you remove the
[SPEAKER_02]: top, you then have two tops, but then you
have a promotion of undergrowth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I, yeah, I've just not found topping
to be as beneficial anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when it comes to training,
I just bending has a very similar effect
[SPEAKER_02]: and I end up when it comes to being say
two and a half to three months into veg,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm removing tops at this point because I
have too many, not because I want more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got way, I have way too many.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's through training, you're going to
be removing tops, just, just, just to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: a clean canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's the same thing, I'm not
entirely sure, but yeah, not, not much of
[SPEAKER_02]: a topper anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're being over a great point,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So topping is HST, high stress training,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a high stress training technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing physical damage to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, really, uh, you know, if you're
cutting off the top of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: plants can use some of that energy for
recovery, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could, you know, slow down the
growth and most likely going to slow down
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth a little bit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it takes to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bending down, arguably just doing LST,
arguably isn't going to slow down that
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So faster veg time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'll, I'll top, I'll do a
combination of topping and low stress
[SPEAKER_00]: training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, you know, I'll top down,
I'll top the fifth node, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'll bend all those branches down
and then just do low stress training for
[SPEAKER_00]: the remainder of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some plants, I'm just doing that one
top, one top of the fifth node,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then spreading out all those lower
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've done other techniques where I top
down, like I said, wait till the fifth
[SPEAKER_00]: node, top down to the third node and I'll
remove the first node, leave the second
[SPEAKER_00]: node.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so many different things you
can do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I really recommend people to kind
of experiment with, with topping and low
[SPEAKER_00]: stress training, all these different
training techniques that we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's so many different ways to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I've, I've done both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and also I've done multiple tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do that first initial top,
then I wait a week or so, and then do a
[SPEAKER_00]: another top of those tops and then kind of
wait till those branches develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So topping, so I get, you know,
eight main colas coming up or I could top
[SPEAKER_00]: a third time and get 16 main colas coming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done as much as 32 main colas coming
up on one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just so many ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely recommend people to kind
of experiment with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have experimenting is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Experimenting is key, regardless of what
you hear from, from myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, or yourself is that you're going to
find a way that works for you by,
[SPEAKER_02]: by blending a bunch of the techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started by doing a bunch of topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was the best way to go
topping, get all the tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I, and then when people ask,
how many times do you top?
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up only topping two times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would do the initial top and then maybe
one more top after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, and then, and then just kind of
weaned out to, I find I was getting a
[SPEAKER_02]: similar technique with just the bending.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Experiment, get your hands dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants are resilient.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wonderful that we can discuss a low
stress training and a high stress
[SPEAKER_02]: training.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's, that's pretty special.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, so get your hands dirty,
get your hands on and, and maximize the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the yield, maximize the potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could literally, if you just have
one of those plants where it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: growing straight up and really you're not
getting much side branching at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a beginner and you're kind of
worried about, you know, doing a topping,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could literally just do that one top
and that plant is going to bush out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do any additional
training on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant is going to bush out just
from one initial topping and no additional
[SPEAKER_00]: training.
[SPEAKER_02]: That feeling in your heart of insecurity
and unknowing that the unknown of what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to happen when you talk,
that's normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get over it and it's going
to be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I, I'm sure it happened to you on
the first time that someone told you to
[SPEAKER_02]: chop the top of your plant off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were like, uh, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that feeling deep down is normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, yeah, I want that to be known.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else on topping?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not much else to it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about fimming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever done fimming?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think like inadvertently when you
try to top and I'll let you to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: describe the acronym and what it is,
but because a lot of people, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea of what a fimming is and what it
stands for, uh, don't actually go hand in
[SPEAKER_02]: hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I didn't when I, when I learned the
technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I think, yeah, inadvertently you
end up, you end up fimming when,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, often when you're topping,
um, and, and it's, it's, it's a very
[SPEAKER_02]: similar technique, but you haven't
completely removed the initial top.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there, there's, there's a little bit of
life there to keep going and in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: the energy that's being, being provided.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I've certainly practiced it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one of the same things with topping
though, it's, it's just kind of gone by
[SPEAKER_02]: the wayside with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so FIM or FIMing, FIM stands for I
missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually what it stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google it if you don't believe me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, really it, the name comes from
somebody trying to top, but when they
[SPEAKER_00]: pinched off the top, they missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't actually top off entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just pinched that top growth and
what happened instead of just splitting
[SPEAKER_00]: out in two different directions,
it went to four different directions,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually FIMed and went off three
different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, you know, just cutting out,
not actually like pinching off the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: top, but just kind of pinching off almost
the entire top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could lead to, it's hard to get
accurate actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's hard to exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get that perfect spot to
where it's going to split out into four
[SPEAKER_00]: different branches instead of just two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I've done it accidentally too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I topped right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, it turned out to be a FIM,
which was, it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but it's almost harder to
miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost harder to miss than it is to
get it right, you know, like to get,
[SPEAKER_02]: to get that right miss so that it gives
you those tops, those extra tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost harder to get it wrong than it
is to get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that FIM isn't something that I often
practice to be honest, but I would love to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear from the viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you guys try to FIM on
purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know down in the comment section
below and let us know like when you try to
[SPEAKER_00]: FIM as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's so many different ways to do
it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, what node do you like to FIM
at to get the best result from?
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else on FIMing?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you nailed it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You nailed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not something I practice myself,
but again, something to experiment with.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different techniques and I
think that's the joy of being a gardener
[SPEAKER_02]: in 2020 is that people are trying
everything now and you can almost go and
[SPEAKER_02]: check someone out who's doing it,
you know, and you'll find someone and then
[SPEAKER_02]: pick up some techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever heard of no technique plant
training?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you'd have to explain because maybe
it's not as simple as it sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I came across this on the website
that was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it is is basically taking that main
branch, bending it down 90 degrees and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No other training on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just taking that initial branch,
bending down 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course the lower branches of
stuff are going to grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something actually, when I was
looking at some training websites or
[SPEAKER_00]: websites talking about training right
before, uh, you know, we're talking here
[SPEAKER_00]: today, I came across that and I was
curious to know if you had ever heard of
[SPEAKER_00]: that because it's something that I really
hadn't heard that before and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really know anybody who just bends it down
90 degrees.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be, I, sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, you know, that is another form of
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I would be, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it just cause I've never tried it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't knock it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but initially I think the,
the first bend fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I feel like those under branches
still need some sort of attention in order
[SPEAKER_02]: to give you that maximization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, or maximized potential of the,
the, the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, now I'd be curious though,
are you bending it at three nodes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you bending it at three feet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I'd be curious because maybe at
three feet, if you bend that over,
[SPEAKER_02]: those, those branches are a little farther
along, but I'd be assuming pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: stretched, but yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Techniques learn something every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about a super cropping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to super cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to explain?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've seen that on your channel
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to explain?
[SPEAKER_00]: What that is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep consistent and then I'll go with
your, uh, your definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super cropping is really just,
I guess you're, you're kind of breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: that outer layer of the plants,
you know, the, the what cell membrane or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to call it in and kind
of flop and making it, uh, flop over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally I typically do it when it's
during that three week stretch period and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having trouble controlling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm controlling the stretch or if I want
to kind of keep that canopy even in some
[SPEAKER_00]: sense, I'll go ahead and I'll,
um, just like you were doing it right
[SPEAKER_00]: there, kind of manipulating, uh,
that breaking off that outer layer and
[SPEAKER_00]: then flopping it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the things flop down,
it allows the lower branches to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: catch up and that thing will, you know,
it'll pop back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: That branch is going to pop back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's kind of a poor definition,
but that's kind of, that's really,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's really it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, if there is a tech,
technique that I follow the most,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's super cropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's exactly that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, uh, some, some may, might,
might argue that it's, it's just the main
[SPEAKER_02]: branch that you're super cropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and, and sure, if that's the
definition of super cropping would be the
[SPEAKER_02]: main branch, then sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly exercise that as well,
but the manipulation of the cell membrane
[SPEAKER_02]: and someone in the comments can tell us
what that there's a name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what it is, but anyways,
um, when you break that cell membrane,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it could be argued too,
that that is high stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that is, that is a practice that
I think needs to be utilized in the
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, or, or at least, um, if you want to
get the numbers to which that you're,
[SPEAKER_02]: that particular seed can, or that strain
can harvest, then super cropping is where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that the manipulation of the stem
is what seriously reinforces the
[SPEAKER_02]: structure, which then supports the flower
at the very end, the bigger, the stronger
[SPEAKER_02]: that stem is, the more, the more dense
the, like they go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got limp, loose, light stems,
you're going to have loose, light,
[SPEAKER_02]: limp flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's literally hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stronger the plant is in veg,
the stronger the plant's going to be in
[SPEAKER_02]: flower, uh, environment, uh, uh,
uh, excluded kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Variables excluded, but super cropping is,
is, is, is the technique that I'd like to
[SPEAKER_02]: utilize the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single day I come in the garden and
manipulate my, my, my plants during veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then less manipulation of it during
the stretch, more of just any time you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to bend the stem, you can't just come
into your flower room and just bend it
[SPEAKER_02]: over.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to manipulate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now how much you want that bent in
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want it to lay flat in most cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need it to come down in inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rather than to come flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So super cropping, great technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one I utilize almost the entirety
of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only utilize it when I need to kind
of create that even canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like low stretching isn't an
option anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because maybe it's like that center
branch in the middle and it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I can't really pull it down with the
other branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I'll super crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you saying you do super cropping in
order to strengthen the stems?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every bud, every stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I come, if, if you've watched a time
lapse on my video, all the, all the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: start or, or even a training, all the
plants start very high up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all very perky pointed towards the
light.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I will come in and,
and, and, and, you know, I'd say it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: a 60, 40 in terms of bending and twisting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want those like, once you bend those
main, when you start bending your plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to find very quickly that
there's going to be stronger ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger stems on the outside,
just, just through, through nature itself
[SPEAKER_02]: without the training.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to have weaker ones in
the middle, going through the middle,
[SPEAKER_02]: the middle branches is where I'm,
I'm, I'm exercising that technique the
[SPEAKER_02]: most to make sure that they're going to
keep up with the outer branches so that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have similar buds throughout
the entirety of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I think, yeah, I would say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so when do you start super cropping?
[SPEAKER_02]: The moment I'm going to make that first
bend.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it would, the moment I'm going to bend
it in veg would be the moment I start to
[SPEAKER_02]: super crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to start to manipulate that
stem, try to, I don't know if breaking is
[SPEAKER_02]: the right way to describe it all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, if super cropping is the technique of
breaking the stem, you know, you can hear
[SPEAKER_02]: it snapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I do that all the time,
but the idea of, you know, stretching that
[SPEAKER_02]: membrane and manipulating enough that it
falls over is, is more of the technique
[SPEAKER_02]: that I follow, but breaking it is just
another way of getting it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when do you stop it then?
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when's the last time you super crop
really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, like if it's going like it'll
be late veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause typically I've got, by the,
by the time I'm sending the flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've created the canopy that I'm,
that I'm happy with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I'm sending it to flower at that
point, when it comes to keeping the canopy
[SPEAKER_02]: even, it's more of just a light
manipulation of the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would, I would say it's still within
the first couple of weeks of a flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: still, still trying to make sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like I said, by the time you're
flowering your plant, your stems are
[SPEAKER_02]: really thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very heavy and, and, and,
and they've, they've almost built up like
[SPEAKER_02]: a, not a bark, but like just an outer
core.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were to come up to that,
that branch and just try to, to get it to
[SPEAKER_02]: go flat with the rest of the canopy,
it's going to snap in half and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to lose it without taping it back
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to have to kind of,
kind of rub it in your fingers just to get
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that, that bent, that stem to bend
down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first couple of weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a tutorial?
[SPEAKER_00]: A tutorial video on your channel that I
can link?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link that in the description section
below for, for everybody out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during that three week stretch for your
period in flower, you, you really don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: super copying.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say to the
extent that I am in veg every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because I'm hoping by the time I've
sent it to flower, all of the effects that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done in veg are enough that those
stems are, are, are, are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're tight, they're built,
they're robust, they're strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any, any bending that goes on in flower is
just merely to keep the canopy flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll even, you might even tie down still
in flower to make sure that it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I, no, I wouldn't say that I continue
super cropping in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As intense, as intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's as Canadian answer as you're going
to get right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I went both ways three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And arguably, I mean, somebody could,
could, is probably going to comment on
[SPEAKER_00]: this and say, you don't want to do any
sort of high stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: In flower, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can, but arguably any high
stress training taken away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your, your, your plant would then focusing
on the repair process instead of the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: formation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to avoid doing any type of high
stress training techniques like that or
[SPEAKER_00]: topping, um, in the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I do do it just to, um,
try to create that canopy even as like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to do what you got to do to
keep that canopy even, because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going to reward you in the long
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found I need to do it whenever I do
like a trellis and try to like do like a
[SPEAKER_00]: screw, the scrub technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I find like during that three
week stretch period in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I don't have the chance to bend down
it anymore to get under the netting
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll, you know, I'll super crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just another, another time I do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else on super cropping?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's another one of those techniques
as you're, it's very aggressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hands on these plants are
resilient and it's, it's almost,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's almost the most Abuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the right time is is, is going to
reward you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I think we've covered a lot in this
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, this was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much pigeons for coming
onto my channel and discussing training
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that this is a definitely some
good information again, for the people
[SPEAKER_00]: viewing this and I've got I've got
veterans that are viewing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different ways to do it
Just experiment and yeah, just try to have
[SPEAKER_00]: fun with it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the key have fun because there's
already enough stresses let alone the in
[SPEAKER_02]: the world There's enough stresses in the
garden that'll keep you preoccupied.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to we don't need to create
any more unnecessary stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun Relax and it's quite the
experience and anything that you
[SPEAKER_02]: experience through this grow is going to
seriously help you in the next grow So get
[SPEAKER_02]: your hands dirty and Chris I want to thank
you for having me as I said at the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning you're this this this form of
interview this kind of content is is a
[SPEAKER_02]: shining light for our community and I look
forward to seeing seeing what else and who
[SPEAKER_02]: else you can have Have over and and the
information you can pull from them much
[SPEAKER_02]: needed and I want to hear from I want to
hear from in the comments too You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether you agree or disagree.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your techniques?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like like I said, we've been here
for almost an hour 40 some minutes But
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like we haven't even scratched the
surface we haven't even scratched the
[SPEAKER_02]: surface in terms of of the techniques and
the numbers of ways of getting It done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So absolutely more content for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, and Yeah, another question for the
viewers is who would you like me to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of have a discussion with next,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked with Rob from CL TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got pigeons here I want to get more
growers involved in these types of
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations because there's just There's
so many different perceptions on ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to generate ideas for people,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: so let me know who you want to see on this
channel in the future and I will leave a
[SPEAKER_00]: link to pigeons channel down in the
description section below Thank you very
[SPEAKER_02]: much any final words No, thanks for having
me a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it and I look forward to
seeing the success of your channel and
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been it's been an honor Being being a
colleague of yours, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you coming on All
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks guys You You You
