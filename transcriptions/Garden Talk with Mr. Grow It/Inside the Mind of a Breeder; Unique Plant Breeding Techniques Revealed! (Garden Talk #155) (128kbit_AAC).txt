P. How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on to the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's going to be a fun talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk all about breeding,
and there are so many different ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aim breeding, reversing, backcrossing,
the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to dig in, pick your brain a
little bit, find out what you do,
[SPEAKER_01]: your style of breeding, and things that
kind of go along with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How the plants are grown throughout the
growth cycle, phenol hunting, all that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get too deep into it,
can you give us a little bit introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, hey, Skit P. Man, I got into
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it started way back as a shorty,
you know, really just watching my
[SPEAKER_00]: grandfather work in the garden and whatnot
that he had in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he grew these crazy tomatoes just all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, kind of inspired,
you know, and was always just driven to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of really, I guess, just produce my
own and create my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, as I am a creator,
I'm kind of all over the place from you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, a musician, you know, artist,
writer, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just that's my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said before we still hit the record
button, you've been gardening for about 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get into breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about how that came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when it comes to breeding,
you know, that was that was really the
[SPEAKER_00]: starting point for me, you know,
when I first wanted to dive into,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just the cultivation of the
medical plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wanted to create my own,
you know, I wanted the like the master
[SPEAKER_00]: strand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, well, this is good,
but I know it could be great if we take
[SPEAKER_00]: this and bring it with that and bring it
all together and it's gonna be amazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was that was really the driving
force, you know, that got me going and and
[SPEAKER_00]: really just, hey, where's the pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the females?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, let's make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that creativity turned not just
into gardening or breeding, but you also a
[SPEAKER_01]: movie producer and you put me in your
film.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm officially a movie star.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got Lionsgate hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Disney hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you do have a movie out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about your movie that you got
real quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the name of the film is designer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based a little bit, you know,
off my own experiences and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with a little bit of
embellishment, you know, for entertainment
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about a guy that's on a
journey, you know, to, hey, create the
[SPEAKER_00]: master string.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along this journey, it's a it's a bit
of a different events, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah, you know, we got you in it,
Mr. Growett, which was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we was able to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, been a long time viewing your
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really actually helped me in my
own personal journey of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just from where we're at,
you know, where I was and where I'm at
[SPEAKER_00]: now, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that was awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so stoked when you hit me up and you're
like, be in my movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what you told me about,
like the actual story of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's on Tubi so people can watch
it for free on Tubi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely available on Tubi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a few other platforms
that will be coming out in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, definitely looking to get it on
Prime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, definitely check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tubi is live, you know, tap in,
get the app right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats on all your success there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I mentioned, there are so many
different types of breeding you can do in
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding, reversing, back crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do for like what what's your
style of breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So forgive me for not having all the
formal terms and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really just my initial,
I guess, beginnings with the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it started really with the first
one was Midnight Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was that was the name of the
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was just a random seed that I
had lying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, it was a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, from there, I was just I
kind of just was crossing it with
[SPEAKER_00]: different ones, you know, visiting various
seed banks and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and just, you know, I was just just
crossing them, you know, until I got a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit further on, you know,
I became privy, you know, to some of your
[SPEAKER_00]: content and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know the feno hunting,
the back crossing and some of those topics
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was that was when I the first time
I implemented the back crossing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when I was just looking to try
to like just kind of he like hone in on
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the characteristics of pretty much
one in particular, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so you're mostly doing kind of the
inbreeding side of things you're taking
[SPEAKER_01]: one from one side mother father.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crossing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then are you working yourself down
generation to generation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kind of just sticking with the
f1s?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really just been sticking with the f1s
at this current time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, and I'm currently feno hunting
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this particular stage where I'm at,
I've been pretty much just crossing down
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, once I kind of back
crossed because I was running into some
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with it was actually I had some
Hermes in there where it was expressing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously that's going to be an issue
for, you know, depending on how you look
[SPEAKER_00]: at things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we definitely was looking to get that
out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the back crossing, it definitely
seemed to be the way to get it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just with the really just
like the one time and it was for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so how did you do that back cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you did that initial cross,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the offspring of that you planted your
finding Hermes and then you would you take
[SPEAKER_01]: one?
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't a Herm and kind of back
crossed it to the father.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what ended up happening was my
particular cross that I've been working
[SPEAKER_00]: with, it had some Hermes genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what ended up happening was I kind of
got lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a forbidden fruit and I got a female
and a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I got the male, I saved the
pollen, you know, I, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a bag, froze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to preserve it and pretty
much over time, what I ended up doing was
[SPEAKER_00]: after the initial cross, you know,
I ended up with the forbidden fruit pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had, I ended up crossing that back
into the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that next offspring, it appeared that
the Hermi gene that it was expressing
[SPEAKER_00]: previously was pretty much clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, talk to us about your favorite cross
that you've ever created.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, how many crosses have you
done roughly and what's your favorite one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say up to this point,
it was one of the ones I referenced to as
[SPEAKER_00]: a night cheddar, because after the initial
cross of the midnight Kush with the rando
[SPEAKER_00]: seed that I just had lying around,
I ended up crossing it with a blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just remember the terpene profile of
it was it was just something very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I actually due to the fact that
it was so early on and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the seeds for quite some time,
I never really, you know, I wish I was
[SPEAKER_00]: more into feno hunting back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I could say, because I
definitely missed that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, by the time I actually thought
about it, it was sitting around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of was already jumping down the
strain of I got to cross this one with
[SPEAKER_00]: that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still don't have it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it ended up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I try coming back around like later
in the years and whatnot, because I just
[SPEAKER_00]: been holding on to them, the seeds were
pretty much I couldn't get any of them
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a null and void, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on that cross, what was like the
flavors and smells and effects that you
[SPEAKER_01]: got out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just felt like how can I it was just
very like floaty, you know, nothing too
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy where it's going to be like the
couch lock effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if you got things to do,
you know, it was still, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just was more so like a even kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like a 50 50, you know,
I've never done any, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: formal testing or whatnot, but just going
off of like the overall effects of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was it was a very like balanced kind of
effect that, you know, garnered from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like hints of the cheese,
you know, but there was also remnants of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Midnight Kush, which I was very fond
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of gassy, you know,
it was elements of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a very nice blend from what I
can remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are your genetics available to the
community or do you just keep them
[SPEAKER_01]: internal?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, right now, you know, it's all
internal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, last thing I want to do is put
out some bad, you know, genetics of any
[SPEAKER_00]: kind or something that'll be cumbersome
to, you know, to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I really want to, you know,
get it to a point where it would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it would be very advantageous,
I would say, for a new beginner,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, grower to come into it and or to
a connoisseur can also like appreciate it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has some work to be done for
sure, for sure, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can take so long to get through
the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I started chill out OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only cross I've actually ever
done in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: So started and I released to the community
in twenty twenty three.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me kind of several years in order
to kind of really confident that what I
[SPEAKER_01]: had was going to be stable enough to where
I really weren't going to find any herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say many, I want to say none,
because like from my understanding,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still kind of always within its
genetics, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people will debate that fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, what I was finding
in the population, I wasn't really finding
[SPEAKER_01]: any hermaphrodite plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So got to the point where I was
comfortable to actually do the release.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it takes very, very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really got to have patience for it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people will just pollen chock
and then they'll create seeds and then
[SPEAKER_01]: push it out to the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without testing, that's a separate
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it seems like you're going about
it the right ethical way to where you
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't even released anything yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just kind of working things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think also, too, after
watching some of the content and listening
[SPEAKER_00]: in on on some of the discussions,
I was like, oh, I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't I can't have myself out there like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it's a lot of pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's like if you if you release
something, it's just a bunch of herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, look what happened to Humboldt
Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They released the Donuts Triploid,
and it's like a really, really high
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got exposed and it was just not a
good thing for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't I don't think they're selling
them anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their listing is still up, but it was a
catastrophe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's apparently there wasn't
enough testing done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they were just doing it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they got to indoors, that's I guess
where a lot of those problems were
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that environmental change,
you know, can definitely impact a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's good that you're patient
with things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you are doing female hunting,
right, when you're looking for that male,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're looking for that female,
there are different characteristics that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can look for talking about males in
particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you typically look for when
searching for males to breed with?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, the biggest thing is how fast
is it growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How well does it adapt to my environment?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and also to one thing I've
implemented as of late, I feel that more
[SPEAKER_00]: so a more mature male plant, at least from
my own experience doing the stem rub,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just to see the terpene,
because I feel like that adds to the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the things I feel like
when female hunting just in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is just looking for that that
terp profile that, you know, that essence,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I feel like that's why,
you know, people burn incense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that that experience is
everything, you know, well, at least a big
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the flavor, but you can't tell
that right there from the male,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but as far as the male goes,
yeah, that's the biggest thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, growth factors, how well it
thrives in my environment, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm going to be growing it
predominantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you know, the smell that I'm
getting from it, if any.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how about female plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you look for kind of the same things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there other characteristics that you
look for when searching for female plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the females is more so I'd say
like midway through, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of looking for certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, the smell that is putting out
the flower development, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the node separation, all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the fan leaf production,
as of recent, you know, it's been a big
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that I've been experiencing,
you know, just with implementing certain
[SPEAKER_00]: strains into the cross, it kind of like,
I don't I don't know if it would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation or it's just a overabundance of
that gene or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say, you know, but I know that's
huge, because if you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliate, you know, three, four times
throughout the process, maybe five,
[SPEAKER_00]: six, you know, some of them are just crazy
with family production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be a hindrance for some.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the morphology of the plant,
you're looking real deep into that and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of selecting from there, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all those characteristics,
you know, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, at that point, you know,
like midway through, at least it would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you're looking to breed and
whatnot and have something available,
[SPEAKER_00]: clone it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it looks any what, you know,
of something, you know, desire
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics that I'm seeking and then
from there, you know, obviously the effect
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, I would get from it,
you know, upon harvest, but which is why
[SPEAKER_00]: it's definitely, you know, you want to
clone it, you know, midway through if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: even looking of such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously you got the tricone
production and things of that nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if you're looking for like
extracts and whatnot, um, I've come
[SPEAKER_00]: across, you know, some interesting,
you know, strains out there where I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen just looking under the jeweler's
loop, the tricone production is very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just, uh, some are far more
prevalent than others, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I've seen them where they're looking
like they're almost like stacked on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned midway through you take
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking midway through veg period,
or are you going into flower and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, taking clones down the flower stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning the actual flower stage,
you know, um, in regards to the female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you know, uh, cause I know when we
speak on seeking characteristics for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, as far as a female is
concerned, you know, that's when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see like what we're really
getting granted structure and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the plan itself can always be
manipulated, you know, to the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, growth space, you know, using various
techniques and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's really not a big thing
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, I'm really seeking the overall
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, you know, really once again,
adaptability to the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, some are far more heavier
feeders and others, you know, and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I, sometimes I do like to maybe
grow one or two, at least two,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, different strains throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way when I harvest, you know,
I could have a different selection and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could kind of get used to,
uh, one plant, you know, so it's nice for
[SPEAKER_00]: a change up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're doing a lot of people call
monster cropping where you're basically
[SPEAKER_01]: just taking a clone and flower,
bringing it back, re-vegging it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then kind of working with from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, I've been doing that recently and
I've had past where I was taking clones
[SPEAKER_01]: within the veg stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, you can argue that it
takes a little bit longer to go through
[SPEAKER_01]: the re-veg process, but a lot of people
have the time, you know, if you're working
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants and finishing off the flowering
stage, you can bring that back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time you finish that harvest,
well, it's already re-vegging and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of working on it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So timing, I think it's kind of important
when it comes to on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think, uh, there's been times
where I've seen a plant and maybe I'll go
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead and, you know, um, kind of been let
down and whatnot, you know, eh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it smells good and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, oh, we need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time we get to actually
experiencing the effects of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very underwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just like, ah, you know,
so like you said, very time consuming,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when going through the process,
I think sometimes I could be overly
[SPEAKER_00]: patient, but Hey, you know, yeah,
I guess you can't rush perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get deeper into the actual growing
process when you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you are breeding, are you in soil,
cocoa, hydroponics or soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'll probably get ridiculed for
this cause I seen, um, different sides of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but I'm kind of using, I guess it
would be a bit of a three part,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's already a premixed soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just recently added like some cocoa
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of like broke it down and then I
have perlite where I don't know if it
[SPEAKER_00]: would still be defined as soil less or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people have referenced it,
uh, to it as, but, um, that's just my
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is just like the three part,
you know, it's very, uh, light,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, adding the extra cocoa in as
well with the perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, but yeah, soil nonetheless,
I know I'm getting into specifics and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let's get into specifics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was it like a brand of bagged soil
that you mix with the cocoa and what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio between soil and cocoa and perlite?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just say it's, um, just a three
part, you know, so one part soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: one part cocoa, and then one part perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say is, uh, earth's forest or
earth's floor or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the green bag that I think you could
probably find in every, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a garden store, you know, that's,
uh, in your local neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one to one to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what do you use for nutrients
throughout the growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you go about those feedings
throughout the growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have to name, uh, we talking name
brands or we just talking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the folks do like to have the
details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you don't want to reveal anything
by all means, it's more so cause I,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm gonna get lit up in the
comments with it, but I use, I use general
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics, honestly, cause it's the most
cost effective, but, um, I really just use
[SPEAKER_00]: their base veg, uh, you know, for veg,
I add the silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also supplement the cow mag,
the micro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I also throw some sugars in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I forget the name of it, but it's
pretty much at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a cane sugar base along with
some black strap molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, just the basic stuff,
you know, try to keep it basic,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of micro rising in there
throughout the process and just to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I assume you're following the general
hydroponics feeding chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing the full dose according to
what it says on the chart?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing a half dose or, or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in all honesty, I couldn't tell
you what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I just use the five milliliters,
you know, uh, of every single one that I
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I throw it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it all together, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call it the, uh, I think we call it
the swamp juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not mistaken, me and my buddy,
but, uh, you know, um, yeah, it just makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it all together, you know, five MLS each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's every other, you know,
uh, every other feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so pretty much give it the new one,
water it with just some sugar and then
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing the same type of ratios for
plants that you're growing for flower
[SPEAKER_01]: production, for example, versus a run
where you're creating seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people, what they're do is
they'll just stay on that veg ratio while
[SPEAKER_01]: they're creating seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the entire run for the whole flowering
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they swear that that helps with
healthier seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wondering if you did that technique
or do you just stick with what the feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: chart says for most flowering,
uh, parts where it basically knocks down
[SPEAKER_01]: the nitrogen and increases the phosphorus
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when, when we switch over to flower,
it's pretty much obviously I'm not feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: it the, the veg newts at that point,
which is pretty much, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: high in nitrogen and everything I switched
to the flower base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the major thing that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I guess the major difference,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, there will be at some
point, I say roughly maybe six to seven
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, I might up the dosing of the
phosphorus, you know, which is pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower base, you know, instead of from
five MLS to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I'd say it's usually about,
you know, two weeks, about a week and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half at that point, I'll just switch to
pretty much, you know, the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water and sugar, you know, and,
um, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really done anything known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I known for that to, I guess,
uh, help with any healthier seeds or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always just try to keep it as basic
as possible and, uh, and repeat,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and if I do try something,
it's always maybe a little bit here,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit there instead of just diving
into a knee deep, you know, got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've mostly just been doing, I have a
seated run, a breeding run where I've
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed a male and a female or pollinated
a female and it's creating seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have mostly just been following the
feeding chart where it does kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when you get to the flowering,
it's reducing the nitrogen, increasing the
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus and potassium, but this run in
particular actually working on F4
[SPEAKER_01]: generation of Chilidog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this run, I am kind of sticking with
the, what it says for week one flower
[SPEAKER_01]: where it kind of knocks back the nitrogen,
but not as much as it does later on in
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just sticking with that for the
entire flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've got a couple of weeks left
here until I harvest and the true telling
[SPEAKER_01]: will be once I dry and then crumble up the
flowers and see what does the seeds look
[SPEAKER_01]: like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any underdeveloped seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a percentage of developed seeds
versus underdeveloped seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm personally doing a little,
we're experimenting there when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrients and how I do my feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me ask you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find when you have a plant that has
seeds in it, it takes longer to mature or
[SPEAKER_00]: does that affect anything for you as far
as the development time?
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I push it further in order to try to get
more seeds developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like right now I could, if I was just
growing the females and just harvesting
[SPEAKER_01]: the buds, I'd be harvesting them right
now, but I'm going to push it additional
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks in order to try to get more seeds
out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am starting to see the fade on the
plant, like normal, normal senescence that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens towards the end of the growth
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keeping a close eye out for nanners to
potentially pop out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing so far, but yeah, I push it a
couple of weeks in order to try to get
[SPEAKER_01]: more, more yield of seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of folks do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a smart way to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just got to keep an eye on making sure
like, cause seeds will drop off the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like it continues to grow and calyx
open up and then the seeds drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a whole bunch of plants in
the same grow space, all the seeds are
[SPEAKER_01]: dropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might get mixed up on what's what.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want to go too long because
you're going to have all these seeds all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I definitely push it a little
bit longer than, than I normally would
[SPEAKER_01]: with just a female plant that hasn't been
pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into precision stress
techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people will do things to
stress the plant in order to try to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: better result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do any precision stress techniques
specifically when breeding or phenol
[SPEAKER_01]: hunting?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done a lot over the years,
you know, just trying different
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques, I guess you would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything from almost impaling
a pencil, you know, into the base of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, where it splits it out and you
know, cause it's supposed to create more
[SPEAKER_00]: tricone production and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amongst many of other just different
things, you know, that they put out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we've all gone through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one, the base that I stick to is
topping and LST.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep it basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to top relatively early to allow,
you know, those the stems that is created
[SPEAKER_00]: from the topping, you know, to really
develop, you know, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a base that can pretty much hold
up some heavy flowers, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also like in regards to the
LST, which is there's so many ways to go
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really just depends on like the
growth space and whatnot, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular, I like to kind of create
the branched out effect where you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, and then it kind of grows up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more tops, the more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely a yield guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get the most out of the harvest.
Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then within the growth space,
there are different environment conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can aim for temperature,
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people supplement CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about what environment
conditions that you aim for when breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely, so when breeding,
I would treat it just as any other
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering portion of the of the grow time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like to keep it, you know,
in between in between the spectrum of like
[SPEAKER_00]: 55, you know, 60 right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's the sweet spot for me,
at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as temperature,
you know, I in between 60 and 70 is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of peak, you know, I'm one that I'm a fan
of the purple color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, so I was just like to see
what the plant does in the cooler
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, you know, it's always pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when breeding, there are so many
different expressions that you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: amongst the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mutations happen every now and then,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you come across any mutations when
breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you refer to as a mutation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything from my duck's foot or is a long
list of ones, albino plants, anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, any funky growth that you've seen
could be twisted leaves, anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that at all or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can't say so much mutations
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the only thing I would reference to,
I guess, would be close to a mutation is a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that grows like it's been topped
just by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't stick to the the normal,
I guess, Christmas tree, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: type look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's very branchy, almost like if you
were to flip a grape, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a vine, the grapes pretty much upside
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how that would look, you know,
it does something along those very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but yeah, that would be the
closest to a mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would I would say I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I call that self-topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it just kind of splits off into
two different directions without you even
[SPEAKER_01]: even doing the topping, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel some of that is induced with
the LST method when you kind of expose the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower branches where they normally
wouldn't get, I guess they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: normally develop as they would,
you know, if you just let it do what it
[SPEAKER_00]: would do by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of it may be, you know,
my own doing, I guess, to some extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, some of them that I have
seen some plants that just grow like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one in particular, I want to say it
is might be from Herbie Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm not mistaken, is the Apple Betty's
and the rents punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say I seen kind of that's at
least what I experienced from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to pull up the list here of
potential mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got polyploid stringy Australian
bastard or ABC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a vine like there's creeper
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ducks would already mention leaf buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have buds, actually, that are on the
petiole between the petiole and the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf albino, which I talked about Ford
phylo taxi.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the quick list of mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also that double seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've ever come across.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some people come across it where
they plant a seed and then to sprout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that I've experienced that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the the bud in between the leaves,
you know, that sounds interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think that would just be cool to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually haven't come across that yet,
but I'm waiting and waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder what the odds are to come across
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, I don't know, one in 10,000 or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what that would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anybody knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comment below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, please, please let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, take a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are many challenges that you
could come across when breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some common challenges that you
face?
[SPEAKER_00]: Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I started, it was a very,
I guess, primitive concept of just growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in general, let alone breeding,
you know, given the information that was
[SPEAKER_00]: available to me versus, you know,
where we're at now, you know, is so
[SPEAKER_00]: readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of jealous of all the new growers
getting into the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they just got all this is just
it's just there for them, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, but as far as yeah, so a lot of
it is just, you know, knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that those are some of my own personal
obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not making the most of each of each grow,
you know, and that just kind of falls into
[SPEAKER_00]: the knowledge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not knowing up until I say about three,
four years ago, just feno hunting,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it finally dawned on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, whoa, so that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I found to be underwhelming,
the one or two seeds that I grew out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the batch and was like, oh, this is all
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I could have had something
amazing in that batch, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because now knowing like, OK, F1 versus
F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, and also to when you're implementing
certain genetics, even with just the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: banks, I'm seeing some now put this in
like the listings, but actually putting
[SPEAKER_00]: F1, F2, F3, which I really love,
you know, just the transparency because
[SPEAKER_00]: that could help with making a decision,
you know, just with, I guess, limiting the
[SPEAKER_00]: variables of what you may get,
you know, especially when you're seeking a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular like trait from what they're,
you know, putting in a description of that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's so many I could I could ramble
on all day for as far as obstacles that
[SPEAKER_00]: you may come across as breeding,
you know, because this yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's crazy how many different
phenotypes you can find within a batch of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, how many different expressions you
can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the phenol hunting part is
real fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned kind of knowledge is
being a challenge that you face.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with breeding in particular,
there's so much to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure, there's some information on the
Internet, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just do Google searches and and
learn how to do breeding there and learn
[SPEAKER_01]: the different terms and different ways to
go about it and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it might be valuable to purchase a
book.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are many books out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just bought the one by James Loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has one I'm reading and that's my my go
to as of right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that because he just released it,
I think this year, maybe 2024 or maybe he
[SPEAKER_01]: released in 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just got my hands on it this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very detailed book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you can just easily get to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could just go around my bookshelf
there, pick it out and then go back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: index if I'm looking for something in
particular or look by chapter and learn so
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I really recommend folks dig into
some of these books that are out there
[SPEAKER_01]: because again, sure, you can go ahead and
do Google searches on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately, there's a lot of mixed
information, missed misinformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be tougher, a little bit tougher to
navigate, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I could only see how the
knowledge can be a barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad you brought that one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about common misconceptions about
reading?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some things that you feel like
people say is one thing but is actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: misconception?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of falls into the knowledge
portion of it, which I mean, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that it was a misconception for me
was, hey, you take this OG and mix it with
[SPEAKER_00]: this sherb over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first, you know, when you try is
going to be amazing because you had two
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing plants and it's still a journey
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that right there,
I'd say one for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow, you know, what may grow good in
your environment may not be suitable for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for someone else's, you know,
the region that you're in, you may it may
[SPEAKER_00]: be more humidity or lack thereof.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so while this plant may thrive
with the cooler temperatures at night,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and some plants is not going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some while, you know,
just testing out genetics and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some thrive, you know, in the cool like
the colder temperatures and it just did
[SPEAKER_00]: some cool things, you know, with the
colors and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then others, the the harvest or,
you know, I guess if I could even call a
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, you know, it was underdeveloped
flower and everything else that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you were dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, those are some good ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the future of breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: What trends do you see in the future and
how might advances in genetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: technology shape the next generation of
strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I say, first of all,
is definitely the transparency and the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that's just out there right now is
going to help with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people that are aspiring,
you know, that aspiring breeders and may
[SPEAKER_00]: have like a goal in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as on the technology level,
I which I'd have to imagine are already
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've never worn a lab coat,
you know, or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know, you know, just from seeing how
they cross the plants and just the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables that we have every day,
you know, and really being able to hone in
[SPEAKER_00]: and just manipulate things like I'd have
to say, like maybe to the point with
[SPEAKER_00]: CRISPR, if you're familiar with that,
like some of that technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if they're, you know, able to hone
in on certain genes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: within us, I mean, obviously they could do
it with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have precision technology like
that, you know, you could do some amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'd have to say the the future is
really it's kind of endless, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or the possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there's gonna be a lot of
changes in the future for breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, tissue culture, that's becoming
more and more popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's becoming more and more accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Athena put out that tissue culture
kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a chance to try it myself,
but it seems like it makes things a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more easier for small home growers,
individuals to do tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I foresee people using that to kind of
store genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think also testing will kind of get a
lot better in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to test for resistance,
pathogens, diseases, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's going to be big in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's kind of hard to imagine that
whole CRISPR thing is nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a few documentaries on it and
seeing what they're doing with like
[SPEAKER_01]: humans, you know, and it was somebody in
China who did it for a birth or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wild to see what the future is like
for that and how that translates over to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think they reference to them as
designer babies, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure they got designer plants for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just, it's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of the things that you
touched on, I know just the technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think being readily available to the
home grower, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just to the average consumer,
you know, you would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of the testing that they have
like with being able to determine whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it's male or female, I know some things
like that, you know, available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I've never, you know,
used it, but you know, uh, cause at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point I'm, I'm kind of stuck in the stone
age with some of the things I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna just stick to what I know and
whatnot, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, you know, that's,
uh, that, that, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, accessibility is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, DNA sex testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually just sent out a bunch of
samples the other day and I'm waiting here
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: That service is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit off topic here, but,
uh, but that's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does that take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they receive the samples,
you're able to, they flip it and within a
[SPEAKER_01]: day or so they give you the result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so like, I have a seedlings that
just popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went ahead and snipped off the cotyledon
leaf of each one, sent those in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I should be able to identify what
the males are and kill them off before I
[SPEAKER_01]: hit day 14 of sprout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like that helps out a ton because
I'm not wasting time transplanting
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, watering, all that space,
all that stuff is saved because they may
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to kill off my males here and in
about a week, actually in a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: days, wouldn't be surprised if I got it
back on a Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on a Wednesday here and I shipped it
out on Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I should hopefully get a result
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that, that helps and actually
does relate to the whole breeding side of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's a tool that you can use in
order to kind of speed things up a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not just, if you're not,
if you're not looking for males or if you
[SPEAKER_01]: just want to segregate your males,
you want to identify what your males and
[SPEAKER_01]: females are and you can put them in
different spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it actually does relate to what
we're talking about here, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: really good service.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do use it often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna definitely, that's something I'm
gonna have to tap into for sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, cause while I've more so
kind of transitioned into the female
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting and just locking in, you know,
on this latest cross the mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, there's definitely something
in the future that will definitely speed
[SPEAKER_00]: up the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like you say, it's a lot of
resources lost, you know, with the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything else, you know,
the, all the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though they've, uh, I think the
energy bill is, you know, they've
[SPEAKER_00]: condensed on that, you know, and,
and helped out with the savings a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit with the led and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, cause man, you know, I started
off with the metal halide and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: HPL, uh, the HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been, honestly, it's really just been
collecting dust, you know, at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, since I transitioned to led it's
like, I can't go back while it helped out
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot on the heating aspect of things,
you know, if you didn't have a heater in
[SPEAKER_00]: the space and you had some cooler
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just buy a mini heater at this
point, you know, I think it, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it eats up more energy than anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a lot of beginners that tune
into this podcast where this podcast is
[SPEAKER_01]: for all experience levels, beginner,
intermediate, advanced, and the guests are
[SPEAKER_01]: also on all experience levels,
but we do have a lot of folks that are
[SPEAKER_01]: tuning in right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the beginners and they're just
getting started breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice do you have for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch garden talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just continue to tune into this podcast
and, uh, you'll learn everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, grab a book, obviously, you know,
do your research, you know, cross
[SPEAKER_00]: reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but really study study before just
diving into it, you know, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, save yourself, you know, a couple of
steps, you know, uh, that I could have
[SPEAKER_00]: saved, I guess, you know, uh, cause I
remember, I think I killed my first two
[SPEAKER_00]: times around or I've, you know,
I don't know if I could say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, we're talking about plants,
but, uh, you know, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, uh, my first two attempts did not
last.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, um, really just study,
you know, um, understand it, what,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is that you're, you know,
you're doing with this and what it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, cause everything is, you know,
is different, you know, uh, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: all the same, you know, you got some that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So study the strain, you know,
um, cause you, it oftentimes you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: just take a, you know, one size fit all
approach, you know, definitely some good
[SPEAKER_00]: advice there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's, uh, let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, everything and everything,
um, you know, you could find me at
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, uh,
or just go directly to another vision
[SPEAKER_00]: productions.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could find me there and,
um, you know, a definitely in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, just search up skit P
and other vision productions and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and you'll find me in the rest of the
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have a link to your
Instagram down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_01]: section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So folks that are tuning in on YouTube can
click on the description section and click
[SPEAKER_01]: a link right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go ahead and give him a follow if you
are looking to follow his breeding journey
[SPEAKER_01]: and then also follow up on his movies and
productions that he's doing that movie I
[SPEAKER_01]: was in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people will like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, you know, stoner comedy,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's the audience here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did it for the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to the folks in the producer
tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, skip Pete, thanks so much for coming
onto the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you chopping it up and kind
of breaking it down for us kind of how you
[SPEAKER_01]: go about breeding and how you do the grow
and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks so much and hope you enjoy the
rest of your day.
