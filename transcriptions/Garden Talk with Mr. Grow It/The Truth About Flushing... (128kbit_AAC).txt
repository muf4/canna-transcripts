[SPEAKER_00]: They said within the study that not using
nutrients for the last 14 days resulted in
[SPEAKER_00]: no difference in yield, potency,
terpenes, mineral content
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and I'm back with another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time seeing my face,
I would love to have you stick around and
[SPEAKER_00]: subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my garden talk channel to where I
mostly do discussion videos, topic videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have some grow-like test videos on
this channel as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a separate channel,
which is my main YouTube channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I show off my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just get right into today's video.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably going to be my most
disliked video.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why is because this topic is
highly debatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the end of this video, you should
know some of the truth behind whether or
[SPEAKER_00]: not flushing is actually beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I'm talking about flushing,
I'm not talking about flushing mid-grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll have to flush mid-grow
depending on if you're using synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have overfed your plants and you
need to flush out some of those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you have a salt buildup and you need
to flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your pH is off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people flush because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about flushing mid-grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm specifically talking about the flush
that happens at the end of the grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when your plants are almost ready for
harvest, some grows will do what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: a 14-day flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, not everybody sticks to that 14-day
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do 10 days, 7 days,
5 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got some people who don't
actually flush their plants at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are various opinions and people
have their own reasons for why they like
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a flush at the end of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things I've heard about is
flushing to reduce the amount of nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in the soil and also in the plant
so that the overall final product has a
[SPEAKER_00]: good taste, smell, and the ash when
smoking is more white instead of a gray or
[SPEAKER_00]: black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say that flushing reduces the
harshness in the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also heard that flushing increases
terpene content, THC content.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many, many reasons why people
flush their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up until now, there hasn't really been
any scientific studies on this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video, I'm going to talk about
a recent scientific study that was done on
[SPEAKER_00]: the flushing process at the end of the
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got a ton of data and shows
whether or not flushing is beneficial or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, this study actually came out
several months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not brand new information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you watching this probably already
came across this study, but I know a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of my audience is new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty sure a lot of this
information is going to be new to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: my audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this particular study was done by
RxGreen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got some notes over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see my eyes shift over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just referring to the notes that I
have according to the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that what I'm saying
here accurately reflects what is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm also going to have a link down in
the description section below to a
[SPEAKER_00]: webpage, which goes over the study
entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what exactly did they do in this study?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they use the strain cherry diesel for
this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use their own nutrients and the
plants were grown in cocoa coir and they
[SPEAKER_00]: did four different flushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a 14 day flush, they did a 10 day
flush, a 7 day flush and zero day flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each flushing period had 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had 12 plants that did a 14 day
flush, 12 plants that did a 10 day flush,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 plants that did a 7 day flush and then
12 plants that day didn't flush at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower and fan leaf samples were collected
from each flushing treatment on the first
[SPEAKER_00]: day of flush and the day before harvest to
quantify concentrations of essential plant
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: After harvest, the plants were cured
before determining final trimmed flower
[SPEAKER_00]: weight, terpenes, and THC concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even took the trim from those plants
and evaluated that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They evaluated the trim for THC,
yield, and the appearance of the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: To determine smoking flavor and
characteristics, samples of each flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: period were distributed to cannabis
industry experts in a blind taste test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know where I sign up for this
blind taste test because it sounds like a
[SPEAKER_00]: cool job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each participant received one sample of
each flushing time without knowledge of
[SPEAKER_00]: its treatment, participants were asked
about their personal flavor preferences
[SPEAKER_00]: before tasting, after tasting participants
were asked to rate the sample of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, harshness of smoke, and the color
of the ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data collected during the course of the
trial were analyzed statistically to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine whether flushing times affected
smoking quality, flower weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: or the chemical characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the materials and methods
used for this study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about what their results
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they mentioned in the study,
visual differences in fan leaves between
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing times were apparent the day
before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants flushed for 10 or 14 days had
leaves that were more yellow, necrotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: and dry than plants flushed for zero or
seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color of the 14 and 10 day flushed
leaves indicated greater breakdown of
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll in the plant, leading to
reduced greenness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That right there is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I want to discuss at
the end of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that, well yeah,
I'll just save it till the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for yield, THC, and terpenes,
overall there were no significant
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between treatments for flower
weight, THC, or terpene content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the charts showing the average
weight per plant, average THC percent,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the dominant terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also took flower samples taken the
day before harvest and analyzed it for the
[SPEAKER_00]: content of essential plant nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things I mentioned
during the introduction as a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: say that flushing your plant, you flush
out those nutrients from the medium and
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of them that contributes to
a greater smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They state, overall there was no
significant change in the mineral content
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower as a result of different
flushing treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the charts which show the
nutrients of flower concentration percent
[SPEAKER_00]: for 14 day flush, 10 day flush,
7 day flush, and plants that weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: flushed at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extraction results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trim from the cherry diesel was sent to an
extractor to determine extraction yield
[SPEAKER_00]: and prefer characteristics of the wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants flushed for 14 or 10 days had the
highest extraction yield compared to the 7
[SPEAKER_00]: or 0 day flushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the appearance of the wax for the
0 day flush was preferred over the other
[SPEAKER_00]: flush periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 0 day flush was the clearest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they conclude on this part is,
although increased flush times resulted in
[SPEAKER_00]: higher extraction yields, the finished
product was not as desirable for
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember, this is a commercial
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself am a home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to wax, the clarity of the
product, for me, personally, I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be upset if one thing of wax is a
little bit darker than the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on a commercial side of things,
it is something that apparently they look
[SPEAKER_00]: very closely at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the taste and smoke
characteristics of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cured flower was evaluated by a
group of industry experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be interesting to know who these
industry experts actually are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't mention it in the study,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they evaluated for flavor and smoking
characteristics in a blind taste test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, the duration of the flushing
period had no impact on flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoothness of smoke, or color of ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 7 day flush period had the highest bad
rating, and the 0 day flush had the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest great rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most panelists rated the flavor of the
samples as okay or good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 10 day flush had the highest okay
ratings, and the 0 day flush had the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest good ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most panelists rated the samples as either
earthy or sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't actually say how many
panelists there were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there two people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there four people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there 10 people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely think that was some important
information that should have been said
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taste test panelists rated the ash color
and smoke quality of each sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ash color was predominantly black or gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoothness of smoke increased with
decreased flushing time, although it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't significantly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read their overall conclusion
word by word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to miss anything on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a first of its kind study, RxScreen
Technologies evaluated the effects of a
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing period on yield, potency,
terpenes, mineral content, and taste
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics of MJ Flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, the length of the flushing period
did not impact yield, potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, or taste characteristics of MJ
Flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taste test results indicated a trend
towards improved flavor and smoke quality
[SPEAKER_00]: with the 0 day flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there were no significant
differences in nutrient content,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a trend towards increased iron
and zinc in flour flush for 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results of this trial indicate that
there is no benefit to flushing MJ Flour
[SPEAKER_00]: for improved taste or consumer experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that is what they put in their
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are my thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the very end of the study,
the last sentence that they put here is
[SPEAKER_00]: the results of this trial indicate that
there is no benefit for improved taste or
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, improved taste, consumer experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're talking about flushing as a
whole, they did list off some benefits in
[SPEAKER_00]: their study, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They said within the study that not using
nutrients for the last 14 days resulted in
[SPEAKER_00]: no difference in yield, potency,
terpenes, mineral content, and taste
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then why use nutrients for the past 14
days?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not feeding the plant for the
last 14 days, well, then you're saving
[SPEAKER_00]: money on nutrients, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you save time by not mixing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know in a commercial facility,
they have different processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably well streamlined here for me
as a home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixing nutrients definitely takes a little
bit of time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some synthetic nutrient lineups
that have three bottles that you mix in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some have up to 10 bottles that you
mix in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mixing all those bottles within water
and then giving it to the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely time consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing that versus just watering,
well, you're definitely saving time with
[SPEAKER_00]: just watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like they said, not feeding nutrients
had no impact on yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the arguments that I hear
pretty often is if you're not feeding the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant all the way up to the end,
then those last couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're potentially losing yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: The study proved otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about the harshness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know what is the humidity or
the moisture content within the buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: As home growers, one thing that we hear
pretty often is that if your hygrometer is
[SPEAKER_00]: around 62% within the jars, then the buds
are at the ideal level for consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the commercial side of things,
they don't measure that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my understanding, they use a moisture
meter and they actually stick it within
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud to find out what the moisture
content is within the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know too much about the process,
so if anybody works in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facility and can explain more,
please let us know down in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, the drier the sample,
the more harsh it is going to be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was around 62% RH in the jar with
the buds, that's going to be a lot less
[SPEAKER_00]: harsh than something that's more dry,
40%, 30% RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely a contributing factor to
harshness on the throat when smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to know what the samples,
what the moisture content was or what the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity was in the jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they were sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is how long did they cure
the buds for before they consume them?
[SPEAKER_00]: On the homegrown side of things,
we dry our plants, then it goes into the
[SPEAKER_00]: curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, oftentimes I hear that you want to do
at least two weeks in the curing process
[SPEAKER_00]: before you smoke the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even at that point, I feel like I can
still taste some of the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally wait until 30 days into
curing before I consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even at that point, I can still taste
some of the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to Leafly, it takes six months
to a year in order for those buds to have
[SPEAKER_00]: the true taste and smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long they cure for is definitely a
contributing factor to harshness,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that they
highlighted in the study, which I said I
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to refer back to at the end,
was the color of the 14 and 10 day flushed
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves indicate a greater breakdown of
chlorophyll in the plant, leading to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced greenness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to know, was it a faster cure
for the plants that were flushed 14 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 days versus the plants that had a zero
day flush, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the main reason why I flush
my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the chlorophyll breakdown process is
happening while the plant is still alive
[SPEAKER_00]: and you harvest the plant where it's
mostly the yellow leaves, that should be a
[SPEAKER_00]: faster cure than if you would harvest the
plant with all green leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing I really think that if
they included the chlorophyll breakdown,
[SPEAKER_00]: they had that sort of measurement within
the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of would have been the icing on
the cake, but they didn't measure the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll amount during curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to save that for another study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that I think it's
awesome that they did the study and that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're sharing the results with the
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't think that we can truly
conclude that flushing has zero benefit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do think that this study is
absolutely a step in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to RX Green Technologies for
doing the study and sharing with all of
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know in the comments section
below, what are some of the reasons that
[SPEAKER_00]: you heard to flush at the end of the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about this study?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you currently flush at the end of the
grow, after hearing this information,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you going to continue to flush or are
you not going to flush anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally love to read studies about
this, so if any of you have any links to
[SPEAKER_00]: any studies that have been done,
it doesn't have to be about flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be about any grow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please link them down in the description
section below and maybe I'll make a video
[SPEAKER_00]: on it in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it, please click that
thumbs up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
