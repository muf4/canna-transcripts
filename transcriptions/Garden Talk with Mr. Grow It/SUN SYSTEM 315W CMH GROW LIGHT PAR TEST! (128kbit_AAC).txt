[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
love me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 315 watt CMH grow light kit and
includes the Sun System 315 Neutron CMH
[SPEAKER_00]: Reflector, Philips Master Color 315 Watt
3100 Kelvin Bulb, and Prism Lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: Science 315 Watt Ballast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link this kit in the description
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video I'm not going to go over
into the features or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to do a PAR test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use the Apogee MQ500 PAR meter,
measurements are taken in PPFD,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this meter measures 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers plus or minus 5 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any light is being emitted that is
outside that range, it won't show up on
[SPEAKER_00]: this PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just to give you a general
idea of what the PAR output is for this
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't going to be 100% accurate,
I'm taking measurements in a grow tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: the reflective walls could increase these
numbers, so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This light has a flowering coverage area,
of 3 foot by 3 foot, and I have it in a 4
[SPEAKER_00]: foot by 4 foot grow tent, so I'm actually
not going to bring this sensor all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: to the corner of the grow tent,
I'll try to keep it in a 3 foot by 3 foot
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take three different measurements,
12 inches away, 24 inches away,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 36 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: These seem to be the most common light
distances for CMH grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like all the other PAR test videos I
do, I'll let the measurements do the
[SPEAKER_00]: talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know by leaving a comment below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I have provided a link to this
grow light in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below so you can learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys,
if you enjoyed it please click that thumbs
[SPEAKER_00]: up, and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and until next time, peace.
