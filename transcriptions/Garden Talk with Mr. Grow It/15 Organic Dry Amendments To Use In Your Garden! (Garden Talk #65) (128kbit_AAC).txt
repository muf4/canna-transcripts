[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bone meal breaks down a little slower
compared to fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to add for bloom,
flower, getting the fruit, blood meal is
[SPEAKER_00]: one you want to add kind of in that
transition over from your veg into the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beneficial, but it's really helping
more the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say it's helping the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see an improvement in the
terpenes to me when I used the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have protozoa or the other
biology that help eat the bacteria and
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, your nutrients are being locked up
and stored up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not being helpful to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micromatricot nutrients are very important
because without this, we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: certain balances happening within the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't stay in a homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're low on something, it's going to
cause them to start reacting differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode number 65.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Medically
Fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on this podcast once before,
episode 13, and he talked all about
[SPEAKER_01]: organic dry amendments that you can use in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That episode currently has over 73,000
plays, and there were many comments left
[SPEAKER_01]: on that episode from people requesting a
part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this episode, we continue where we
left off and go over some more organic dry
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments that you can use in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by
going to patreon.com slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_01]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big supporter of this podcast is AC
Infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sponsor this podcast and I use their

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Medically Fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got off work and had to rush home to
kind of get ready for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you are back for a second time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure a lot of people recognize you
from the first time around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was way back in episode 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually released May 8th,
2021, and that episode has over 73,000
[SPEAKER_01]: views.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there was a ton of people in the
comment section demanding a part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted you back for a part two,
so you are actually the first reoccurring
[SPEAKER_01]: guest on this podcast to do a part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so last time around, we talked about
pretty much like dry amendments that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can use in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered, I have a list here,
gypsum, azomite, rock phosphate,
[SPEAKER_01]: and langomonite, dolomite lime,
oyster shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about how to brew teas,
green sand, humic acids, bio-live,
[SPEAKER_01]: and bokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those tuning into this episode
right now, you do not need to go back and
[SPEAKER_01]: watch that episode first.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can definitely still continue to tune
into this episode, but I'll definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: have a link to that past episode in the
YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe after this video, you can tune in
on that video and see some additional
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments that you can use in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or for you that's already seen it,
here's part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're going to continue to talk
about the organic dry amendments to use in
[SPEAKER_01]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those that don't know who you are,
can you do a quick introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I am a living soil cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been cultivating since mid-2000,
2010, 11-ish, when I lived out in Las
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas, Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ever since then, I have continued to
kind of research and want to know more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more about the plant and about the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at it being like a symbiotic
relationship of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to know more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it set me on my journey and my
YouTube kind of video creation of just
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out videos for like video logs for
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned into more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's pick up where we left off talking
about the various amendments or organic
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the benefits and how do you apply
it to your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: So alfalfa meal is basically the
by-product of them breaking down alfalfa
[SPEAKER_00]: for either feed or essential oil extracts,
fatty extracts, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can use it for is to kind of
feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has plenty of the NPKs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some micro macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has a hormone called tricanthinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tricanthinol is really a plant growth
regulator or plant growth hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps the plant finish a little faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with some of the root expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But alfalfa, it kind of helps with the
soil amendment, building the biology that
[SPEAKER_00]: they like to break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with some protozoa, especially if
you do it in a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So alfalfa meal is really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use it throughout my whole grow,
feeding my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when my plants are going into fruit
flower stage, sometimes I bump it up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more, trying to help them ripen
a little faster, finish up a little
[SPEAKER_00]: faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about the tricanthinol seems to
help them do that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can say harvest my tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit quicker than,
say, the 45, 50 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might be able to do it a little sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the application rate for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Application rate is like a tablespoon per
gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're doing a top dress,
sometimes you have a five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you probably use a couple tablespoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making a super soil,
depends on the cubic foot, because then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking a couple cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make it into three and a half to
six cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make it into a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down to Earth likes to state that you
can't make teas out of their products,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks down over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can extract and make teas with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's three different ways you could
really apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually do a foliar spray if you
wanted to and apply it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually mixed in some alfalfa with my
Fox Farm Ocean Forest Soil, so the bagged
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's already, quote, hot soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's already got tons of amendments in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of people were surprised that
I added in alfalfa with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually added in alfalfa and insect
frass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get into insect frass here in a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got some really, really good results
off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just the veg stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did hear that alfalfa in particular,
somebody had mentioned that you should
[SPEAKER_01]: avoid using it in flour for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that just bro science?
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I understand, it's bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a problem using alfalfa in
my flour stage ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've used it 10 plus years more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highly talk about it in a lot of the
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: About using alfalfa and trichanthinol,
especially in flour, to help them finish
[SPEAKER_00]: up quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a living soil bed, my plants seem to
really start finishing anywhere around day
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 to 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: 63, to me, it's almost going over the
point I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of what that does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what trichanthinol as a plant growth
regulator kind of helps the plant do,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's supposed to help it finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to ripen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people here, plant growth
regulators or PGRs, and they kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: they proceed with caution, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is a PGR out there that is
known as a carcinogen, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's the one thing,
the difference between organic and other
[SPEAKER_00]: products that are chemically changed to
get that hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: With organics, most of these are natural
plant, like cytokines and oxens and
[SPEAKER_00]: trichanthinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: These all happen within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all organically part of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not much you can do to get away
from them using these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not in the sense like,
hey, I'm going out and I'm finding this
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of this plant growth regulator to
help my plant just do all this crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not the purpose of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to bat guano.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something that's very commonly
used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a ton of different guanos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bat guano, in particular, seems to be very
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that it's high in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about bat guano,
kind of what it is, the benefits,
[SPEAKER_01]: application rates, so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have bat guano and you have c
guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them are high in nitrogen and
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bat guano, you're looking at it as the bat
is more of an herbivore eating small
[SPEAKER_00]: insects and bugs compared to like
seabirds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seabirds, they can eat different,
like not just small, they'll eat fish,
[SPEAKER_00]: different insects, sometimes small
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on the seabird.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bat guano, a lot of people look
for it to use a lot in the flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: helping with soil biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with the soil biology because
they like the guanos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like the frass, the poop,
the manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manures are higher in nitrogen,
higher in phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where a lot of people like
those, especially in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't use a lot of guanos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always felt that they've gave my
plant kind of an odd taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't sure if it was the guano
itself or the cure method.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I took it out of like my super
soil recipe, I don't get that same taste
[SPEAKER_00]: that I used to get using guanos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people do, some people don't use
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on your preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And down to earth, they have one,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, they have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something like a 731.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about blood meal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood meal, if you're vegan or vegan,
you don't want to use blood meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made by animal byproducts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blood meal is fast acting, like an amino
acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acid type nitrogen that if you're top
feeding your plants or making it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: tea, it's going to help your plants take
up nitrogen a little faster compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: say like feather meal, where it's a slower
breaking down amendment versus the blood
[SPEAKER_00]: meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I put blood meal in my pot,
I can expect within a week to two weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty well broken down into the soil
and the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to break it down,
allowing the plant to uptake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some solubility to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you do put it with water or top
dress and add water, some of it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get released right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your plants can utilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, it's one of the things that I
do use, especially in my veg state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craig, if I'm wrong, but this is one of
the amendments where there's quite a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of controversy around it as far as people
talk about organic, organic amendments and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like, well, blood meal isn't
organic because of the source and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, what were the animals fed and so on
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's my response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's organic chemistry when it
breaks down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's organic in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's carbon based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these amendments that are carbon based
and all of these are carbon based and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of a source of nutrients our
plants need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that versus, hey, it's came from a
cow and it was slaughtered and it went
[SPEAKER_00]: through this whole horrible process just
to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the cow is going to be slaughtered
anyhow for the butcher to produce meat for
[SPEAKER_00]: people that want to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some of the byproducts that
they're just going to throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of it sitting there
decomposing, bringing in bad pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using it and breaking it down and
making it into an amendment or something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can use to top dress your soil
and help condition your soil because the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, they love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really like what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps them with getting that
ready to be taken up by the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bone meal is next on the list and I got to
imagine there's some similarities between
[SPEAKER_01]: blood meal and bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about bone meal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple of different types of
bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have bone meal, then you have fish
bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them are pretty high in
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of them that I really enjoy
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bone meal breaks down a little slower,
like a slower release phosphorus compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great deal that if you're going
to add for bloom, flower, getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit, bone meal is one you want to add
kind of in that transition over from your
[SPEAKER_00]: veg into your flower and into the flower
state because plants are really looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really a good source for them
to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, to me, a nice organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other amendments you can use still
for phosphorus, but bone meal or fish
[SPEAKER_00]: meal, I think what the biology in the
soil, how it helps them beneficially is
[SPEAKER_00]: the reaction I'm looking for and not so
much that, oh, it's derived from a fish or
[SPEAKER_00]: it's derived from an animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, from bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bone meal is more that phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have some nitrogen to it,
but it's more that phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when your plants are producing
the fruits, flowers, and they're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for that phosphorus and not just
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where adding that to me,
like in that transition from veg over in
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower state and then into flower
first couple of weeks is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much, I mean, plants like
phosphorus for helping with rooting and
[SPEAKER_00]: other growth, but to me it's not crucial
where you're looking for certain flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: to develop and be dense and full.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like certain points of a plant's
growth in their life cycle, you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to hit certain nutrients, trying to help
with that so they get a better production
[SPEAKER_00]: during that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the tomato wanting to
produce more tomato spots or starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I mean by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: More sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I learned is that phosphorus,
you know, you hear about it being uptaken
[SPEAKER_01]: and flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually part of the biomass,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those actual flowers are mostly
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about cottonseed meal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cottonseed meal, it's derived kind of
like alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a by-product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some trace minerals to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit, but it's mainly like
protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And proteins are what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Amino acids when they're broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where I'm looking at it
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to add for the soil conditioning
to help build the soil biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant use, it's like the amino acids that
plants are looking for to help like the
[SPEAKER_00]: building blocks of leaf tissue and cell
development and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do the plants actually uptake the
amino acids?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the biology really helps
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants still take up amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Ketalife makes a product called Green
9, which is an amino acid nitrogen complex
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will take up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just add it in water and water it in or
even top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cottonseed meal, similar to that,
it's not so soluble like this powder form,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Green 9, but once the water hits it
and the biology kind of breaks it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to make it plant available in
amino acid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is it safe to use throughout the
entire grow or should you only use it in
[SPEAKER_01]: veg or only use it in flour, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use it through veg and partial
flour like the beginning stages and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of wean off because your plants don't seem
to use, in my opinion, the amount of amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acids laid in flour as they do during
flour development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to crab meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is crab meal and what are the
benefits of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So crab meal, similar to like what oyster
shell is, it's the crust up like outer
[SPEAKER_00]: shells of crab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like chitinase, chitin,
in a sense, how do I want to describe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the oyster shell has a lot of like
calcium to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be similar,
but crab is similar to like crustacean
[SPEAKER_00]: meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both help with the salicylic,
jasmonic kind of part of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the self-defense mechanism because the
chitinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great for calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when your plant's looking for calcium
uptake, especially during bloom,
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, fruit production, that's really
when it's going to be kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial, getting more calcium into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to kind of mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harder to make it into a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes way too long to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like anything that's like a calcium,
a crust, a shell, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's going to take a while to break
down, similar to what egg is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a lot of people use egg,
for example, and like compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you're doing the whole shell,
it takes a while for all that calcium to
[SPEAKER_00]: be broken down in the biology to actually
break it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar with crab meal, crustacean
meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the application rate for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine that like a lot of these
products, I think a lot of folks are used
[SPEAKER_01]: to bottled nutrients and having to do like
a half dose, for example, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these organic amendments, I believe,
correct me if I'm wrong, that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: generally go by what it says on the
instructions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true or false?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason being is they all break down a
little differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're doing bottled nutrients,
it's readily evasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's readily available right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: With adding dry organic amendments,
it takes while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biology actually has to break a lot of
it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the percentage on some of these
products are like two to 3% soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 90 some percent is insoluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I'm taking a tablespoon per
gallon, which is five milliliters,
[SPEAKER_00]: for a bottle, it's still pretty much the
same ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just in a dry form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have to try to figure out how to
make it spread evenly where when you mix
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer up in water, you can mix it a
little bit evenly through the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not the soil compared to a dry
amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the application to me would be pretty
spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes depending on the nitrogen,
the nitrogen source, I think it could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think blood meal, if you're adding that
with other nitrogen sources, you might
[SPEAKER_00]: back off just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can create a toxicity to it,
especially if you're say using like neem
[SPEAKER_00]: seed meal and kelp and oyster shell,
other things that are higher in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then to me, you're gonna really create a
toxicity because your nitrogen levels are
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they're in different amendment
sources, it's still gonna be high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, when you're adding several
different sources of nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, I would consider backing off as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one last thing on crab meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned earlier defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with defense mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you said something like that,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question in regards to that would
be, I think a lot of people's ears perk up
[SPEAKER_01]: because one of the things that plants
produce as a defense mechanism is
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does crab meal, you know, this may be a
dumb question, but does crab meal help
[SPEAKER_01]: with trichome production in that sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the plant does is trichomes are
like part of the secondary metabolite
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your salicylic, your jasmonic,
pathways are some of the stressor pathways
[SPEAKER_00]: that when the plant's being attacked by a
pathogen kind of triggers these pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these pathways are kind of also
releasing these smells like terpenoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids that actually will help protect
it either causing the plant to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed out causing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So see trichomes are resonance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as like a plant, a bug walks on it,
it will start to stick to it and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: trap itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, if the plant's sick,
it's going to be attacked anyhow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant's stressed, that's when
it's producing the trichomes, the
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it's really, they're talking
it's more active and why it produces more
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you create stressors,
overwatering, underwatering, changing,
[SPEAKER_00]: your temperatures, I mean, low
environmental stressors can help with
[SPEAKER_00]: production of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And crab meal has chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that itself helps with those
metabolites and helps to build kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: those trichomes, the secondary stressors
that the plant's looking for to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next on the list is crustacean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's going to be similar to crab,
just a little different type of crustacean
[SPEAKER_00]: sea animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have a little bit of
nitrogen to it, a little like minor
[SPEAKER_00]: micro-macro type nutrients to some of it,
but it's still going to have chitinates,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing as crab and kind of insect
frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help with the secondary
metabolites in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using that to help in the soil pre,
I don't believe in top dressing in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they take way too long to top
dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe if you're going to do it,
you maybe scratch it in or kind of try to
[SPEAKER_00]: blend it in a little bit in the top part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the biology really gets all over it to
help break it down sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But adding it to like a tea or something,
there's not a lot of solubility to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you really are utilizing crab
crustacean meal, even oyster shell,
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend doing it in the soil,
like a super soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'd probably be beneficial for
those folks that are reusing soil over and
[SPEAKER_01]: over again, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it doesn't break down in the
current growth cycle, well, next growth
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle, it's still in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still breaking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think some of these things that you
mentioned that take a long time to break
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you're reusing your soil over and
over again, then it's certainly a benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: to use these longer breakdown ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil conditioning, and that's what it's
doing, helping condition the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: helping the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giving them a surface area to kind of
live off of as they're breaking it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: building the colonies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that I really enjoy about
using like crab meal, crustacean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was actually a question in the
comments section on the last video we did,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I want to bring it up to you here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, do plants benefit much
from the added fatty acids in crustacean
[SPEAKER_01]: meal?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I, I'm understanding is
that's a yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason being is because plants
produce fat lipids, biologies,
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to break down fats, doing your
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're adding such things as avocado,
that's fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love the fats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you got to understand,
like you can't just don't grease fat from
[SPEAKER_00]: your, some of your animals you're cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it could be beneficial in small
doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they might enjoy it,
but foods that are kind of naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: fatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biology really go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to give my plants dairy cream or do
it in my compost, which is a fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of fat content to it,
but it's also the lactose, the sugars
[SPEAKER_00]: that's with it that they enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving right down the list here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in alphabetical order for those
of you who haven't caught on just yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feather meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about feather meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feather meal is awesome for long-term use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to build a soil that's
going to go five, six, seven months,
[SPEAKER_00]: adding something like feather meal to it
will help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a slow releasing nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's going to take its time
breaking down and making it available for
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's going to go longer in your
soil than most your blood meals or knee
[SPEAKER_00]: meals, other sources of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to, it's going to be there a
little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biology love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps condition the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be, so I would mainly try to
focus it to not work so much during the
[SPEAKER_00]: veg state, but as I'm getting into flower
and laid in the flower, that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping that the feather meal is going to
last that long because I like to do bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: pots, get a bigger root base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my plants could veg a little longer
before I start fruiting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want the bigger the root,
the bigger the fruit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can get a basket of tomatoes versus
just a handful, I think I'm going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: the basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I let my plants veg a little longer,
so they get a little bit bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: then as they move in the flower,
that's what I'm hoping that feather meal
[SPEAKER_00]: at last I get in the flower because my
plants still need nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's your flowers, your produce,
it still needs nitrogen to produce and do
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell division and everything else that
it needs to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one of the common
misconceptions out there is that plants
[SPEAKER_01]: don't need nitrogen in flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear about, oh, it's heavy in nitrogen
for the veg stage, but when the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: stage, you don't need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's completely false, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they need some form of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may need more potassium and
phosphorus in flowering, but they also
[SPEAKER_01]: still need nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like nitrogen just completely
falls off the map on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still uptake nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe it or not, even into late
flower, plants are still looking for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about fish hydrolysate?
[SPEAKER_00]: So fish hydrolysate, it's kind of like,
it's a processed hydrolysate, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost like a fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most hydrolysates are a type of like a
fatty acid in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way the amino acids and the kind
of like the fatty acids are processed down
[SPEAKER_00]: and made into these hydrolysates that are
made like kind of plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like different proteins,
amino acids, peptides to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's a process that done to the
fish to get them to be easily uptaken for
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good, but they can be a negative
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can overdo the hydrolysate versus some
of the meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would use a little less.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like to use it more in a tea versus
like a top dress or amendment where the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrolysate is more soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks down a lot faster adding it to
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like once you add it to water,
it kind of like disintegrates and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where it's great to for a
quick feed in your plants because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: great for nitrogen source amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go back to like some of the
fish meal, it's slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't break down the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biology has to kind of break it down
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little difference in the
hydrolysate versus meals, especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also mentioned fish meal along with
that fish hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say these are pretty pretty
similar in the sense of what like the NPK
[SPEAKER_01]: is, they're just kind of different forms
or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a nitrogen, they have some
phosphorus, some potassium, but they have
[SPEAKER_00]: more like the amino acid complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a different form of nitrogen,
more in an amino acid form than it is like
[SPEAKER_00]: a nitrite or nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so for fish meal, when would you
typically apply that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, fish meal kind of works through a
lot of the veg state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking to build that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking to build the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take up the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you're getting into flour,
that's when I'd kind of start cutting
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need all those amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already having some stuff that has
nitrogen that's releasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to add more to it if I'm
trying to help with the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might add a little bit, but I'm not
going to add a lot.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on to insect frass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there are a couple types of insect
frass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I use is black soldier insect
frass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know one of the most important
things on this is chitin is what it's
[SPEAKER_01]: known for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about insect frass?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the benefits and how you apply it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something I've talked about for
many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since insect frass came out with their
insect frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always kind of followed Subcool's recipe
on his super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I really started learning about
amendments and learned insect frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insect frass is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are either like a 312 or 222
when it comes to NPK, but most of it's
[SPEAKER_00]: frass, poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another name is guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where bugs eat plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so their frass is not, it's more
omnivore, not herbivore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's plant-based where you're eating all
this plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're eating cytokine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the cytokine, their
shells, like the exoskeletons are the
[SPEAKER_00]: cytokines for these bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they're dying off, their shells
are part of the frass as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where some of the cytokine
comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insect frass has a couple different
brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Soldier flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have different type of mealy bugs or
different type of bugs that they use to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of harvest the frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But frass is great for protozoa as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people do soil biology,
they talk a lot about bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They forget about needing protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protozoa helps eat the bacteria and fungi
to release the nutrients that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: storing in their bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insect frass is one of those things that
actually has protozoa to it like alfalfa
[SPEAKER_00]: meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of in the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to work its way where it's part
of this byproduct that when it's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: water, they kind of start hatching and
releasing like they go in a dormant stage
[SPEAKER_00]: and just kind of wait to be hatched in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But insect frass has always been a great
amendment for the cytokine, for what it
[SPEAKER_00]: brings for the biology, because it also
brings that bacteria fungi and different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains of it to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you're looking for is a
little bit of diversity in soil biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insect frass is to me one of the better
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to add just a couple,
that would be one of them I would be
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to add.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cytokine alone that you get just from
the frass helps with that trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: development, that secondary metabolism in
the plant to fight off pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's that beneficial, to me it's more
beneficial than crab meal, crustacean
[SPEAKER_00]: meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I care if I'm wrong, but there's something
in it that helps with resistance to
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the chitinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the different strains that are in
it of bacteria that you can do a foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: application that's supposed to help fight
off the omicis, the molds, mildews.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely super beneficial,
especially for those of you who are out
[SPEAKER_01]: there that fight powdery mildew,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have issues with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This can be something that you add in as
an amendment and could help fight off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, when we were talking about how the
crab meal, the crustacean have nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios, well, so does insect frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those others don't have protozoa to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protozoa is one of the parts of the soil
food web that you need to have when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing gardening outdoors, indoor
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're trying to mimic mother nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like bacteria, fungi, protozoa,
and on down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the third one in the chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what helps eat the other two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have protozoa or the other
biology that help eat the bacteria and
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi, your nutrients are being locked up
and stored up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not being helpful to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why, to me, it's one of the most
beneficial officials of the crab
[SPEAKER_00]: crustacean insect frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather use that over the guanos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use both types of insect frass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a lot of people who
are like, oh, well, I use microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's a whole lot of
microbial inoculants that have protozoa in
[SPEAKER_01]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's mostly- There is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a show that we were watching the
other day talking about the same problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is one of the things missing in most
people's soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, protozoa is really key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not a lot of products out
there on the market that you can buy that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to retain the protozoa in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you did a bottle of nutrient,
it has a shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protozoa is only going to live in there so
long before they start dying off,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they didn't hibernate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought they were being active.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of that suspended animation type
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they kind of hibernate, then they get
rehydrated, reanimate, come back to life,
[SPEAKER_00]: and do their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of those microbes are dying off,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they go dormant, they die off?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't fully die off, but a lot of
them, it dies back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of hibernate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them really hibernate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that it takes either high
temperatures or like a major disturbance
[SPEAKER_00]: to kill off most of the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a drought to happen, it happens
naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them don't all die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of hibernate until the
conditions are right before they come
[SPEAKER_00]: alive again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with salmonella, E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're around you every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, everything is keeping them at bay
until something causes them to get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: hand and out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's when they become deadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be really surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why a lot of people become in fear
of bacteria, always washing and cleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: and that phobia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the, that's why they're,
oh my God, it's really all around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could kill me at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad, but it's not as deadly as they
make it out to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on to kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp is very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has up to 70 micro macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has different plant growth regulator,
plant growth hormones, PGRs, such as
[SPEAKER_00]: cytokines and oxens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also has some gibberellin in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of them that people really
like to push, but you have to watch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp can have some heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with alfalfa or some of these
other amendments, but there's ways around
[SPEAKER_00]: that and we can talk about that another
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But kelp, it's just an all around one of
the better products really for the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient availability it provides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides more than two thirds of these
products together with the amount of micro
[SPEAKER_00]: macronutrients, the NPK to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's why a lot of people down the
earth, most of their bio lines have kelp
[SPEAKER_00]: to them because they really consider it
that beneficial to their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it has so much nutrient to it and
it's nutrient density that that's why they
[SPEAKER_00]: really look to using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not many other amendments that
have 70 micro macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one thing I preach a lot of
my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Channel is micro macronutrients are very
important because without this,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have certain balances happening
within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't stay in a homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're low on something, it's going to
cause them to start reacted differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants need heavy metals, despite what
we think they need some lead, they need
[SPEAKER_00]: some arsenic, they need boron,
but very, very trace minute amount like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just droplets too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you went like a tenth, a hundredth of
that, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why kelp is so important is
because it has a lot of this what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant needs in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As humans, we need the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a lot of these trace elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get them in our diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil doesn't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These bottled nutrients, they don't have a
lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a lot of these trace elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we find that using amendments
that have higher amounts of trace elements
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a better profile with the plant,
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're healthier because they're getting
the full spectrum of elements that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here about a lot of people talking about
super foods to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will we consider this a super amendment
for your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense, yeah, it would be something
that you would be almost like a super
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those that I would put a top
of my list above most of these other other
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the end all be all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take a few other amendments over
it, but that's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is one of them that if you're not
using something like azomite to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: rock dust, the trace minerals from the
rock dust, this works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps to get those trace elements in
there that you're not getting from the
[SPEAKER_00]: rock dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about azomite in the previous
episode we did together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, that is linked down in the
description section below for you guys to
[SPEAKER_01]: tune into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go over one more and then we will
wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about neem seed meal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so neem seed meal, it's a great
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are over concerned about
something called aziractin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aziractin is toxic to bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not humans, it can be if taken in high
doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But aziractin is part of, how do I want to
describe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extracted, so the neem seed meal is a
by process of different extractions,
[SPEAKER_00]: methods, pulling some of the oils out of
the neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use either alcohol or water,
but neem's made into so many products from
[SPEAKER_00]: toothpaste to different vitamins that we
can take as humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: People in different countries actually eat
some of the neem themselves to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not bad as people make it out to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem seed meal also helps with bad
pathogens and pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep away bad nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have root feeding nematodes,
neem seed will help prevent and keep some
[SPEAKER_00]: of them away from your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem seed meal is also great when it comes
to me, a terpene production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something about the neem seed and I'm not
sure or heard a lot of people talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but I know when I add higher
concentration of it to my soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the smell and the aroma I'm getting from
my plant, it really helps with the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoid or the terpene production in
those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know there is a lot of controversy
behind neem in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you hit the nail on the head there
with the aziractin is what a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: are really complaining about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned, it is commonly used in
so many different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, their concern is, hey, you're
spraying your plants with neem oil because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to use it as an IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, oh, it's systemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not systemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not go into the plant cell tissue
and stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it does is it kind of biodegrades
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an oil, just like everything
else, but they're concerned that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving aziractin as a residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, are you spraying it on
your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're fruiting or in flower,
because most of the time we tell you not
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to spray your fruits and
your flowers, your herbs, if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be using them to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to have a concern of
any aziractin residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first of all, if you actually read the
label and contents, it says there should
[SPEAKER_00]: be none in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be all extracted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the might new traces that are left in
it, it even will tell you that they will
[SPEAKER_00]: cause harm to bugs, not earthworms,
not bigger, like birds or other rodents,
[SPEAKER_00]: insects, because of what it does to their
reproductive organs, what it does to the
[SPEAKER_00]: exoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't do it to us, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, people have talked about,
oh, well, there's deaths in these other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read what happened, it said they
consumed a large amount, more than they
[SPEAKER_00]: should have, and that's what ended up
killing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't just, hey, they took the
recommended dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they took more than what was
recommended and it killed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people talk about a concern of
aziractin, it's not a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not putting high doses of neem seed
meal for your plants to even uptake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not spraying a lot of neem on your
plants for it to be a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I asked you this question at the end of
the last episode that we did together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to ask it again because we
have a lot of new folks that are joining.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we filmed that episode a year ago,
and between now and then, there's been a
[SPEAKER_01]: countless number of people who have just
started gardening for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those folks that are pretty new,
maybe starting to use some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: organic inputs, these organic amendments,
what advice do you have for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some of it's going to depend on if
you're indoor or outdoor cultivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor, you're going directly in the
soil, so you can have problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor, you're getting a soil,
you're kind of creating it, you're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: in different biology, so you kind of
understand what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm looking at amendments and I'm
looking at both conditions, if I'm doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: big garden and I'm trying to prepare it,
I'm going to put down something that has
[SPEAKER_00]: some micro macronutrients, either like
azomite or kelp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kelp is going to give me some of the plant
hormones that my seedlings are looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: to get started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to grow healthy, start shooting out
and up and root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kelp, like we were talking,
is one of those super ones you would put
[SPEAKER_00]: up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would look at insect frass over guano
because the protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting the bacteria,
the fungi, the protozoa, you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: chitinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting stuff that kind of helps
the plants defend themselves, building the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil diversity as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is about soil diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil and the plant are one,
they communicate, they talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant actually eats up the biology and
spits it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a whole other talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you talk to Dr. James White,
he could go into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be two of them, would be
insect frass and the kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really need nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these products have nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people are like, oh, I need
nitrogen, I'm not so worried about
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These products have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need high amounts of nitrogen like
I've been told for years by all these big
[SPEAKER_00]: ad companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you need nitrogen, nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need it, but I don't need high amounts
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfalfa meal would be a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem seed meal would probably be another
good one if I was looking to add a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would find something that's not an
all in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe in the all in ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people like down to earth
has bio life, which is like five products
[SPEAKER_00]: in one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't quite believe in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe doing it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting more instead of like,
I can discuss that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But humic acid, that's another one that
would be up there in my super ones because
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants are trying to create humus
when they're breaking down this product
[SPEAKER_00]: and the humus is retaining all the
nutrients all of your ion bonds,
[SPEAKER_00]: cations for the plant to take up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it stores the energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it stores everything is in
the humus, humic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would look at that because it's very
beneficial for soil biology as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good information there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_01]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can find me on YouTube and
Instagram, both YouTube just over 20 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to do some changes with the
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a few months,
but I want to make it more about a brand
[SPEAKER_00]: and not about me as the person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get more content on there from
other people in the industry, kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: what you've been doing with some of your
channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to get more scientists,
people that are botanists, people soil
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, just people that are really in
the science of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people that follow me,
we really try to turn you on to the
[SPEAKER_00]: science of things and give you just enough
that you want to do the research yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I heard him talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I heard so and so talk about,
oh, well, maybe we need to look it up and
[SPEAKER_00]: see what this is really about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that's my job is to try to
turn people on to that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to try to do more with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to try to do more with my YouTube
channel, try to get more information out
[SPEAKER_00]: and not just through me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely be looking forward to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned so much from you in regards
to organic gardening and just the science
[SPEAKER_01]: behind the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it would be awesome to see you
like interview or like have discussions
[SPEAKER_01]: with people who are on that level,
because I think you'd bring a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: value.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do such a good job of taking that
information and putting it into a form
[SPEAKER_01]: that's digestible to somebody who's pretty
new, you know, without.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to do that, keeping it simple
so it's easy to understand, because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of big complex words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh, my God, like,
how do you even say that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I know that even me being an
educated man, it's still easier for people
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it at the simplest form and move
into something a little harder than trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to start off with harder information that
they don't even understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it can be confusing and a lot of
things can go over people's head for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have a link to your
channel down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_01]: section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're tuned in on one of the podcast
platforms, just search for medically fit
[SPEAKER_01]: on YouTube and his channel will pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good information on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you enjoyed this episode, click that
thumbs up button.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single weekend I'm releasing a new
garden talk podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love for you to tune into
future episodes medically fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, thank you so much for coming
on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, second time around,
I am happy might need a third one
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I create controversy over like Dr.
Bruce Bugsby, comments I made,
[SPEAKER_00]: we might be able to get a third one on
here for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we could definitely go down that
because I know you had quite a few things
[SPEAKER_01]: to say about that particular podcast that
I did with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, maybe that would be a good
episode for the next time around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of going over some of the things
that you had thought that you didn't agree
[SPEAKER_01]: upon with him because there is,
I know you mentioned we won't get too deep
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're closing things up here, but you had
pointed to some studies in regards to that
[SPEAKER_01]: that conflicts with some of the things he
had mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we can go over that in the next
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that might be pretty interesting for
some of your viewers to really hear some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the information from another point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you enjoyed that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will see you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out.
