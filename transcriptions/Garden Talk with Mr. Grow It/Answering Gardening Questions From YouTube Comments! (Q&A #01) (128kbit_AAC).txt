[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grew it and you're watching my extras
channel Got a new video for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well a new type of video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done this type of video before
on this channel I'm gonna answer some
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to look through my youtube
channel comments and A lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: comments I get I'm not able to respond to
so I figure I'd make a video and respond
[SPEAKER_00]: to them here I want to do different types
of videos on this channel the past eight
[SPEAKER_00]: or nine videos, I think Have been part
test videos and people are starting to get
[SPEAKER_00]: sick of them So I am going to try to
switch things up create more content for
[SPEAKER_00]: this channel YouTube likes this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like part test videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like gardening videos They
don't like the plants that I show on the
[SPEAKER_00]: channel So I'm trying to walk a thin line
here particularly on this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways enough of that Let's answer
some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: These questions are coming from my main
YouTube channel if for some reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not subscribed to my channel You're
not aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will link it down in the description
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times do you top?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on growth for me
personally Everybody does it different
[SPEAKER_00]: what I normally do is I'll wait till the
plant gets up till about its fifth node
[SPEAKER_00]: Then only the top of the fifth node and
try to do LST to spread all those lower
[SPEAKER_00]: branches Try to spread them all out as
wide as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when it hits the fifth node I'll
top down to the third node.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on growth more
stretchier strains I'll probably top down
[SPEAKER_00]: more and then do additional tops as well
Indica strains that are real compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to top as much I might top
once if I top it all so it really depends
[SPEAKER_00]: on growth for me The moon and stars are
light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't buy into that Tiny light leaks
will affect your plant enough to stress
[SPEAKER_00]: them out Okay, so he is talking about the
equipment the status light on your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment such as humidifier Dehumidifier
air conditioner, whatever you're running
[SPEAKER_00]: those little status lights that are on
that those LED lights He's saying that he
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't think that that's gonna actually
cause the plants stress Surprisingly,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will I'm talking from experience here
I once left my humidifier light on and my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants they were in flowering and they
stretched for longer than the 21-day
[SPEAKER_00]: period I'm like what the heck is going on
here They seem to have stopped and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they started back up again as far as
stretching and I was like what the heck is
[SPEAKER_00]: going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I realized what has happened is
that I left that humidifier light on so it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't actually affect it to the point
where it Hermit out and was producing
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds right away, which I was kind of
surprised by the moon and stars are lately
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do a Google search and It'll talk
about plant photosynthesis and how the
[SPEAKER_00]: moons and stars actually don't impact that
Enough to where it's gonna, you know cause
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis or stress the plants out
and cause them to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so yeah Germinated seeds sprout first.
[SPEAKER_00]: How soon can I determine the gender of my
seedlings?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seedling send it in to a farmer Freeman
That's my recommendation now There's a fee
[SPEAKER_00]: for that But what they do is they'll take
a microscope and look at the chromosomes
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll be able to tell if your plant
is male or female While it's still a
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that is I want to say
new but it's been around for years now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of people don't know about it
It's all linked that down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below so you can learn
more about it, but I've been doing it and
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a hundred percent accurate since
I've been using that service or we can
[SPEAKER_00]: wait until the plant is late in the
vegetation stage You know weeks four five
[SPEAKER_00]: six It may start showing signs of sex
either pistols for female or pollen sacks
[SPEAKER_00]: for males or when you flip to flowering
it'll then show Either or I'm gonna grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant indoors But it turned out to be a
big one and confusing that how is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: flower I seek some help Okay, so in order
to Switch it over to the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming you're growing a photo period
plant You need to change the light cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: to most people do 12 hours on and then 12
hours of complete darkness Now some people
[SPEAKER_00]: do 11 hours on and 13 hours of complete
darkness Both of those will transition the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to flower stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you switch it over to flower
How smell proof could this material make
[SPEAKER_00]: the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually commenting on my pot panda
film poly film video If installed
[SPEAKER_00]: professionally with taped corners,
would it stop smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: So no poly film a panda film does not stop
the smell at all really if you look into
[SPEAKER_00]: control the smell Look at carbon filter
and you can also look at air purification
[SPEAKER_00]: systems as well something like in viral
cleanse would be Something look into and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link that in the description section
below all the products that talk about in
[SPEAKER_00]: this video will be linked in the
description section below and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: include any discount codes I have for
those products to help you out,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah either carbon Filter or air
purification system that's gonna help with
[SPEAKER_00]: smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so Greg is asking so many to choose
He's actually commenting on one of my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: light videos He says so many to choose I
have a small tent and just need a good
[SPEAKER_00]: light that does everything anyone have any
good recommendations So Greg it really
[SPEAKER_00]: comes down to what size grow space you're
looking to cover Once we know that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of narrow it down a lot actually on
my website mrgrow.com Under the article
[SPEAKER_00]: section you can find articles I've done On
best LED grow lights and I've done those
[SPEAKER_00]: articles last year 2019 I'm working on new
article for this year for different size
[SPEAKER_00]: grow spaces So those articles that I wrote
2019 a little bit outdated, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: still some really good grow lights in
there Definitely check that out if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell us what gross space you're looking to
cover We'll be able to help you out even
[SPEAKER_00]: more if you would have said paper towel
one more time I would have laughed so
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping you'd keep saying it much
love to you girl So a lot of people call
[SPEAKER_00]: out my accent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Boston So I say paper instead of
paper paper towel paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so There's the Boston accent coming
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a question about Farmer Freeman Have
you ever gotten a result that wasn't male
[SPEAKER_00]: or female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they detect a hermy or might it show
as both or inconclusive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a couple select bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to run good question We were just
talking about Farmer Freeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gotten a result that says male
or female now I have gotten a result that
[SPEAKER_00]: said that it was pending and it was gonna
be another day and then it ended up being
[SPEAKER_00]: another day I don't know if they had a
problem with the sample or if they just it
[SPEAKER_00]: was the end of the day and they couldn't
get to that particular one, but Now I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't ever gotten a result that wasn't
male or female.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long darkness Do you give your plants
after 12 12 before harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do 24 hours 48 hours her different
reports?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question It really all depends on my
schedule my personal schedule what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing for the day Well, I mean for the
week actually Sometimes I'll do 48 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do 72 hours of darkness
There's really no set rule that I have for
[SPEAKER_00]: how long to do it now the whole point of
the darkness period is supposedly
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolizes produces Trichomes
while the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people will have a period of
darkness at Harvest well before
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll just put their plant On 24 48
hours 72 hours of darkness and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll harvest but yeah, I mean I do a
little bit of all 24 48 72 I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of marginal as far as the difference
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my personal opinion Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you listen to how those fans hold up,
please?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love design, but the reviews are bad
Okay, so he's talking about that
[SPEAKER_00]: oscillating fan actually clips onto the
grow tent I got that from Vivo Sun so far
[SPEAKER_00]: so good I mean I have two of them running
right now and they've been fine running 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hours a day since I got that let's see 50
days So far so so far so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I saw those same bad reviews on
Amazon if anything updates on there I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely definitely update you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for all the game and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You share with us How can I get one of
your seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a 420 friendly state willing to
pay just trying to get in my hands on a
[SPEAKER_00]: good strain So for those of you guys who
do not know I do have my own strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gee, it's something I've been working
on for Geez, I think it's been almost two
[SPEAKER_00]: years now still I kind of feel like it's
in development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't have to growing right now I had
Some testers working on them and they got
[SPEAKER_00]: some good results But right now long story
short is I don't have any for sale at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment But keep an eye out if I do have
them for sale I will definitely I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: announce them either on Instagram probably
Instagram Twitter and maybe Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, check those platforms That's when I
would that's where I would make the
[SPEAKER_00]: announcement that I would have seats for
sale I'm gonna leave it at that just a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick video just busting out some
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about these questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want me to do more videos like this
in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Videos like this are easy for me to bust
out because I'm not gonna have to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: much editing my main channel for example
videos on there I'm doing at least 10 15
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 hours of work per video and includes
filming editing and then posting onto
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube so something like this it should
only really take me a couple hours just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of cut up and put on to YouTube So I
can do a lot of these videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do a lot of sit-down videos I plan
to do sit-down videos and talking on this
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Let me know what questions you have
that you want to see in future videos let
[SPEAKER_00]: me know what topics you want to see for
videos in the future and I'm gonna try to
[SPEAKER_00]: bust out a lot of content this month and
these upcoming months Especially since we
[SPEAKER_00]: are in quarantine or we have stay at home
orders still at least the state I'm living
[SPEAKER_00]: in Has those stay at home orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope everyone out there is healthy
and stays safe Yeah, and I'll leave it at
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace You You You You You
