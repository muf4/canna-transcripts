[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you thought don't
know me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I've got the California Lightworks
Solar Extreme 500 LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video I'm going to measure the PAR
output.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't be talking about any of the grow
lights features in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually recently released a video where
I unbox the unit and talk about some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the features.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link that video in the description
section below so you can check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the PAR test I'll be using the Apogee
MQ500 PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter shows measurements in PPFD and
it measures from 389 nanometers to 600 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 992 nanometers plus or minus 5 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this grow light is emitting any light
that's outside of that range it will not
[SPEAKER_00]: show on this meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really just to give you a
general idea of what the PAR output is for
[SPEAKER_00]: this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be exact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have this grow light in a grow tent
which has reflective walls so that could
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have the grow tent door open so
we're not getting the reflective on one
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this light in a 4 foot by 4 foot
grow tent which is actually the coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: area for this grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be doing two distances 18 inches
away which is for flowering and 24 inches
[SPEAKER_00]: which is for vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these distances are recommended by
the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like all the other PAR test videos
that I create I will let the measurements
[SPEAKER_00]: do the talking.
Let's get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to this grow light in
the description section below and I will
[SPEAKER_00]: leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
