[SPEAKER_00]: Can you flush organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, but why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing in organics is generally not
recommended because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're flushing out nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you are running into a problem,
you might have to, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you're organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're trying to play soil scientist
and you're feeding in individual
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments as you see fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden there's an
imbalance of nutrients in the medium and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're having problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might warrant a flush, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're talking about flushing at
the end of the grow, I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see a need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever happened to the AC Infinity
clip-on fans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Still use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're working great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're due out next month,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they change it to April slash May.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully they release them soon
because that's a big, it's a hot product
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tips for blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I typically water the medium really well
and then I'll wait a day until I install
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I install the blue mats, make sure
you push them down as far as they need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ceramic should be completely covered
by soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you fill up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any like air bubbles in it,
you can actually use a little pipette and
[SPEAKER_00]: fill the rest of it with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unscrew it real quick and fill the rest
with water because any air bubbles in it
[SPEAKER_00]: could impact the way it drops water down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use two in a seven gallon pot,
one on kind of each side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on what size grow pot you're
in, you may want to consider running two
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're in a larger grow pot instead of
just running one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work good with synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The line, you could have some thicker
synthetic nutrient lineups that would clog
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be careful on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're top dressing with organic
inputs, I typically like to top dress the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients where the spot is to where the
water is dripping down on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it helps ensure that those amendments
are getting wet and staying moist in order
[SPEAKER_00]: for the microbes to be active on there,
breaking them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look into a nutrient well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another technique that you can use
if you're top dressing and using blue
[SPEAKER_00]: mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then check out the podcast episode I
did with Michael Box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just search Mr. Grow It, Michael Box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how to perfectly irrigate your plants
or some title like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out that one because he works for
blue mats and he gave a lot of good advice
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to how to use blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you add oxygen to your water,
air stones?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Aura water, put them into one gallon
jugs from my kitchen sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll bring it up into my grow space
and I'll have a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then depending on what I need to mix
in, I'll just put the gallon of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: two gallons, three gallons, whatever
amount of water I'm using into that five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll mix in my nutrients and then
give to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do any sort of adding oxygen to
the water at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's some good advice for some dense
nugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Add more blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dense nugs, I think number one I'd say is
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna get some genetics that no
matter what you do, in your environment
[SPEAKER_00]: and in your grow, they're just gonna be
airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetics is probably number one I'd
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, I mean, just speaking off the
top of my mind, I don't wanna put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: any particular order, but make sure the
plant has proper nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's lacking in some areas,
particularly those elements that are gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to bud production, then you
might see some airy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity, temperature, humidity,
your environment kind of being dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown some plants in the past where
it was a very dry environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking like 20%, 30% RH and it just,
it did not dense up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might've been because my
temperature was a little bit too high as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure the temperature is in the
proper range, not too high, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: higher the temperature, if you have your
nutrition and environment dialed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: increases photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have, you see it a lot in folks
that are in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, their flowers are bursting out in
all directions towards the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering and then it's kind of becoming
more of an arid structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lowering the temps towards the end of
flowering is another way to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: conserve those dense bud structures as
well as conserve the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that answered your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else we got here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on pre-made soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox Farm is one that I've been using.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you tuned into my channels know
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox Farm Ocean Forest Soil is primarily
what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available in my local nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to buy local.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really get soils shipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some folks that say that
it's too hot for seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to burn your seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only had like maybe one or two plants
that haven't had good results in Fox Farm
[SPEAKER_00]: Ocean Forest Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, you might get a little bit of tip
burn while you're in the veg stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not detrimental to your grow,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's something that you can
easily rebound from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of people shake off Fox
Farm because of that, but I've always been
[SPEAKER_00]: using it and it's been fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-mixed soil in general, it really
depends on which one you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some good ones out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratio is going to be a big impact of
it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually says it on the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some of these pre-mixed bags,
they're going to tell you what it's for,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk about all plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got plants that are like citrus
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have some soil blends that are
particular for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have some soil blends,
particularly for flour, some particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: for vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think primarily that's what a lot of
growers were.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll go off to that pre-mixed soil
that's for vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be where you want to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what therapy grow,
if you have a particular brand in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to be to speak about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the high level,
my high level thoughts on pre-made soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it saves you a lot of work compared to
if you were trying to create your own
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally will, I mean, I've done it
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done paper towel method right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the soak the seeds and then go
to paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've planted directly into the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorites, I've been skipping
the paper towel often for the past several
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been letting it float in water,
a small shot glass of water filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: about three fourths of the way full,
putting the seeds in there and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: let them float for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that the seeds should crack
open and the root will appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, you can go directly into
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could go into the paper towel from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's whatever you really want to do,
but I've done it both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is in a decent range.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to, generally speaking,
you don't have to worry about pH nearly as
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are going to be so many things in
the actual medium that's going to adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the solution you put in,
the pH of that is going to have an impact
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbes are going to have an impact
on the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is going to excrete acids,
which is going to have an impact on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are various things that happen in
the medium that controls the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're putting in the proper pH
nutrient solution or water, then you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be okay, depending on, again,
the variables are the amendments that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're putting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people talk about dolomite lime
as something to buffer pH, something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a low pH dolomite lime,
that's something that you can use in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to raise it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the longest you've grown an auto
flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I still go on growing pop December 4th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So December, January, February,
March.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've been 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at like a hundred and something
hundred and fifteen ish days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about the longest I've done is
about 110.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is the longest I had to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes just weren't ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it said it was like a 75 day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ended up going 110.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenos went 75, 80,
85, but other phenos had to go 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: 110.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not anymore, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have so many seeds from so many
different breeders that I don't I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: been cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't cloned in years, actually,
just because I don't need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just plant the seeds and I don't do
perpetual either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just grow from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it grows over, I'll restart.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the craziest way you trained?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk about a terrible way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I took I tried the old in my
opinion, you know, the plant grew like
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy and then I basically just bent this
one, the main stock down and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started training too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so and it was so like lopsided.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it came around, like, you know,
eventually the branches grew up and the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds just caused it to be such a shifty
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just not ideal in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be like the craziest way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I've done main lining before.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you consider that crazy or not,
I personally like to do a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: variation to main lining, which is I
usually wait until the plant grows to its
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth or fifth node, then I'll top down
to the third node.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave the second node branches that
come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll remove the first node branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the node as the branches from the
second and third node grow up,
[SPEAKER_00]: top those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got yourself eight main
tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of four, you would do a top on
each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would go to eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can let it grow a bit more and do
again and go 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 main tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone as high as just 30, 32 main
tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was a little bit too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'd ever as an indoor
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I would ever go do that
again indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 was a good amount in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight was also a good amount as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you check moisture content in the
medium?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of dials in the moisture
level on the medium without actually
[SPEAKER_00]: needing to know what that moisture level
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to get one of those moisture
meters though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get one of those actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the reminder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite line of a dry
amendments?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the build a soil craft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been my go-to recently for the past
year, year and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so easy to use just one cup per
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have that initial amending
of the medium and that's one cup per plant
[SPEAKER_00]: before flipping the flower 30 days into
flower, depending on if you're an eight
[SPEAKER_00]: week cultivar or nine, 10 week or beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to do another top dressing
on top of it, but I've had good results
[SPEAKER_00]: with build a soil craft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any tips for dry and cure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry 60, 60, 60% humidity, 60 degrees
Fahrenheit if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your temperature goes up 70,
75, the higher it goes up, the more
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes are volatizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're losing those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little tip for flower is drop your
temperatures towards the end of flower to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of conserve terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with curing your storage
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people ignore that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in an area here where it's probably
what, 75 degrees right now, just in this
[SPEAKER_00]: room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I had a jar, like I have a jar
right here, I'm potentially losing some
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes just from this regular
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I now have a wine fridge that I have set
to, I think the upper part is set to 54,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lower part is set to 60 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I store them in there in order to
try to conserve terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use silica throughout the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's safe to use throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many benefits for silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now short answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use silica throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does freak show have a traditional skunky
smell or something different?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's more of like a,
at least the cultivar I have is more of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lemony type smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was moving the freak show from one tent
to another and I had it like all over my
[SPEAKER_00]: arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was flopping all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are just, they're so heavy that
they're flopping all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had it all over my arms and I'm just
like smelling myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's definitely more of a lemony,
at least for the phenos that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: When will Chillout OG be sent out for
testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people been asking that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently right now I'm working,
I just planted some F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go towards an F3,
see what I get there, then potentially go
[SPEAKER_00]: down to an F4 and F5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got, it's a ways to go until I
stabilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really when you go down generation to
generation, it's just, it becomes more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now with F2s it opens up the gene
pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much knowledge you have
in regards to this, but it's going to open
[SPEAKER_00]: up the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a lot of characteristics from
both the male and the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I were to send out F2s,
all of the ones you plant, you could see a
[SPEAKER_00]: ton of differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally would want it to be more
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's going to be a little
while here next year at the earliest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, I'll see you next
time.
