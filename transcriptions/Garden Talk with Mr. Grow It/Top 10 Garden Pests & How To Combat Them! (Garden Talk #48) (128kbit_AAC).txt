[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're unmated, they produce males.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're mated, they'll produce females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it only takes one female mite for you
to have an infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a lot of reasons, Brix doesn't
really make sense as a proxy for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health, but it can be really helpful just
to gauge the photosynthetic rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be very careful and cautious
because a lot of the medicinal substances
[SPEAKER_00]: and things might be associated with the
flowering or perhaps even the fruiting
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's very useful to utilize
things like wettable sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not burned sulfur, but wettable sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have aphids and you see these
worm-like organisms kind of around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't kill them because they're not
caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually going to attack the
aphids that you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to be careful because if we
over apply these sorts of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can run into resistance issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Matthew Gates.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have been on multiple podcasts or live
streams and you have a ton of knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to different insects and
that's what we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going to be action packed for
those of you who are worried about pests
[SPEAKER_01]: or are battling pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go over the top 10 or at
least we're going to try to get through
[SPEAKER_01]: the top 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to get through some of the
common pests that invade your garden and
[SPEAKER_01]: things you can do to combat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So super excited for this conversation
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first things I like to do first is
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and kind of how you got into
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Matthew Gates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professionally I work as an IPM
specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stands for Integrated Pest Management
and I've been doing this for about 11
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be 12 years in April of this
year actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been interested in growing plants and
especially looking at insects and other
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of creepy crawlies as some people
would call them since I was a very young
[SPEAKER_00]: child to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown as a gardener since my early
teenage years when I used to plant certain
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in my parents' house and that sort
of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very foundational for me and now I
work in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have a YouTube channel that I'm
promoting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm subscribed to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have that link down in the
YouTube description section below for
[SPEAKER_01]: those of you that are tuning in on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for those that are on the podcast
platforms, can you tell us what it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the name of the channel is Zenthenol
and the name of my consulting group is
[SPEAKER_00]: Zenthenol Consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that channel, I like to talk about
various plant health topics, usually
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on pests in my Pest Primer series
where I go over very quickly, very
[SPEAKER_00]: information-dense pests or packets of
information about various pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aphids and fungus gnats and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to treat them, their physiology,
strengths and weaknesses and other sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: of cool details that will help you succeed
in treating them in a holistic manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's get right into some of the
common pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to start with fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something I've battled many
times in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, especially if you're growing
organically, you know, one of the key
[SPEAKER_01]: things to do is to keep the medium moist,
you know, have those microbes working to
[SPEAKER_01]: break down those amendments, make them
available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, fungus gnats thrive on that wet
medium, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they come through very, very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about fungus gnats,
maybe, you know, what are fungus gnats,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, ways to battle them,
et cetera, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've hit the nail on the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the major problem is that on the
one hand, you need that moisture in your
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate, but at the same time,
fungus gnats and other organisms love that
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's good for the plants is good for the
pests, as it turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do tell people very often,
not just for fungus gnats, but other sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: of pests, especially if you have a mulch,
that sometimes the best thing you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually kind of let things dry out at
the top layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's sort of unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does sort of, obviously will affect
some level of microbial diversity and,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, your top soil dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, if you kind of
have an overrun or overabundance of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's sometimes what you have to do,
at least to get it a little bit under
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are various products that you can
use as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my favorite way to go about it,
if you're a home grower, sometimes you can
[SPEAKER_00]: acquire things like nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few different ones you can
apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that they work really well in my
personal experience, not only in home
[SPEAKER_00]: growing settings, but also commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steiner Nema Felsiae, or SF, is very
commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also use Steiner Nema
Caprocapsi, I believe it's how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: pronounced, which is like SC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But personally, I just like to use the SF
nematodes or an application of Buvaria
[SPEAKER_00]: bastiana, which is an entomopathogenic
fungus that's commercially available,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think you can also acquire it in
other cases for the home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are also botanical insecticides
that you can use that are derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: plants like azadirachtin from Neem or
pyrethrin from chrysanthemum plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to be a little bit careful
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, especially in a home
grow setting, you don't necessarily know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's been my experience, that some
plants will react totally fine if you
[SPEAKER_00]: apply at the label rate or half the label
rate or whatever that is for you where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes plants are very susceptible
or for whatever reason weak to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you're using a new product like
that, I always caution.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people apply it sort of at a lower
rate just to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually have the yellow sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put them by the grow pot by soil level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I can see if they have the problem to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then from there, I'll do treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've done neem oil in the past,
which you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to know specifically what's your
recommendation for how often to spray neem
[SPEAKER_01]: oil in regards to getting rid of fungus
deaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say when it comes to application
rates, that's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will be true for all the pests we
talk about to a crop scout and to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: vigilant in looking at your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because sometimes you can apply something,
and in one context, you can be one and
[SPEAKER_00]: done very rarely, but it happens
sometimes, or maybe two and done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can apply it one day, then wait a
day and take a look, and then maybe apply
[SPEAKER_00]: the next day or the day after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's always going to be constantly
looking at your status and your particular
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: With fungus nets too, you make a great
point about having the sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also really useful to sometimes have
them outside of your property so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see what you acquire outside and you
can see what the pressure is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ambient location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you have something as simple as
a leaky pipe or some other sort of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that creates a water dense zone of
moisture surrounding your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you live near a river or a stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be a potential sort of haven
for these fungus nets and other pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then they can ingress from that
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're aware of your context outside
as well as inside the cultivation space,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I think that's a very useful
information and can help modulate how
[SPEAKER_00]: often you have to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, in some cases,
people just get them too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because of their locality rather
than them doing anything specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about nematodes?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that was a way to combat
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never used them before.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the typical application rate for
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it does really depend on your
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would try to apply them when you have a
heavy amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be worth the economically and
also sort of the hassle, especially as a
[SPEAKER_00]: home grower, to apply them unless you're
applying them perhaps regularly or if the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop that you're growing is just sort of
worth it for you potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of factors to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times, these nematodes come
in quite large amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might even purchase them in the
millions and perhaps multiple millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to apply them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually there will be some sort of
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always talk to the suppliers to
get better information about their
[SPEAKER_00]: specific product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's usually very important to apply
them if you're watering them in with some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of adjectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that people often don't
remember to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is that all the
nematodes sort of stay at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're watering it in maybe through
some sort of pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you're using a nozzle
that has grating, you will smash the
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they won't exist any longer if they go
through some sort of mesh grating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the two perhaps biggest
things that I see people make an error
[SPEAKER_00]: about when it comes to fungistan
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or rather, nematode application for fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nematodes, you can see you can buy them
off of Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard mixed reviews off of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like sometimes they show up dead or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have like a source that you can
recommend for nematodes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of biocontrol companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always say this, so I'll keep it
very brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, there are primary producers
and there are tertiary producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, you don't want to buy from
tertiary producers because the product is
[SPEAKER_00]: usually not up to snuff for various
reasons, either because they got the
[SPEAKER_00]: biocontrols and they've kind of kept them
in this sort of, you know, staging system
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're not really the freshest that
they could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you might get something
secondhand if you go tertiary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from primary producers, there are
several.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copper biological systems is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insectary is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't have the nematodes,
themselves for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe supplies, they'll definitely know a
source for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually these places are very
professional and are willing to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: point you in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one last thing, which we probably
should have gone over in the beginning is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is understanding the life cycle a little
bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you have a population of
fungus gnats, you could get a little
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're spraying neem and all of a
sudden they're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they've laid eggs, you know,
in the medium, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you could have a whole new
population happened after a little while,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is kind of the life cycle of a
fungus net?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many kinds of fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people interact with the dark
winged fungus gnats, which is the Bordesia
[SPEAKER_00]: genus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can tell them they're very often
control confused for like aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially like rice root aphids and
things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're very thin bodied.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to walk and they're very nimble
when they walk across like a substrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, like your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the adults look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of thin, tiny flies,
not very substantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't, they don't approach anywhere
near the size of like a house fly,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're very dainty, but the fungus
net larvae themselves can be told from
[SPEAKER_00]: other sort of worm-like organisms because
they have a white cream colored body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can see the gray intestinal
tract and they'll have a black capsule
[SPEAKER_00]: head, which is very important because
other, fly larvae may lack this entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can definitely tell them from other
things that are part of different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a white color larva that can get
about, you know, a few millimeters long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes they can also produce sort
of a mucus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a large population of them,
or if you have a population, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: after you've dried, they can use that
mucus and create kind of like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a tunnel that can be shelter for them
when it gets drier as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one reason why drying might not
be enough and you have to go in with some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, you could use something like
a bacillus product, but specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: something like Israelensis, bacillus
subtilis, or sorry, bacillus
[SPEAKER_00]: thuringiensis, Israelensis, which I will
be happy to talk about or spell for anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: who needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the particular fly associated
subtype for that species of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some good information for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another thing that's very, very common
in the grow realm, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors, outdoors, talk to us about spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are spider mites?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe talk about their life cycle of
spider mites and how to battle them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spider mites, I love to talk about
because they're, uh, they're amazingly
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feed on over 13,000 or 1300 rather
plants out there that are documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do this really well because much of
their genome is actually associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: detoxification and plant immune system
suppression genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they go to feed on the plant,
they will feed on the individual cell
[SPEAKER_00]: contents with their stylet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they do that, they produce a
saliva that suppresses the immune response
[SPEAKER_00]: locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also are able to detoxify like
toxins and things that the plant produces
[SPEAKER_00]: that could be poisonous for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And spider mites are haplodiploid,
which is just a fancy way of saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: the females, if they're mated,
will produce males or rather if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: unmated, they produce males.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're mated, they'll produce females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it only takes one female mite for you
to have an infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will, when populations get very
large, uh, they tend to produce a more
[SPEAKER_00]: dense webbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll produce small amounts of webbing
when they're a small colony and they
[SPEAKER_00]: produce round circular eggs and they have
a red color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they often have this sort of two
spotting, which is actually their
[SPEAKER_00]: intestinal pouches.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they haven't fed very much yet,
or if they're a particular subtype,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the, um, uh, the red form,
that's just bright cinnabar color,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, then you might think, Oh, it doesn't
have the two spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might not be the two spots spider
mites, but indeed they come in several
[SPEAKER_00]: different colors like green or whitish or
reddish or orangish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to be vigilant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what happens is that when the
population gets high, they will,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll sort of aggregate at the top of
the plant and they will try to use silk in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to, um, catch the air like baby
spiders often do and, um, move a short
[SPEAKER_00]: distance or sometimes in some cases,
Oh, quite a long distance on air currents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually a common thing with a
lot of, um, arachnids and insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they lay their eggs underneath
the leaf, right on the bottom part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, oftentimes a general
practice is to inspect the leaves on a
[SPEAKER_01]: daily basis, you know, and looking the
underside of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are small enough to where you're
going to need a little handheld
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that you can usually see them
visibly with your eyes naked, but it
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely can help you, especially if
maybe your eyesight's a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, one for wear or, um, if you're in a
situation where, cause sometimes they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't move that often when they're
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be a little bit difficult,
but as you say, um, not only spider mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: but many other insects that feed on leaves
and or rather mites and arthropods,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find them on the underside of
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a variety of reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It evades a predation, but also the
harmful UV rays from the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment is usually not great for them
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it's a great way for them to get
both benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: In regards to combating them, spraying,
a lot of people like to use sprays to
[SPEAKER_01]: combat them, you know, whether it be in
veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when you get up to flower,
people don't want to spray at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any recommendations for
sprays?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've talked about application
rates a little bit, but can you give us a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of background on the sprays
that can be used?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it's very useful to
utilize things like wettable sulfur,
[SPEAKER_00]: not burned sulfur, but wettable sulfur,
uh, granules that you can apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great with plants that,
uh, don't have some sort of a,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like if they have delicate flowers
that you're trying to, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so avoid damaging, sometimes you can use
this and you won't have a problem as much
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have with some harsh chemistry
potentially or a harsher chemistry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it really is plant dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's great if the plants are in some
sort of a non floral reproductive stage
[SPEAKER_00]: because those tissues can be a little bit,
um, like I said, delicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you apply, um, to like a house
plants or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get good coverage pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sulfur is also going to be really
well, uh, to do against not just spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites, but other sorts of insects that
will talk about later.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to use that because it's very
cheap, very affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it in most places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that makes it a very ideal thing to
apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can also use other chemistries as
well, but, um, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that to be a pretty useful one to
utilize that you can have access to that's
[SPEAKER_00]: non-commercial at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe to spray on flowers too or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the flower we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in my experience, uh, even in
commercial settings, with ornamental
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, uh, what about sulfur worked
pretty fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we didn't get too Randy with
the, um, uh, with the level, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: we even sprayed it on Gerbera daisies,
lilies, roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have a problem really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some spray roses, maybe if they're
very young, uh, could be negatively
[SPEAKER_00]: affected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then medicinal varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I wouldn't apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be very careful and cautious
because a lot of the medicinal substances
[SPEAKER_00]: and things might be associated with the
flowering or perhaps even the fruiting
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I would just try to keep that
exposure to a minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one last thing, environment for
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard they thrive in, correct me if
I'm wrong, warmer conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it make sense to potentially,
if you, if you have a spider mite
[SPEAKER_01]: infestation to lower the temps
temporarily, to try to reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduction or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had people ask me that several
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that generally you probably
don't get too much of a benefit out of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for using some sort of a,
an application very quickly, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely right that they are associated
with higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, to that end, you bring up a
really great point because if you track
[SPEAKER_00]: your pests, um, and I recommend people do
this, uh, they can kind of find,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find patterns that maybe you get
spider mites generally on the onset of
[SPEAKER_00]: like late spring, early summer where it
gets hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you know that already,
you can kind of get yourself ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: that potential ingress seasonally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be very, very useful in my
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I battle aphids particularly in my
outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing in my vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some, some beautiful lettuce,
some kale, and then my bok choy and the
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids liked the bok choy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if it was because the bok
choy was starting to get deficiencies or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know generally speaking, if a plant is
weakened, it's going through some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more prone to getting pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, my bok choy was just,
it was loaded with aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they were borrowed, like deep
inside the leaves and this was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I've had a bad past experience
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's their life cycle, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aphids are very complicated to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a sort of an interesting life
cycle for a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they tend to be very host specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll only feed on one or a few
related species, or they sometimes are
[SPEAKER_00]: very generalistic and they'll feed on tons
of different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peach aphid is a good example of the
latter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, I can totally visualize what
you're talking about a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're clonal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aphids are generally female.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are sometimes males.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually colonies are clonal females
with a live birth clonal offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, aphids are born, not just
mothers, but grandmothers, believe it or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's, that owes to their
reproductive capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce tons of, of a, of a young,
and that's the key to their ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so those clonal populations,
they'll just keep reproducing and
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducing on a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the plant starts to send that,
um, aphids, um, or like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might get some sort of nutrient
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can taste that essentially when
they're feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might stimulate in addition to
like, sort of whether patterns changing or
[SPEAKER_00]: other sorts of things like that,
that can stimulate them to create a second
[SPEAKER_00]: adult form that has wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that winged form is meant to disperse
to other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and some, sir, some aphids,
this, they require an alternative host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll, they'll feed on like weedy
plants or herbaceous plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: On one and some seasons, and then they'll
switch to like woodier tree-like plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: another case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only aphids do this, but that is,
um, one other kind of lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they create the winged forms in
that case, they might be going to that
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative host, or they're just trying
to seek another host, um, to go to,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause the colony is probably
well-developed at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's their life cycle essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's many things you can use to
affect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we, we talked about spider mites
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get bio-controls for them
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, for the spider mites,
persimilis is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've often recommended them,
uh, quite a bit for aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use things like, uh, aphidus wasps
as well, aphidus ervii, aphidus metrocarii
[SPEAKER_00]: are really common to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they parasitize the aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also get the, um, aphidalides
aphidamiza, which is a, a midge,
[SPEAKER_00]: the larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of which will feed on aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a home grower, you should
watch out for things called hoverflies or
[SPEAKER_00]: syrphidae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the syrphidae family are these bright,
almost wasp-like colored hoverflies
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're called hoverflies or flower
flies because the adults kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: hummingbird can hover in one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you can sometimes find these
larvae that can kind of look like
[SPEAKER_00]: caterpillars, um, kind of bounding up and
down your plants, looking for aphids to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, one of the things that I have on
my YouTube channel are observational
[SPEAKER_00]: footage and clips of hoverflies and
beneficial insects and pests as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're curious about what they can
look like, you can check them out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, uh, it's very important if you
see a colony, um, of aphids and you see
[SPEAKER_00]: these like worm-like organisms kind of
around them, uh, don't kill them because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually going to attack the
aphids that you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's an important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I like to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one more follow up question in
regards to, you know, plant being
[SPEAKER_01]: deficient and a pest being more prone to
attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've heard talking about bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how familiar you are with
bricks levels, but from what is said very
[SPEAKER_01]: often is that if your bricks level is
above 12%, you're pretty much invisible to
[SPEAKER_01]: pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true or is that bro science?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's never been my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, I have actually made several
videos about this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very pernicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, basically, so bricks has to do with
not a lot of times people simplify to
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times people are looking for
sugar content, specifically the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I like to say it like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bricks can't not be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be helpful to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photosynthates incredibly important
for, um, the basic powering of its
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's, it can't not, not be
helpful, but, uh, um, insects and other
[SPEAKER_00]: things have great ways of feeding on
plants and the sugars inside and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: other constituents in the phloem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bricks levels also change rapidly,
especially if we're dealing with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, most plants that people are dealing
with that, uh, photosynthesize way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They photosynthesize during the day and
then all that, all those process kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: shut off during nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all plants do this, but a lot of them
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, in that case you're getting
bricks levels that are not the same
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a lot of reasons, bricks doesn't
really make sense as a proxy for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health, uh, but it can be really helpful
just to gauge the photosynthetic rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and to that matter, aphids and many
other insects have tons of enzymes and
[SPEAKER_00]: detoxification genes and things related
to, um, suppressing plant immune response
[SPEAKER_00]: and suppressing or detoxifying compounds
and aphids are particularly good at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in my video about aphid physiology and
why aphids can eat healthy plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I go over with research from an insect
physiologist, um, that talks about how
[SPEAKER_00]: they were able to get aphids to feed on,
uh, sugar sources of 34% bricks,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, which is pretty massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, they were also able to target,
sorry, they were able to target the rate
[SPEAKER_00]: at which when they increase the bricks,
that how the aphids were able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, basically, uh, degrade the sugars that
they were feeding on and, um, deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: them totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as they moved from one megapascal to
four megapascals of pressure, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about how small these
insects are, the sugars were so
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated, um, you could, you could say
that four megapascals is about the
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure that a paintball marker makes,
you know, when it's propelling a
[SPEAKER_00]: paintball.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty, pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the enzymes in them were able to break
down those sugars, uh, with no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they excrete them as honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh, that's another thing we should
probably talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great way to find if you have aphids is
if you see these, the sticky substance on
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves of your plants, you can look up
from those leaves and you can often find
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that honeydew is colonized
with a fungus called city mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not directly pathogenic to the plant,
but it does grow on the honeydew and it
[SPEAKER_00]: can make the plants, um, not cosmetically
viable, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely some useful information there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about thrips?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are thrips and what are their life
cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great that she mentioned thrips right
after aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe it or not, they're very closely
related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the two orders of, uh, Hemitura and
Thysanoptera.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, they diverted and,
um, they have a lot of similar
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, thrips are, uh, there's over 5,000
species of thrips, but a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of them are actually pest,
um, species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the one that most people are
dealing with are Western flower thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also other ones like chili thrips
and onion thrips, which are also very
[SPEAKER_00]: common to deal with, but I think Western
flower thrips is, is the most documented
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most research actually concerns
Western flower thrips as they,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, reproduce essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some thrips don't do this, but a lot of
thrips will, and Western flower thrips in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular will actually put their eggs
inside the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can run into a situation where
somebody maybe is a nursery and they spray
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do whatever with the contact spray
or by bio controls and they're thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell it to somebody and thrips are
coming out of the tissues, the little baby
[SPEAKER_00]: nymphs, uh, yeah, nymphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those nymphs come out, they feed on
the plant tissues and they create this
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of silvering or scarring damage from
their feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can usually tell thrips from other
pests, not only because they have this
[SPEAKER_00]: like thin kind of like cigar shape,
uh, especially as nymphs, but also as
[SPEAKER_00]: adults, they have these feathery wings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're scoping them, you can kind of
see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a very, um, very specific kind
of look to them, this sort of thin look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows them to get into crevices
really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can often feed on pollen as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your plant feeds or creates copious
amounts of pollen, then that can be also a
[SPEAKER_00]: big food source for them and especially
the females to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but as the nymphs feed,
they will turn into pupae and those pupae
[SPEAKER_00]: will often fall to the ground,
which is why a comprehensive treatment for
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips often includes something in the
soil, either a biocontrol or some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a spray application so that you can get
them or onto the ground itself if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing inside, because, um, whether in a
greenhouse or in just like a home grow
[SPEAKER_00]: situation, uh, the floor can also be a
residual place for various pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: but especially these pupae.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over time, those pupae will
develop and adults will come out and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they're very, very vagile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll, they'll fly all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll fly all over the place and they're
really great at getting into places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, many research reports have been,
um, produced simply describing how good
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips are at evading, uh, destruction and
getting into new places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't feel too bad if you get a thrips,
uh, ingress into your location because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're everywhere basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are some of the sprays that you
can use or ways to combat thrips?
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite way to combat thrips is
actually using predatory mites and
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining a population at a certain
level inside your home grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this actually works out really well
for other mites that are, especially those
[SPEAKER_00]: you are able to, uh, maintain on some sort
of alternative food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a feeder mite, for example,
swirsky or cocoomerous mites are preferred
[SPEAKER_00]: for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll also feed on other things like
white flies or, uh, sometimes moth eggs,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, as well as, um, uh,
russet mites and broad mites and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get kind of a generalized,
uh, protection from having that population
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in addition to that, you can also use
things like the wadable sulfur I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, many thrips have actually developed
quite a robust resistance to some of even
[SPEAKER_00]: the harsh tree chemistries that it
wouldn't advocate for people to utilize,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, sort of systemic, uh, pesticides and
things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then the resistance makes it even
less of a viable choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the azadirachtin and pyrethrin I
mentioned, which is pretty common and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people like to use, I find often
does work as well, but you got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: careful because if we over apply these
sorts of things, we can run into
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to white flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've actually had a couple flying
around in my grow room, my indoor grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room, killed them off and that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't last very long, but talk to us
about white flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's their life cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So white flies are really interesting
because, um, there's several different
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of people deal with the
so-called silver leaf white fly,
[SPEAKER_00]: bemusia tabassi, but there's also,
um, the greenhouse white fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a trial, trial ludes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, there's a couple of others out
there, even a black white fly,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a white fly, but it's colored
black.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, these, they, as nymphs,
they actually look like little scale
[SPEAKER_00]: insects, little, um, kind of sessile,
just like clumps, um, on your plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: on your leaves or on your stems
potentially, but usually on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, as they develop, at least with
the silver leaf white fly, you can start
[SPEAKER_00]: to see little eyes on the, uh,
on the nymph and they pupate and then
[SPEAKER_00]: adults will come out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adults are usually white with sort of a
waxy, uh, covering on their, on their
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I guess they're colored white,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they will feed in the same place
where their nymphs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually they like to aggregate as a
colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I often find that they're,
they're, they're, they work the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, in places where the foliage is
like denser and there's a lot less light
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that that's pretty common in a lot
of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, there's many ways you can combat
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of the sprays that I've already
mentioned before work really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually cut my teeth on using Buveria
bassiana against white flies to great,
[SPEAKER_00]: great effect because they tend to stay
together like they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fungus, when you spray it,
the spores germinate on the body,
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrate the cuticle, kill them from the
inside out, and then they just move on to
[SPEAKER_00]: the very next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a terrible way to go out if
you ask me, but it's very highly
[SPEAKER_00]: effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I should also mention that
specifically for the silver leaf white
[SPEAKER_00]: fly, it's a super vector of over 480 plant
viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although aphids tend to be the supreme
plant virus vector, white flies are
[SPEAKER_00]: probably right up there, especially this
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you grow plants like beets or
peppers or tomatoes or things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, just be aware that sometimes you might
get a pathogen like a virus, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be very lethal to your plant as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be careful with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you've actually mentioned,
I find white flies are pretty easy to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned, you know, viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about before this, uh,
an episode on a complete episode on
[SPEAKER_01]: viroids, viruses, funguses, stuff like
that would be a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe in the future we can do a part
two, where we get into detail on those
[SPEAKER_01]: things, because I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of information to be said
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there's a lot of things
that people don't know about that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and how easy it is to transfer
viruses, for example, from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe in the future we can do a part
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing that I wanted to ask would
be, are white flies attracted to the
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow stickies like other flies typically
are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, uh, one of the, the viruses that
we were, that I was mentioning earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it destroys parts of its brain,
the white fly, in order to allow it to not
[SPEAKER_00]: have a preference for yellow, which allows
the virus to likely go to a green plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So believe it or not, that's pretty
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, in fact, white flies do prefer,
like a lot of insects, the yellow color,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, because it's usually a sign of
senescence or nutrient deficiency or some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a pathogen and that will make the
plant an easier host.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about next we go into russet mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about russet mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to let us know what they are,
their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard they're a beast to battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in, uh, there are several russet
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, most russet mites, if you look at
the entire group and they're not very well
[SPEAKER_00]: documented, to be honest, but a lot of
russet mites are actually not passed to
[SPEAKER_00]: their hosts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, most russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Russet mites out in nature, which there
are many thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it actually don't cause a lot of
problems, but those that we do know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're sometimes called blister mites
because they can produce like a gall in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of different russet mites have
this effect on various trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but, uh, russet mites that we find in,
uh, crop protection, agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: like aloe russet mite or citrus russet
mite or, uh, other kinds of russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because they are very, very,
very damaging to the host.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a lot of cases, honestly,
sometimes the best thing you can do is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually call a couple of the plants if
they are very heavily infested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like very carefully taking them out of
whatever your setup is and putting them in
[SPEAKER_00]: a bag, tying off the bag and throwing it
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, russet mites are typically
specialists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't typically feed on other
plants of a different species or genus or
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, for example, if you have tomato
russet mite, it's very unlikely,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much not going to happen that that
russet mites is going to feed on something
[SPEAKER_00]: like aloe or citrus, like I mentioned
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's also a rose bud mite for that
matter that transmits a virus that I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually had the ignoble experience of
having to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we bought all these new roses at an
ornamental grow that I worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those roses all came from a nursery
that just got done being shut down for
[SPEAKER_00]: like a year and a half, cleaning
everything, getting rid of everything
[SPEAKER_00]: because they had this virus that's,
uh, vectored by the russet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that russet mite came right back
and we had to, we had to quarantine all of
[SPEAKER_00]: our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very, very arduous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So russet mites are very difficult to deal
with typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things you can do for them are
like the predatory mites I had mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, because russet mites can often
be, uh, transferred on the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they can catch wind really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a strong gust of wind, they can be
propelled up into the air and move,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, hundreds of meters, sometimes short
distances, sometimes long distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but what'll happen oftentimes they'll
get into your grow either on people's
[SPEAKER_00]: clothing or on the wind or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get onto one plant and they have
a very simple life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live fast and they reproduce often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't survive for very much more
than like nine or 10 days in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cases and they reproduce rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually what'll happen is that they
come in on the wind or if they get
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred to somebody up through
clothing, there'll be like one or a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of hotspots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those pop, those plants that get
infected first will sort of show the
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms much quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, if you recognize it immediately,
uh, russet mites often create a,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, like a crinkled surface on the leaves
of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they can cause a, um, a crinkling and
if they're in a high population,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can almost see them like a orange,
reddish orange dust, uh, on the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, which is a very bizarre looking
for people who have not experienced it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do have that case, I would
recommend culling the plants that are most
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic and then applying something
like a sulfur spray, like I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, or predatory micek, swirsky or
cocoomerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I find it is highly effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned culling off the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So killing off the plants is the last
thing people want to do, but I'm glad
[SPEAKER_01]: you're brutally honest because there's,
I've seen so many people that have gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: russet mites, you know, and it's,
it's too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they, they got to the point
where they have to cull it because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: just no way around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So inspecting your plan on a daily basis,
once you identify it, take an immediate
[SPEAKER_01]: action is certainly key for, for something
like russet mites for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rapidity, especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to agree with you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about broad mites?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about broad mites and
kind of their life cycle and such?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So broad mites are very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In damage and in profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So russet mites have a sort of worm-like
body when you see them under a scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and broad mice have kind of a American
football shape to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, whereas russet mice produce kind
of circular eggs, broad mites produce like
[SPEAKER_00]: a sort of a oblong egg that has,
um, little protrusions called tubercles,
[SPEAKER_00]: but on a camera, they often look like
polka dots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they, if it's sort of a dotted egg that
you're looking at and you see sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: similar, uh, crinkling, gnarling that's
happening to your plant leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're probably dealing with broad
mites, but you'll probably also see the
[SPEAKER_00]: adults moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so russet, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So broad mites, uh, have a similar sort of
treatment regimen to russet mites,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be honest, because it caused similar
damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's oftentimes very useful to just get
rid of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's very highly infested, if you have
like a row of plants, or if you have like
[SPEAKER_00]: a homegrown situation where you've got
like, again, like a bed row and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: like multiple plants, but like one or two
of them is really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I very much recommend just getting rid of
one of the worst ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can afford to do so, uh,
it can be very critical to your,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you said, to your success at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's why it's important to be very
vigilant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can see the damage earlier and
when it's only on a couple of leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than the entire plant, you are
going to be much more successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, um, applications of things like
sulfur sprays are very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to sound too much like a
broken record there, but, um, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these predatory mites are very useful for
that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why people like to use them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, maintaining that population
before you get the problem is really great
[SPEAKER_00]: because an ingressing small population
gets decimated and annihilated way before
[SPEAKER_00]: it approaches sort of a pestiferous level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see, let me think about that for
a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that everything that's important for
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, oh, well we just talked about white
flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So believe it or not, the silver leaf
white fly is another problem, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: that broad mites are actually attracted to
the wax that they produce, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: that species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so broad mites will get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a very famous, uh, scanning
electron microscope image of a white fly
[SPEAKER_00]: with a bunch of broad mites on its legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, what will happen is that the
broad mites attached to them, the white
[SPEAKER_00]: fly flies to another plant and the broad
mites feed on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broad mites genus name is
Polyphagotarsinemus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tarsinemus is the type of mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poly means many, phago means eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat a lot of plants, many,
many, many kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever the white fly lands on,
it's probably a suitable host.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing to watch out for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned for all the pests you talk
about, sometimes you mentioned kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: what the damage would look like on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume that the folks could potentially
go to your YouTube channel and kind of see
[SPEAKER_01]: more detailed images of like, you know,
the damage that the pests do to plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have a website or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you can find a lot of that,
uh, information.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I do have a video on broad mite
damage in particular and what they look
[SPEAKER_00]: like when you're looking at them through
the microscope and also what their damage
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so that's Zenthanol on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can also check me out on zenthanol
.com as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, a lot of that free educational
information is on the Zenthanol YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people just don't get access to
this kind of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or these pictures until they actually have
to deal with them, which is way too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but if they're able to recognize it
earlier, um, it just, it is night and day
[SPEAKER_00]: for success rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome that they can just go to
your channel and reference those because
[SPEAKER_01]: that can definitely be helpful in
understanding what's attacking their
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing the actual damage that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into some of the things that
are very common with outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grasshoppers, for example, let's start
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones that things that will
crawl all over your plants and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and eat the leaves and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk to us about grasshoppers,
you know, life cycle and, uh, how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: combat them and things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta be very careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on where you are in the
world, grasshoppers can be, or locusts can
[SPEAKER_00]: be in a massively big problem that,
uh, one particular cultivator is just not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be able to handle very
effectively, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, even in the United States of
America, uh, you know, in most places in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, it would cost millions of
dollars for nations to deal with the
[SPEAKER_00]: damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they use very harsh chemistries and
they still don't have great control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be very generalized
information because there's many different
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of grasshoppers, but they're
incredibly good at dealing with pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and they move in large swarms a lot of
the time as well in bands rather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so grasshoppers, a lot of times
when people are dealing with grasshopper
[SPEAKER_00]: damage, um, I think that the best way to
actually deal with them, if you are in a
[SPEAKER_00]: place where you get a lot of them,
is actually to create sort of a physical
[SPEAKER_00]: barrier, like a mesh screen or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mesh screens work really well for other
things like thrips, if you can get thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: screen and, um, and other sorts of things
like moths that will come in and lay eggs
[SPEAKER_00]: on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mesh screen is good for those pests as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But specifically for grasshoppers,
it's really good because there's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot of things you can do for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grasshoppers, um, the females will,
uh, lay their eggs into soil usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, then, see, you know, in a,
in a season, those nymphs come out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things you can do for them
as they're developing the soil is you can
[SPEAKER_00]: apply something like, uh, nocema,
which is a microsperidian parasite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also apply a certain fungi there
that exists, uh, into the soil as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can kind of damage them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also apply certain chemistries
too, but a lot of times those are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hazards for the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I'm not a huge advocate for it,
but, uh, sometimes it's between you
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding your family and, um, you know,
having to deal with the, the locusts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be a very difficult balance to,
um, to set there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think the physical barriers
are just so much important, but so much
[SPEAKER_00]: more important, especially if you're in a
sort of a smaller space, it's a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: manageable to expect rather than a large
field or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what else is there to say about
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a, I think that that should
be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for sprays, I like to use Buveria
bastiana in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a strain of it called Buveria
bastiana GHA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually stands for grasshopper
active, which a lot of people don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was actually first colonized on,
um, cucumber beetles, but they took it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they reproduce it on grasshoppers a bunch
of times, and now it's very well adapted
[SPEAKER_00]: to grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a big fan of using that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up I have on the list, I group
together caterpillars and inchworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you think those would be
appropriate to group together or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: but can you talk to us a little bit about
caterpillars, inchworms, life cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to battle, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, uh, the Lepidoptera of moths
and butterflies is actually one of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the four biggest insect orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a ton of variation,
but generally speaking, um, it goes like
[SPEAKER_00]: this, a moth or a butterfly will lay an
egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: The egg turns into a caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a caterpillar comes out of the
egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very tiny and it has to grow
really, really quickly and really rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of caterpillars that people deal
with that are pests are pests because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're basically invisible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only eat a little bit of food cause
they're so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as they start to grow,
and this is true for like army worms,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Spodoptera, Helicoverpa, the bud
worms and things like this, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will, it will feed on the plant
leaves and other foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not paying close attention
in a couple of weeks or so, maybe about
[SPEAKER_00]: one week or one week and a half,
uh, all of the larvae are now going to
[SPEAKER_00]: become a larger instar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they eat like a much more massive
amount of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden the decimation tanks
you and you're like, where did this come
[SPEAKER_00]: from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very common complaint with a
lot of these really pestiferous
[SPEAKER_00]: caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feed on cruciferous vegetables and
other things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the caterpillar turns into some
sort of a chrysalis or a pupa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're moths, they tend to,
uh, either they'll wrap around silk and
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and create a pupa in the foliage,
or they might, uh, go to the ground and
[SPEAKER_00]: burrow and create a pupa in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what species you're dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caterpillars and moths can also be very
difficult to identify sometimes if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have, um, either a really
recognizable larval stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like usually an older larva,
but a lot of these things, like you can
[SPEAKER_00]: look it up, uh, they'll have very,
very different morphologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they'll be the same species,
but like one of them will be like a light
[SPEAKER_00]: green with some lines, you know,
and other, and then they'll have another
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype that's like dark black with like
white spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, they're the same species,
but they're like nothing alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be very confusing for people
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same is also true for the adult forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moths can often be, um, different in a
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can cause them some issues
with identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can identify it, if you can go
to an extension agent, or if you're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to look it up yourself, or contact me,
I'm happy to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then that can be something that you
can do to identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can render the appropriate
treatment for them because some larvae,
[SPEAKER_00]: they like to stay on the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some larvae, you like to bore into the
flower material or the fruit material,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, getting a worm in your apple,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really does depend on what you're
growing and what you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if there's something like a burrowing
caterpillar, it likes to get into the stem
[SPEAKER_00]: or the floral tissue, you know,
that's very difficult and also present a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a quagmire because even if you do
kill it somehow, the rotting corpse of
[SPEAKER_00]: that caterpillar is going to foul the rest
of the material in your plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a medicinal plant or whether
it's a fruit bearing plant or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can, again, kind of like what I said
with the grasshopper, sometimes the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the best defense is to not play
the game and to have some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: physical barrier or something like that
that keeps them from laying the eggs on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some larvae do constantly move from
one plant to another plant and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: travel along the ground like those
armyworms I kind of briefly mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but a lot of times that's not the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like what the inchworms are talking
about, they don't make a whole big habit
[SPEAKER_00]: of like moving across the ground because
that's very dangerous for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so in those cases, you know,
I would, I would really say that a
[SPEAKER_00]: physical barrier is really important and
being very vigilant and either picking
[SPEAKER_00]: them off, having chickens, maybe even to
run through can be very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also buy a parasitoid wasps like a
trichogramma, which is an egg parasitoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It parasitized the eggs and then other
ones that parasitize the larvae
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually also some viruses you can
buy, polyhidrosis viruses that are for
[SPEAKER_00]: certain species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only target that species.
[SPEAKER_00]: You apply it on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The caterpillars eat the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, some foliage has to be
eaten, but then it gets into their gut and
[SPEAKER_00]: it destroys them from the inside out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's available for some people as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by and large, the best strategy is to
not be there or not be vulnerable to their
[SPEAKER_00]: presence in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the moths can't get through a
barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned how some can borrow in the
stem and actually borrow themselves in the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one thing if you're leaving
caterpillars on there or inchworms or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, some of them, you know,
take dumps all over your flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're, if you're growing medicinal
varieties and you've got caterpillars all
[SPEAKER_01]: over your buds, well then you've got their
waste on their buds too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to be a smoking waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be a vector for fungal problems
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they create lesions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very difficult thing to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to not have the damage in the
first place, which is easy to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's why preventative measures are
so critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's touch on leaf miners next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you said there's a couple of
different types, you know, whichever type
[SPEAKER_01]: you feel is, is more common that you want
to cover, you know, feel free to cover,
[SPEAKER_01]: but let us know about leaf miners,
their life cycle and how to combat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some moths that are called
leaf miner moths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have a, they just have a
similar style of growing as the fly leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: miners that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the leaf miner flies are actually some
of the first pests I ever dealt with in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a professional capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know all about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The agromisidae are the leaf miner flies,
and they feed on all kinds of things like
[SPEAKER_00]: celery, ornamental flowers, pepper plants,
and also various weedy plants that you
[SPEAKER_00]: might find as you're walking across your
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both the moths and the flies basically
have a similar sort of situation where
[SPEAKER_00]: they lay eggs on the plant or inside the
leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially both of the larvae of both
of these groups will exist within the thin
[SPEAKER_00]: margins between the upper and lower
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they feed, they get bigger and
bigger and create these like long winding
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're in a design,
sometimes it's kind of chaotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: but essentially after a period of time,
the larvae will pupate certain species do
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they pupate outside,
sometimes they pupate inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a fly or a moth will come out of
the pupa and that's how the life cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of want to prevent that from
happening in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're dealing with leaf miner flies,
I like to use something like a parasitoid
[SPEAKER_00]: wasp like a diglyphus z, which is very
commonly used in commercial settings at
[SPEAKER_00]: least.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also, you can also use,
there's a Dacnus, a Sibirica, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: also a parasitoid wasp as well that can be
utilized against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaf miner flies, in my experience,
they often do become resistant to harsh
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistries.
[SPEAKER_00]: In commercial agriculture, it's very
common to utilize systemic pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: against them because they live
systemically in the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my experience, I've actually had
the opportunity to collect samples and
[SPEAKER_00]: then have them tested for resistance to
various common systemic chemistries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've come back with some egregious
levels, like 600 times resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when a resistance level is like
a factor of like 10, they're like 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can swim in that compound and have no
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be very careful that if you use a
chemistry, even like something that's less
[SPEAKER_00]: harsh, it might not be super effective
against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just something to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as treating them though,
yeah, those parasitoids are very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they insert into the leaf,
sometimes they have a hole, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if flies, they oviposit,
they create this little hole when they
[SPEAKER_00]: sting the leaf, as they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that opening can be exploited
with like some of the things I said
[SPEAKER_00]: before, like Isaria fumisaurica is a
fungus that you can apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Buveria fungus I mentioned earlier can
work well and you can sort of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can apply it and the spores get
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get into the tunnel and they can
get into the larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you apply it, sort of an aggressive
rate, I find that it can be also useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, great information for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that, you know, some of
these pests, they're going to leave
[SPEAKER_01]: deposits or waste on the plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some folks, what they'll do on the
medicinal plants is they will,
[SPEAKER_01]: after they harvest, they'll do bud
washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you've heard about what
bud washing is, but basically they'll take
[SPEAKER_01]: their plant and they'll dunk it in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll dunk it into a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's like baking soda and lemon
juice mixed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll dunk it in there, try to get all
the waste off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they'll dunk it in a bucket of plain
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they'll dunk it in another bucket of
plain water, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're trying to get the debris or the
waste off.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts, overall thoughts
on bud washing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I kind of go back and forth on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the one hand, I feel like in some
cases, especially if you're growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, maybe that's a remediation that
is useful for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, I do think that you
might damage some of the medicinal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, constituents for lack of a
better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing that, if you're washing
like fruits and vegetables and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, I think that's actually really
appropriate and useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people do that with great
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if we're dealing with something
like the leaf minor larvae, those sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, that's going to be embedded in the
tissues and much harder to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if you got a lot of like
grass, as they call it on the medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material and things like that,
personally, I mean, I think maybe like
[SPEAKER_00]: shaking it off and things like that can be
useful, but I like to just cut it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, of course that's painful
to say, but I'd rather do that personally
[SPEAKER_00]: than the alternative because I think you
might overall maybe degrade the project,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, the product further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we covered a lot in this podcast
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly didn't cover every single pest
there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to know in the comment section
below, what pest didn't we cover that you
[SPEAKER_01]: would like to see in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matthew, this was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a great general overview of the top
10 pests that could invade your garden and
[SPEAKER_01]: what to do to combat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really appreciate your time today and
the knowledge that you've given both me
[SPEAKER_01]: and my audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us, how can listeners find you and
what do you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I very much appreciate it,
Chris, and I look forward to having
[SPEAKER_00]: another episode with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me at zenthenol.com,
especially for professional inquiries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also find my educational
information in two main places.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is that Zenthenol YouTube
channel where I produce observational
[SPEAKER_00]: footage, pest primer videos about various
pests and other sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did an intro on viroids and with a
particular emphasis on the hot blatant
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid, which you can check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also make a lot of information available
on my Instagram account at Sync Angel,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's S-Y-N-C-H-A-N-G-E-L.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my personal account where I often
have IGTV live streams where I talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: people and my followers about various
things like you and I are right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two major places where I
produce that sort of content for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very excited and I'm honestly humbled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit surreal still after
almost 12 years of doing this that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: able to reach out and help as many people
as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to emphasize that I work
tirelessly on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much a passion of mine to keep
people from being able to deal with pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in situations where the plants
are lacking in support and infrastructure
[SPEAKER_00]: from various groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy that you're also somebody who is
facilitating that information that's
[SPEAKER_00]: crucial for our success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The podcast platforms, particularly Apple
Podcasts, please leave a rating and
[SPEAKER_01]: review.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that helps with spreading
this information as well as leaving that
[SPEAKER_01]: ratings and reviews and of course,
sharing these episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Share with somebody who you think would
benefit from this information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, Matthew, thank you so much for
coming onto this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a fantastic episode,
just jam-packed full of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you and I hope you enjoy the
rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to our mutual success.
See you next time.
