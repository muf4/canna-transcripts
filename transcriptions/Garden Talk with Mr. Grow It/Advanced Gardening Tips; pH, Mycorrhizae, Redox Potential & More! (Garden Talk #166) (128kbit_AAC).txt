[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody, for those of you that
don't know me, my name is Chris,
[SPEAKER_01]: aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned into the
Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode number 166.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode I interview Matt Powers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for 16 years,
and is an author, educator, and a citizen
[SPEAKER_01]: scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has advanced knowledge when it comes to
gardening, and that's what we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get into in today's episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get into a variety of topics,
such as pH, redox potential, mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi, mushroom blocks, the 24-hour light
cycle, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see short clips of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk clips
[SPEAKER_01]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have a gardening channel where I
show the plants that I grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those channels will be linked down
in the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my goals for this podcast is to
bring free information about gardening to
[SPEAKER_01]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode, who help make
[SPEAKER_01]: that goal possible.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back and I'm joined with Matt
Powers.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have been on my list for many,
many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest with you, you're one of
the more advanced folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taken me a while to kind of build up
some knowledge that I'll be able to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: you some more advanced questions,
I feel like, because you do have just a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge, like very extensive background when
it comes to not only teaching,
[SPEAKER_01]: but being an author, educator.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do an introduction here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after that, I'm just going to fire
away some, let's say difficult questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we'll get you some decent questions
here that are going to make you think,
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you introduce yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, for many of us in this space,
John Kemp, when I recently interviewed
[SPEAKER_00]: him, he said this, and I completely
resonated with it, is that many of us got
[SPEAKER_00]: into this because of health crises.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Crohn's and I started trying to eat
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I discovered like organic and stuff right
around the time period when I met my wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was, I was 131 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost 180 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six, almost six, two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was 130 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't really hold onto any muscle,
no fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my wife also got cancer a second year
into our marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when our first born was one years old
and food was the thing I could control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the doctors were liars and they
cause more cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they, then they didn't solve
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they created more cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a real difficult time
because I didn't know what I could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started trying to do the Gerson therapy
and then I just tapped out financially and
[SPEAKER_00]: mentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cause I was the person doing the
juicing and like removing the fibers from
[SPEAKER_00]: the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two years of that, I went crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife was like, please stop,
you know, you're stressing me out more
[SPEAKER_00]: than I think it's helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so I started gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was 140 degree soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm in the foothills above
Fresno.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a bare soil and 112 degree ambient
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't thought it was crazy for
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I had no choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started gardening the initial
year before the animals found it looked
[SPEAKER_00]: really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second year they all found it
and destroyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my father-in-law brought in a
bull manure that wasn't finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all turned into weeds and then great
vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a huge amount of trial and
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all motivated by getting my
kids safe food and my wife food that can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually heal and nourish her and also
food that I could eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really were bound and, and had
really these strictures on our life that
[SPEAKER_00]: forced us into this in many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we feel really blessed in retrospect
because we made all these choices really
[SPEAKER_00]: early on with our kids and our own health
and our own marriage, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, because of our health issues,
we decided to have kids early turning 43
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I have an 18 year old and a 14
year old, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we made these decisions and
gardening was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a fundamental foundational
piece of our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and yeah, it all started with the
health thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you've mentioned, uh, in other videos
that you've filmed, you have a really
[SPEAKER_01]: extensive YouTube channel for those that
haven't checked out his YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have a link in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one of the things I know you for most,
I feel like is the book, this regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: soil book.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my go-to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody is looking for an advanced type
book, highly recommend this book.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is definitely one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made sure I think this one, you sign
this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also have your microscopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Signed on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must've gotten it from me because only
people, uh, people will buy them from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the thing is that's my 23rd
book in the permaculture gardening era of
[SPEAKER_00]: my writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote science fiction books before I
wrote visual music theory books for
[SPEAKER_00]: guitarists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and even before all that in high
school, I wrote like fantasy books.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never finished, but, but I've been
writing and trying to figure this out and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to serve and, and you know,
do all these things as a writer the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people see the success of
that book and they're like, holy cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, that's I'm 10 years
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my 23rd book.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason kept hitting and hitting
until it broke through, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so yeah, no, it definitely was,
uh, an incredible journey to Kurt to get
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was wild because I wrote that
book for gardeners for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then John Kempf really kind of leaned
on me to make it more for farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, Oh yeah, I can figure
out how to generalize and jump out and
[SPEAKER_00]: like, then have it go to scale and bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I did that, I didn't realize the
impact it would have and how, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: stretched the context from small scale to
large scale and then went from micro to
[SPEAKER_00]: macro, how much it would help people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I've got my own interpretation
in its nature, I'm looking at other people
[SPEAKER_00]: saw other things in it than I saw because
I'm simply showcasing nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so it went beyond me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because I focused so much on just
showcasing nature, it allowed people to go
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper than even I, so I learned from my
students.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned from these other farmers who are
using it and applying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been this wild, wild gift that
not just to me in my life, cause it's a,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a best-selling, top-selling book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but also to everyone that has,
has reached and touched and where they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been, been able to apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so yeah, no, I just want to give
context so that it's, it was so much like
[SPEAKER_00]: led up to that moment and, and it,
and it had this power, it transcended so
[SPEAKER_00]: much of what I was doing and hoping to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just, uh, it's just a wonderful
thing, a wonderful thing that happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an incredible book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talk about it all the time in my
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I refer people to it all the time
because it is really that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I'll probably have a link to it
down in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people can easily get to it and check
it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, let's get into some gardening
topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a wide variety of folks in here
as far as experience levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a lot of beginners, intermediate,
probably less advanced folks on here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, just want to give you a heads up
on that right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're aware who the audience is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to start off with pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that the pH in the rhizosphere
can be two points different than the pH in
[SPEAKER_01]: the medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if it's 6.5 pH,
the rhizosphere could actually be 8.5 pH
[SPEAKER_01]: or be 5.5 pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of that, many people are
completely ignoring pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about pH and do you recommend
pH measurements or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I totally recommend pH measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you have to recognize is that they
expend energy to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the energy is protons from
photosynthesis that are used to change the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're expending energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the closer you are to the Goldilocks
range around that route, the more energy
[SPEAKER_00]: you can dedicate to other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those protons can then go to releasing
more nutrients, releasing more things and
[SPEAKER_00]: also energizing the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing to think about is the
roots, the root meristem cells,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are the tip of the root,
that's the most acidic point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the root ages, it becomes more
and more alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so the tip is, is the most acidic and
then it's more alkaline as it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get a gradient effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens essentially is the tip is
where everything happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your root is boring through the soil
and it's actually seeking nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes, like hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it does its whole behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's following the path of least
resistance, following water pathways,
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient pathways, and it's breeding
microbes, sucking them in and removing
[SPEAKER_00]: their nutrition and then pushing the
remaining microbes that survive this
[SPEAKER_00]: process out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they're staying in cause they're
endophytes and they can just release
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's doing that, it's releasing all
this, this energy and it's acidifying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's causing a nutrient release
because it's a differential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, yeah, it's two points
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's that going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to release the nutrients that
are held there comfortably in that pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, not not because you lower the pH,
it's loosening things up and releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a depletion zone following that
tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a wake of depletion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where mycorrhizal fungi,
when partnering it, sends its hyphae out
[SPEAKER_00]: past the depletion zone and gets more
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why partnering with it expands the
actual root zone we talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about it makes it more surface
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expanding past that depletion zone
and sucking in more nutrients and then
[SPEAKER_00]: transforming them and bring them directly
to the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that also changes the pH
relationships further down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have a mycorrhizal
relationship, the gradient is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: much more severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do, it's going to be less so
because it's still going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach past that depletion zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still going to be able to,
to release digestive enzymes and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and solubilize nutrients and
bring them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a little bit more complicated,
you know, of a space than people have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the problem is folks don't think
about time and they don't think in three
[SPEAKER_00]: dimensions and they don't think about
stacking effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people talk about it like, oh,
it's chemical in part, but there's also
[SPEAKER_00]: biological things happening and there's
also electrical things happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you, all these things are happening
all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's hard for people to visualize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why I draw so many pictures
and that's why I separate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put it together in my teaching
so that people will recognize that,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this is all happening in the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like the soil food web conception,
where there's like microbial manures and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they get eaten by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's not happening instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the manure is build up in the soil so
that when the root arrives and depletes
[SPEAKER_00]: that zone, it gets those manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, time, that's like a huge span of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about maybe years to build
up that effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that it's noticeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've got things that are
happening sandwiched right on top of each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like rhizophagy is happening and
mycorrhizal fungi can be doing its thing
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time, which is to a lot of
people are like, but, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, yeah, yeah, they, they, they allow
things to flow through themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it's, it's, it's remarkable and
it's actually visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so roots, they acidify, they're
releasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to remember that it's an,
it's a release of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're creating a differential,
but they also can create that differential
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot less effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're closer to the Goldilocks zone
and, and, and the Goldilocks zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, depending on your plant type
could be very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberries are going to be way more
acidic than your corn when, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be way more acidic than your
beats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you need to know your Goldilocks
zone for what you're planting or you plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in a mix and know that some of these
things are simply, uh, hormesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: hormetic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, like when we work out,
we're stressing the body, but it makes us
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you worked too much way to be like
ripping and hurtful, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a, there's a right level of stress
because we need that differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do cover crops and I mix in some
things like amaranth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix in some things like brassicas and
also have nitrogen fixers and more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more evidence shows that just doing
nitrogen fixers, the whole field of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen fixers is not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that mixture that, that I created
this mix called the five cousins because
[SPEAKER_00]: they kind of all like bully each other a
little bit like cousins do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, that's good for the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like the, the, you know,
the buckwheat stealing nitrogen from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cow peas and the cow peas are going past
their normal expression of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fixation to this genetic full potential
because they're like, it's not piling up
[SPEAKER_00]: properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get this push and pull,
you know, uh, daikon radish sops up all
[SPEAKER_00]: the available nitrogen in the soil so that
the cow peas are like, there's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like going extra hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can create those kinds of
antagonisms and differentiation and all
[SPEAKER_00]: those kinds of things to stimulate things
to a degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have to make things as easy as
possible for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when the plants have discretion and
they have excess funds, they invest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they create those chirpings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They create those, they create the smell
taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: They create all the things that we love
and associate with food are only created
[SPEAKER_00]: at that, like abundance level at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, everything else is taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to smell good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where all the medicinal
qualities happen too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really need to recognize that
the next stage of our growing of making
[SPEAKER_00]: food into medicine of regenerative ag is
getting to that place where we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: stressing plants out past their ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're stressing them out just enough so
that they're like immune system on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're like, we're going to
trigger, you know, their immune system,
[SPEAKER_00]: like ISR, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and we can do that with just applying
microbes that are all that are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like the right kind of stress is
an endo fight that it's already inside it
[SPEAKER_00]: to a small degree, but now we amped it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's at a beneficial degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like probiotics, you know,
for plants, but it triggers them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's in that Goldilocks zone of
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really, I really value all these
paradigms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do test for pH, even though it's a,
it's an average.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you're going to have pH jump four to
nine in most healthy soils, like
[SPEAKER_00]: micrometer to micrometer, but it's,
we're always taking averages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, and I, and I always do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gives us a really good window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're looking at,
at your tests and you've got your parts
[SPEAKER_00]: per million, or you have, you know,
even, even your microbes and your
[SPEAKER_00]: biological testing, the pH gives you so
much context and then reference point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have, you may not test for
redox, but if you know what it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that it's dryer or wetter,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you could be like, wow,
this nutrients being locked out,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added it and the plants not getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I think we need to water more or,
Oh, is the intern watering too much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they usually do too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so you use, you can track
these things down when you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding and pH isn't everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you got to think EH two to
know what's missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, when things don't add up and then pH
is also contextual.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, if you are doing compost and
it's hot compost, please pH test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go, Oh, it's pH eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very high in nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just slow down for a second,
because no one was testing this until I
[SPEAKER_00]: started bringing this up and they're
adding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're, maybe they're at,
they're in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already pH 7.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think adding pH eight is going to
help?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, most of my gardens was
50% compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, ah, you know, they just
shifted their whole garden up to pH 7.8
[SPEAKER_00]: and now everyone's unhappy, you know,
and they're locking on all the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and the nutrients are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's alkaline and oxidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's locked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like really critical to have these
things in our, in our knowledge so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can evaluate things in a way that actually
serves our comprehension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what I teach is allowing people to
see things as they actually are for
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves in such a way that you don't
trust me, bro stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, it's like, if you see this,
you know, then test and you can see in
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you can actually pretty much prove
it to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, not me imposing,
not us imposing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's us asking questions that lead to
answers that we can then test and verify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that, that has been the,
like the, the turning point for me in many
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why this book, I think is so
valuable because we co-create the future
[SPEAKER_00]: together as people read this, cause they
can see and test and see it for themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: and then make decisions based upon what
they know now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been, it's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and the database that I'm creating
now is so that people can see all these
[SPEAKER_00]: things in the open because before people
take actions, they take a test and people
[SPEAKER_00]: take a test at the beginning of the season
to take the action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they eat the thing at the end of the
season and go, we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't test anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do before and after testing with
the actions in the middle so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see what you added, when you added it in
your methodology in real time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then reference to what happened before
and afterwards and then how that be
[SPEAKER_00]: ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gardeners, market gardeners,
small farmers, midsize and large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers can see the gradient of
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can see also like, they can kind
of see the future too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like looking at this market
gardeners applying regenerative methods
[SPEAKER_00]: that they haven't figured out how to scale
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, ah, and the people who
figure that out will be, and that's viral.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want things to become viral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it, it really goes back to just a
simple idea that when we have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: information and we look through the lens
of nature, things become self evident and
[SPEAKER_00]: people make really good decisions,
uh, because people then are empowered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, when people have the right,
people have the right lenses and ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to critically think and the right
information sets, they make really good
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's always been my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm really trying to stay out of the
way and let nature do the talking and the
[SPEAKER_00]: showcasing and the speaking for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are things I've discovered
in microscopy that I haven't said publicly
[SPEAKER_00]: yet, and I'm letting my students discover,
uh, and, and they're all like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm like, yeah, I know, but this is
part of the reason why I want the database
[SPEAKER_00]: because then everyone's going to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all going to go wait because
that's how we really cause massive change,
[SPEAKER_00]: big change and fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, you know, that's, that's kind
of like the larger vision around all that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really interesting stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned redox and EH,
and I feel like that's something that we
[SPEAKER_01]: should get deeper into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think a lot of people really talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is soil redox potential and how can
gardeners manage it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if we go back to high school
chemistry, we remember redox or maybe some
[SPEAKER_00]: of us don't remember high school chemistry
and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Redox is a combination of two words,
reduction and oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reveals a fundamental truth about life
on earth and all life in biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look up oxidative stress,
it's the underlying symptom that leads to
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, cancer, all, all illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: All diseases are linked to inflammation
and inflammation is oxidative stress or
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're like, whoa, why,
what is oxidative stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is oxidation?
[SPEAKER_00]: How, why is it inflammation?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we take a piece of wood and we light
fire to it and it combusts, it is flame,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's oxidizing the wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oxidation is the liberation of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oxidized food would be dried out food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, and then an oxidized soil is dried
out soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the energy has been lost and,
and, and, and water is also, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: in many ways functions as, as energy or a
storage of energy, uh, for so many things
[SPEAKER_00]: in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about photosynthesis as one
input, um, light into photosynthesis as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about photosynthesis as one
input, water is the other, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing hydrolysis and they're releasing
protons energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to recognize that oxidation is
the loss of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means reduction, despite it
sounding like we're reducing something mad
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction is the gain in energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the chemistry folks, you know,
they like to confuse us and have their own
[SPEAKER_00]: little ivory tower of comprehension and
confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, many, many different branches of
science do this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Language is a way that back, you know,
hundreds and thousands of years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would keep people out of your special
circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they have done is made it so that
people don't realize that their bodies are
[SPEAKER_00]: energy-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the drop in energy in our bodies that
leads to cancer and all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why Dr. Zach Bush, when he tests
for people and their health, he's testing
[SPEAKER_00]: the charge on the outside of their cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's testing the redox potential of the
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how he's telling how healthy
they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So energy is fundamental to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, if you go back 50 years ago,
icing the body electric, um, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: was energy based and there's all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then suddenly all these people came
into that area of new discovery and became
[SPEAKER_00]: very woo woo around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then created this kickback reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and then it became something that
knew all energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, no one talks about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's pseudoscience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, all the chemists know energy is
how everything is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the charges on the outside of
every nutrient element is actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: combination lock piece that fits into each
reaction inside the plant is the charge
[SPEAKER_00]: difference that creates the possibility,
the ability for it to finish that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything is energy based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So redox is the gain and loss of energy
and the potential to, to, to, to,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is the holding of the energy and also
the potential to exchange energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so if it's oxidized, well,
there's not much energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can't exchange much energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already been lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's, it's already been
burned, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There, there, there, it's, you know,
it's, it's action.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lost all that BTU, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All that potential burning energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really what we're talking
about is the actual energetic possibility
[SPEAKER_00]: and potential of your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's what I've already said is it's
linked to moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your soils are all dried out and
oxidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be lacking in energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this doesn't mean that it's,
um, all alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Montana, Idaho, and Eastern
Washington, you're going to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: aluminum and you're going to have things
in the soil that are going to mineral wise
[SPEAKER_00]: be acidic, but it's all dried out high,
high desert and all that makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: oxidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that's a more difficult
environment, no doubt, because as you draw
[SPEAKER_00]: it down the pH, you start loosening things
and releasing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be a lot more, um,
soil organic matter, a lot more buffering,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you need to be testing your pH
regularly so that you don't dip too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and, and you stay in that goalie
lock zone in that situation, the hot
[SPEAKER_00]: compost that's pH eight is exactly what
you need, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To keep it in the goalie lock zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very, very personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very specific to our climate when we're
talking about EH and pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a long time, I taught because my
original mentor, you know, Elaine Ingham
[SPEAKER_00]: taught that there's this, there's this
line of succession between the desert and
[SPEAKER_00]: old growth forest, but that's actually a
diagonal through an XY pH, EH chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been teaching just a bandwidth of
truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's true, but all those Montanans and
Idahoans and Washington folk were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what the heck is wrong with my soil
then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it made no sense to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so it's really important to
understand your situation from both pH and
[SPEAKER_00]: EH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when you put them together,
you go, Oh, I see where I am actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why that's that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're doing testing for
minerals and you're super high in aluminum
[SPEAKER_00]: or super high in something else,
you know, that's causing antagonism.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's causing alkaline alkaline,
uh, states.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cause we got limestone bedrock
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, when it rains, it's like,
and you flood the field, you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: alkalinizing effect actually, because it,
all that acidity then combines with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the limestone below and the limestone
goes, well, there's a lot more of me than
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's re re lowers your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we have to recognize these effects
are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: These effects are trackable, but these
effects are also, you can deal with them
[SPEAKER_00]: because like you said at the beginning,
you need to be worrying about the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: around your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you added things in the root zone?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what a lot of people are doing
that are acidifying in the root zone that
[SPEAKER_00]: give the plant the energy it needs to to
change it itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so there's a lot of options on how
to do that, but the reason we pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to redox, the wetness and
dryness of the site is we can easily go
[SPEAKER_00]: too far in both directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on where we are,
it's going to release completely different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so understanding where you are tells
you what dangers you have and where to
[SPEAKER_00]: push and when, and then what techniques
will work best for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You explain that better than I think
anybody has ever explained it to me
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you, you mentioned a little bit about
mycorrhizal fungi, and I'd be willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: bet that the folks listening in,
there's, there's gotta be over 50% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people are supplementing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're adding in some mycorrhizal fungi
into the medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a lot of the grow home growers
here that are tuning in majority are home
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, indoors versus outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that being said, you hear a lot of
people talking about the application of
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're using a product, it's often
said that sprinkling it directly onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone during transplant is the best
way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard people saying that it's
significantly less effective to mix those
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes into water, mycorrhizal fungi
into water, and then do a soil drench with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, is it less efficient doing it that
way versus sprinkling directly into roots
[SPEAKER_01]: or what's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have more information that is going
to provide a new way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way the microbes work with seeds is
they, they, they partner immediately with
[SPEAKER_00]: the root coming out and then they stay in
tandem with the root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just like, think about surface
area and application.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take the seed and some of you are
going to be doing tiny seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like big pea seeds or bean seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing a tiny seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the surface area and
requirement of mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycorrhizal fungi and realize that if it's
there, when it begins, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So giving them the initial microbes then
is the smartest move because you use the
[SPEAKER_00]: least amount product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now imagine you have these already grown
roots and you're putting, trying to dust
[SPEAKER_00]: these things on them and you've got a
speck here, a speck here, a speck here,
[SPEAKER_00]: a speck here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those could, they'll go in and do
their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not spores and if it's a
propagules, which is sections of root that
[SPEAKER_00]: are inoculated from last year,
that's effective, not spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spores will germinate when they want to
and spores are in case we get ice ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in case everything goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to put propagules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mycoapply, mycomax, mycos by extreme
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are three that I know that do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to start from there,
there and there and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it starts at the point of contact and
then spreads out from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have powdered, like the wettable
powder, WP, mycos from extreme garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you just take mortar and pestle to
like your, your, your, uh, pelletized
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and then add it on, then your seeds
are going to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all going to just immediately
bond with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's going to keep pace with it
as it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to become this big old
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, how much did you actually spend
per plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very, very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it just coated the seeds and this
goes with all your microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about inoculating with the
endophytes that can reproduce inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant because they're feeding off
photosynthetic sugars and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes in and, and so, so they're
actually completing photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're replicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we add these in initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're doing lactic acid bacteria,
that's an endophyte that also stimulates
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're partnering with all these
different things and they're there the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about, it's about timing and it's
about like being able to visually verify
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can just.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people don't have this yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my students do, but I can just
turn on that light, that little blue
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can see that it's, that's bound
to the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could take five, five of my seeds
inoculating with the powder, put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: a, a jerk, like a do a germination test,
put them in a folded over napkin or paper
[SPEAKER_00]: towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's damp inside a plastic Ziploc bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not fully closed on a warm surface
and let it germinate and look at them
[SPEAKER_00]: under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see that they fully take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can verify this for myself that yeah,
Matt is telling the truth because,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what this is the kind of
science I like because then everyone else
[SPEAKER_00]: can verify it for themselves and go,
yeah, I've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the kind of ground we all can
stand on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can put the images on the
database and then have that replication
[SPEAKER_00]: play out in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the people who have paid more
money than my programs who have cognitive
[SPEAKER_00]: dissonance and cannot let go, they'll be
able to let go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause though I have seen people literally
look at things and go, yeah, but how do
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, right, but you could
have made that picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh dear, because the reality
is it's like, we can all just go look.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of people, I mean,
we live in a day and age where there are
[SPEAKER_00]: people that see things right in front of
their face and can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of that's the food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think part of it's cognitive dissonance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've invested in a way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've invested in a methodology or a
program that they paid more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also see it playing out all over in
science and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to create things that are
self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evident and also so that people can move
forward with confidence, improvising and
[SPEAKER_00]: innovating in such a way that the science
moves forward in a viral way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, I mean, if you think about
automobile, that's how it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a thousand different
automobiles before the, the model T
[SPEAKER_00]: emerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in that innovation and that
back and forth that really citizen
[SPEAKER_00]: science, you know, that created that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now we're the product,
all of us are the products of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the indoor growers for 30, 40 years
doing the R and D that we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: benefiting from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it was citizen science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it was people doing the work and
then sharing it, you know, in these,
[SPEAKER_00]: these forums with secret names and
everything, you know, for years getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that feedback loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's all I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's all I'm modeling it
afterwards is allowing that natural
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback loop, that natural replication
science and that viral velocity to quote
[SPEAKER_00]: Brendan, my friend Richard, to actually
foment change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that's, you know, that's,
that's, that's what's happening and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're, you're basically saying you
coding the seed before germination is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they're doing the paper towel
method, they could just put the seed on
[SPEAKER_01]: the paper towel, sprinkle a little bit of
mycorrhizal fungi on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll then germinate and they can plant
that directly in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what if they, I wouldn't,
I wouldn't do that for like my planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would do that to verify that my
mycorrhizal fungi that I bought is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also proves to ourselves that it
stays in tandem as it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, once it's inoculated,
it's inoculated, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's how all the plants evolved
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being able to see that and verify
that a tells you this is something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then B, I'm going to be able to
inoculate all my seeds this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you germinate a seed and then just
dip that taproot in mycorrhizal fungi and
[SPEAKER_01]: then plant it, that's perfectly
acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then would you recommend, it's not
recommended to do any mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_01]: applications after that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it kind of grows with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do is I would actually not,
because I mean, they're so sensitive with
[SPEAKER_00]: those, those emerging roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mess with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would do is I would do a soak of
the seed with mycorrhizal fungi and
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes like effective microbes at EM
or the equivalent, which is yeast,
[SPEAKER_00]: propelled on sulfur bacteria and
lactidized bacteria would do those three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you would soak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it would be soaked up into the
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed would have nutrients and have
microbes and all this stuff happening all
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I mean, with EM there's some
leftover, you know, carbon from the
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it soaks that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has that extra energy and potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you plant that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after like, you know, like an hour to
six out, this is a smaller seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would do an hour to two hours of
soaking, maybe max two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would observe different, different seeds
are going to behave different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger the seed, the longer the soak,
the smaller the seed, the shorter the
[SPEAKER_00]: soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would soak it in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would, so what I do is I pour
off the excess and then a lot of this
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculants heavier, especially if you let
it settle for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's at the bottom, like a slurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would mix it with the seeds and
it would like subtly scarify the seeds a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, you know, cause a little bit
grit to that and get that all deeper and
[SPEAKER_00]: embedded and coded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would plant those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, and you're like, Oh Matt,
well, you know, I'm doing a large farm and
[SPEAKER_00]: can I just add it as a powdered amendment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my rhizobia?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can totally do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's totally okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though you want it to stick as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe adding a little bit of water or a
little bit of binder or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe something that's damp, maybe
something like, like compost or something
[SPEAKER_00]: as a carrier that'll keep it in contact
with the seeds so that it goes in
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of us, if we're doing small
scale, we're doing plantings that are
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be babying our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've paid a lot for these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're, you can do that slurry and
then you can plant them individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, doing the testing on your
mycorrhizal fungi before you, you use it
[SPEAKER_00]: on everything proves to yourself,
a that you made the right purchase and
[SPEAKER_00]: then B that this is going to be a good
inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for breaking down the details on
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, uh, good actionable advice for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to flip it up and talk about
something, which I believe I heard on
[SPEAKER_01]: either Instagram or your YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was in regards to mushroom blocks,
like oyster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had mentioned that it actually kills
off beneficial nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pissed off so many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so the reality is there are papers
where they're deworming cattle and sheep
[SPEAKER_00]: with oyster mushroom, mycelium and oyster
mushroom blocks with, which are mycelium,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my idea was like, Oh, this is a
natural dewormer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is awesome because the effects of
this are temporary.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened was people that didn't
understand the science around it got
[SPEAKER_00]: really mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually had a person that used to
be a friend freak out and kind of lose
[SPEAKER_00]: their minds because they thought I was
assaulting their business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they, they do mushroom block gardens
and it was super upsetting because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, they don't, they didn't even hear
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then it became this weird thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so I don't know if it was,
this was like a thing that they attacked
[SPEAKER_00]: because of other things in their life,
but it was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they basically got so upset because
they felt like I was saying that the
[SPEAKER_00]: oyster mushrooms are going to destroy
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is oyster mushrooms,
you know, when you add them to the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: will kill all the nematodes that it comes
in contact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the same with reishi.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same with turkey tail,
like a bunch of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not talking out of school.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is already published and well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just was sharing the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like invent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was shocking in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it was like, they're not even
reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I literally posted, like after I
said that in the next post, another
[SPEAKER_00]: article showing that within days and up to
like a week, you have that die off being
[SPEAKER_00]: replaced by a flush of beneficial
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the session.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like when we like clear the slate
the right way, beneficials come back and
[SPEAKER_00]: not, you know, like using chemical
steroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sterilizers causes bad things to come
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do a biological reset,
you have good biology come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I, I was really bothered by,
by their attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because I, you know, I've been trying
for years to help this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, and so it just was something that
I put out there because it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be deworming your animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can be using a microscope and a
hemocytometer and checking their stool to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that you deworm them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can verify with the same
microscope that those soils go through
[SPEAKER_00]: that dip and come out the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I was showing something that I knew
that people, if they just took the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: could verify, could follow and then could
do confidently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what, you know, my good friends,
um, like, uh, angel shots who literally
[SPEAKER_00]: has given out thousands of these blocks,
heard me say the first part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she literally was like, that's
awesome, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never knew that and had no qualms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing was upsetting to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: So central Texas, my college has been
giving out these blocks, but she knows the
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she knew because of her experience
that it was okay, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and so then when I followed up with
that second article, she was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: ha, that's what we're seeing on our end,
you know, because she's in, she's in my
[SPEAKER_00]: college.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's looking at all these things with
open eyes and allowing nature to speak to
[SPEAKER_00]: her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, it is the case that they do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the case that we can replace all
this dewormer that people are using,
[SPEAKER_00]: which hilariously enough is often
Ivermectin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so we can use oyster mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And replace all that, uh, and get our
animals manure to a place where we can use
[SPEAKER_00]: in compost again, you know, cause some
people are using deworm compost and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: ruining their compost and they're all
freaked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do incredible things with
natural modalities, but so much of it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, not letting hysteria fear or just like
unbridled, uh, optimism, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that people generally generalize like
the wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, we gotta contextualize the wins
so that we see the caveats, the ranges of
[SPEAKER_00]: expression and also just the limitations,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I definitely brought that up and I
definitely, uh, saw wild reactions to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you know, it was, it was sobering
because I mean, yeah, they said crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were saying that I was stealing them,
the microbes with the microscope by seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: them and naming them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, no, actually someone
already has named all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just seeing who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, so it's, uh, it's,
it's quite a world we live in,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people who are freaking
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that, um,
need, need to go out in nature and
[SPEAKER_00]: meditate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing with content creation
where it's, yeah, you do your best to
[SPEAKER_01]: share good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be valuable people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's always that somebody who takes
spins and turns into something negative
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you get attacked for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, that's part of the job,
I guess.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a high school English teacher and
I've seen it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and most of the time the attacks
really just are reflections on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: person and the hardship that they're going
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, uh, like this person I'm talking
about, I wish them nothing but good
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I really hope that, uh, the animosity
drains.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, switching it up a little bit here,
I want to get your thoughts on the 24 hour
[SPEAKER_01]: light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have so many folks out there that
they want to get, you know, grow plants
[SPEAKER_01]: faster, get a better result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're putting their indoor plants on
24 hours of light and zero hours of
[SPEAKER_01]: darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the nighttime when, uh, you know,
lights are off, that's when sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: transportation happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question for you is, does it happen
less with that 24 hour light cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore negatively impacting plant
growth at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we have to remember that,
um, there's a wide range of plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant expression, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, there are some plants that are
going to grow really well in the land of
[SPEAKER_00]: the midnight sun, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they're going to have mechanisms
that allow them to just keep going and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we're also, we also have
respiration, plants respire, and they only
[SPEAKER_00]: do that when they're resting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my instinct is that you'll get
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're going to get different
relationships of microbes and different,
[SPEAKER_00]: different like, uh, terpenes and different
medicinal qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: From both these methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see side by sides and full
workups on like the parts per million on
[SPEAKER_00]: the phenolics, the terpenes, all those
things, uh, to really, to really say,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to probably have
differences in expression and in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: like where the plants from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say you're growing a certain
plant from like the Himalayas,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to behave very differently
from like the same family from Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and those genes do exist in strains,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I've seen in practice with
people doing indoor grows from them,
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing things to like the artificial
light cycles, um, they're all trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: imitate or short cut nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we do light depth?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do light depth because we're trying to
imitate the end of the season when there's
[SPEAKER_00]: less light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we take that as the,
as the guiding principle, you got to do
[SPEAKER_00]: what's most natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that's the principles behind
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally asked what's most natural,
how did nature originally do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and, and whenever we see amazing
plants, um, and we're obviously talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about a specific amazing plant,
um, there's abilities of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of blow our minds, but what's
best for the plan and what creates the
[SPEAKER_00]: best product is really the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant can do crazy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for instance, Canadian growers,
when I talked to, you know, Joy Beckerman
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy, uh, she's the reason that the fiber
cousin of the plant we're talking about is
[SPEAKER_00]: legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was the lawyer who fought the federal
government sponsored by you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: John Rulak's Nativa so that they could do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, she had me talking to Canadian growers
and they're, they, they figured out that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no ceiling on nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're raising the synthetic nitrogen
higher and higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants are getting bigger and
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cause they don't care about the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only care about the fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, well, no one's going to eat
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it doesn't matter if it's high in
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter that it's like an animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter that it never left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetative state and went, didn't go to
reproductive and didn't form seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just like throwing it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the soil is a desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're destroying the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole narrative around like,
well, the soil will be saved by this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no, not the way they're
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not industrial industrial growers in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're modeling for Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so we have to recognize that there
are aspects where you can abuse the
[SPEAKER_00]: system, but is that good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like, yeah, you get two years
where it's like phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your soil is dead and then they
have to rotate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go to this thing,
which is so depressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is most of the Pacific Northwest
is most of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, we'll come back in three
years and farm it like abusively again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we won't be able to do it for
another three years, but then we'll do it
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they leave it fallow and they let
it, let it go and they show back up and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they didn't abuse it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they like leave it for three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, they could be farming that
patch of land every year and having the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil improve their products improve and
their bottom line improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that's really like a lot of what
I'm doing is getting people to recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: the holistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Involved and to be able to see and
understand the longevity of their
[SPEAKER_00]: operation because yeah, there,
there, there's, there's plenty of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we could do that could stretch it
this way or that way, or, or push things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but asking what's most natural
has a holistic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if we're not burning our soil,
you could amend and then use that soil
[SPEAKER_00]: again, or you could treat it and ferment
and use that soil again, like a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do, um, you could even dump them
all in the backyard, amend it,
[SPEAKER_00]: tarp it, ferment it, and then use it all
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a bunch of things that
people can do, uh, that they're not doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so that's, that's really my instinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I hear like that, like, can we go all
the way?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, plants are pretty
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wanting to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, we can do like these hoops and
make them do these weird things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, they have plants now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like imitating plastic leaves,
you know, and they're like, the plant can
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, yeah, the plant can see
because it's trying to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you know, we're, we're
torturing things to see how far they can
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, we're doing all this stuff
instead of saying like, what would be best
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plant and letting that speak to us
and looking at what that actually looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when a plant's super healthy,
it's going to actually invest in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a plant's super healthy partner
with mycorrhizal fungi, it actually leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: the hyphal, uh, the hyphal expression of
the fungi around the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have like this lipid rich hyphae
that's just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what becomes the inoculant when
that root dies for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a new root touches it,
it inoculates the new root.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens in hard times is the plant
actually reabsorbs that and it eats the
[SPEAKER_00]: lipids as energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause lipids are like the best form of
energy, the longest lasting form of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's fats, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an investment in the mycorrhizal
fungi that they can liquidate in times of
[SPEAKER_00]: stress, or they can pass on to their
children next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause who's going to be growing in the
soil of their root zone, most likely their
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, their children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants, when they have enough are going
to do things that are going to enrich the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, going to have secession and,
and, and, and regenerative quality so that
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes happens the next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbes are preserved for next year
and passed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to do things that we can't
do, or we don't want to spend the money,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and the time doing, and they're
just going to do it for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so that when I hear that and I
think about that, that's really what I see
[SPEAKER_00]: is like what we should shift to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reusing the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, that's something I've been
reusing the same soil now for seven grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, ever since I started
really getting into organics and realized
[SPEAKER_01]: that it is possible to reuse over and over
again, I have been, and I've been saving
[SPEAKER_01]: so much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been, has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping on that topic, when you kind of
re-enrich your soil with minerals,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into your recommendations a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What minerals do you recommend gardeners
use to replenish their soils?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you recommend things like rock dust,
seaweed, compost, manure?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your general recommendations?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you should get a soil test and see
what is missing from your soil and then
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking about the types of
minerals, what do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also what should growers avoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a few different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, someone just in Florida recently
figured out how to remove arsenic from
[SPEAKER_00]: seaweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the fears around like arsenic
buildup in our soil, because we're using
[SPEAKER_00]: seaweed, uh, we're going to be able to
figure out in the void, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like seaweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think about lead zeppelin, rubber
plant, you know, mountains flow into the
[SPEAKER_00]: sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where all the minerals have
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so bringing those back is really
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like ocean minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea of farming the coastline
to bring the eutrophication down and then
[SPEAKER_00]: return those nutrients to the soil in such
a way that sticks this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, I, I really, I really like that
cycle because it permaculturally it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: the bioregional solution, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had all this runoff, all this
phosphate nitrogen fertilizer from all the
[SPEAKER_00]: lawns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually right there killing things
in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, coastal Florida,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, if we just do vertical
farming, we just do seaweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed farming, uh, crustacean farming,
you know, those things can be turned into
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and not only that it can be done
in such a DIY way, Korean natural farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we can do all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so I really like that as a
modality and as a generalized system for
[SPEAKER_00]: fixing a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like rock dust, but with the caveat that
if you don't look at what's on your rock
[SPEAKER_00]: dust test, you may be adding a lot of
aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dan Kittredge years ago said,
whatever local rock dust you have is the
[SPEAKER_00]: best rock dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, not in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had too many students, uh,
and I've seen too many examples of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of, of local areas that are just like,
no, you know, you may want to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: something else in, uh, and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's knowing that moving forward with
open eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is the most critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at the test readouts and different
kelps, different seaweeds are from
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas and they have totally
different readouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I would look at those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and, you know, depending on what
you're growing, if it's a heavy feeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be doing, you know, I really like
bunny manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bunny manure has been like the gold,
you know, and so many operations that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: done, I've been like, where's the local
FFA or FAA instructor who's doing rabbits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because it's like, they have the best
manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, of course you got to monitor what
they're eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta know what they're eating and
what they're giving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but man, I, I, in terms of manure,
goat and bunny manure, cause it's cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not already hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marco microbes, Marco's microbes
originally talked about how he loves it
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think that's a great, great,
great usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, great, great amendment, but in
general, uh, other than like those minimum
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal mineral kind of amendments,
I really rely upon microbes because so
[SPEAKER_00]: much of the nutrients that we want are
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not solubilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to solubilize them is
either crazy extremes with pH or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, or you just simply have
microbes and the microbes are mining it
[SPEAKER_00]: and unlocking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And solubilizing it, transporting it,
transforming it, and that autonomy that we
[SPEAKER_00]: give to the microbes and the plant and the
soil microbes, it creates this economy
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that ends up feeding things better
than, and, and at such a rate and
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity that we can't imitate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like seaweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like rock dust with a caveat that if we
don't look, we don't see, and we can
[SPEAKER_00]: easily get bitten.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some good recommendations there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Matt, this talk has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure we could go on for
another two hours if we really wanted to,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're going to wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell listeners how they can find
you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the site, regenerative
soilscience.com, it'll have, and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: type that in as a lead link.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I'm not super sophisticated on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured out like lead links,
um, and they all lead to my courses and
[SPEAKER_00]: all my stuff on the Kajabi platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got like 15 online courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, you know, over 24 different
books, but regenerative soilscience.com is
[SPEAKER_00]: the place to start with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a place to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next month, I'm going to be starting
regenerative soil microscopy, the new
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the month after that, we'll be
starting regenerative soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both those are open though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could hop in and take it self-paced
and then you have lifetime access to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could join us at any point this
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be doing an advanced
permaculture student online session as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this stuff where I'm zooming out
and talking bioregionally and talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about all these kinds of things,
that kind of thinking started there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is advanced permaculture student
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you could check that out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but if you just type my name in Matt
powers into Google, not being for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, but Google, you'll just see the
whole first page is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you can find me at Matt power
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: On Instagram, on Twitter, and,
uh, just type in Matt powers on YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll find me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have a link to your
YouTube channel, since this is being
[SPEAKER_01]: posted on YouTube down in the description
section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people can easily get to it and want to
give a big thanks to the folks on Patreon,
[SPEAKER_01]: patreon.com slash mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow it a hundred percent of what is
donated through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go right back on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks that are being scrolled on the
screen now are in the producer tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Special thanks to you, Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for coming on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have learned quite a bit and this is one
that I'm going to replay over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: again to continue to try to grasp this
information and hard code it into my
[SPEAKER_01]: brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, like I mentioned, we could
continue on the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm going to do is ask the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see a part two with Matt,
drop it down in the comment section below,
[SPEAKER_01]: put part two, and then maybe, uh,
maybe we can get him back on here to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to continue the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for tuning in and I'll
catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out.
