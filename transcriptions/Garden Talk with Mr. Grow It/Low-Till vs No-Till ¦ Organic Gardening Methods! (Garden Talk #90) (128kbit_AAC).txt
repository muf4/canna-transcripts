[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just basically touching the top of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that will do is that will
incorporate all those amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll get rid of all those weed seeds that
have germinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also will allow us to have soil
contact with our Korean natural farming
[SPEAKER_01]: input.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil health that we have on the farm,
indigenous microorganisms or IMO,
[SPEAKER_01]: is our very best friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are buying all these bottles of
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call them bugs in a jug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great, but it's very limited
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out in nature, you can pick up a teaspoon
of soil and with that teaspoon of soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are literally thousands of different
species of microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Korean natural farming has that
microbiology diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That diversity of soil biology allows
those plants to uptake nutrients that are
[SPEAKER_01]: harder to get normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That allows it for it to be a stronger,
healthier plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode number 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Wendy
Kornberg of Sunabyss.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been gardening all her life and is
a licensed cultivator in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does low-till farming and also a lot
of natural farming techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: She talks about low-till farming and how
it differs from no-till farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as other techniques that she does
on her farm.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Wendy Kornberg of
Sunabyss.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to get into low-till
farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have heard of no-till
farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low-till, something kind of new here,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like more and more growers are
going towards no-till, but low-till is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you're going to give us the
rundown on because you have experience on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'd like to get into what
you do in your garden, on your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, what I want to do, which I do
with all guests, is an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Wendy Kornberg, and I run
Sunabyss Humboldt's Full Sun Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a small family farm that grows
mostly medicinal plants on the banks of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Eel River in southern Humboldt County
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically grew up gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really remember a time in my life
that I haven't had something growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did find when I went to college and
lived in an apartment for a while that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not the best at growing house plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed to kill a fern.
[SPEAKER_01]: I managed to kill a ficus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the plants that you're
supposedly not able to kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I got orchids and found out that
those work very well for me because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think I was killing them literally with
kindness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was paying too much attention to the
plants, and orchids are supposed to die
[SPEAKER_01]: after they bloom, or so I was told.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had bought some, and they bloomed very
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I ignored them, and they didn't die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went, oh, maybe this is my key.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, other than that, basically my
family growing up, my mother had about a
[SPEAKER_01]: one-acre garden, including orchard trees
and some grapevines and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was always what I considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: A garden is a decent amount of square
footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all substance food for our family
for the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom would grow a lot of tomatoes and do
a bunch of canning of spaghetti sauce and
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato sauces and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We often dried fruit, so we would have
dried apples and things through the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a root cellar, so potatoes,
onions, all that stuff, canned peaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you name it, we would try and
grow it and figure out how to save it over
[SPEAKER_01]: the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening all your life, lots and lots of
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 years of gardening, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all your life?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 20 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't garden when I was two,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No-till gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people know what that is,
but I have a lot of beginners that listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to this podcast, a lot of beginners and
intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some people that might not know
what no-till is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about what no-till is,
and also what low-till is, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between the two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to preface this, we tilled my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom every year would wait for my dad to
get the huge BCS rototiller that was
[SPEAKER_01]: always on its last legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember as a kid, it was so loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: She would spread a lot of chicken manure
and some other soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we usually used oyster shell,
a little bit of green sand, maybe some Cal
[SPEAKER_01]: Foss or soft Foss or something along those
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then my dad would come through with the
BCS and just till through all the beds,
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple passes, and my mom would plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the way that I learned how to
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I started gardening and farming on
my own, I quickly realized that tillage is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, A, I didn't have a rototiller,
so I had to rent one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're expensive where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm five foot two and weighed at the time
when I started about 120 pounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: so trying to mangle one of those beasts
into doing what I wanted it to do was
[SPEAKER_01]: always a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started looking into no-till,
which means you literally do not till the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of ways, it's really,
really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also utilize Korean natural farming,
which benefits from no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem we came into over and over
again is that, number one, if you let your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil lay fallow or get bare at any point
in time where you're not cultivating crops
[SPEAKER_01]: on it, our soil gets very hard and compact
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rain will literally pound the soil
into a cement brick.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, in order to break that up
again, you can do things like broad
[SPEAKER_01]: forking, which is basically a big,
huge, imagine a giant fork that you pound
[SPEAKER_01]: into the ground and then you lean back
until your soil cracks open.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way to protect the microbiology and
protect your soil, but unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, the soil would be so hard,
I literally couldn't even get a broad fork
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be jumping up and down on it and
falling over and it just wasn't working
[SPEAKER_01]: for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an option that is a no-till
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do no-till lasagna bed methods,
which is really cool as well if you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: a small square footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can utilize cardboard, which smothers
the weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It suppresses any weed germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can put compost and soil and
things on top of that and then mulch on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of that and you can plant in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great way to garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that in small scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Utilizing maybe what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess those beds are three feet by 20
feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could do that easily on my own,
but it does take a lot of cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does take some time and energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inevitably, because I live out in the
country, we have weed seeds that are
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly blowing back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to redo it basically every year
to smother those weeds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't working very well for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover crop is great to try and suppress
the weeds, but inevitably, our farm is
[SPEAKER_01]: 18,000 square feet of medicinal plants as
well as another 2,000 currently for
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable crops just on the farm itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be expanding that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were trying to expand it this year,
but we just didn't have the time and
[SPEAKER_01]: manpower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at basically a half an acre to
three-quarters of an acre, we're hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: up to an acre by next year of total
cultivated square footage, but that's run
[SPEAKER_01]: by myself, my fiance, James, and my mom
who is 73 years old and we have five kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot to work with just a very,
very small amount of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've definitely been trying to get people
on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of people that come and
volunteer for a few days here and there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when you hit those crunch times of
it's time to get the soil prepped and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: time to get planted, we quickly find that
we usually run out of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've turned to that works for us is
a low till situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, when you're using a tiller,
what you're doing is you're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivating the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're turning it and you're grinding it
up and you're doing that at some pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: deep levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most tillage recommends 12 to 18 inches,
if not deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you get a really good bed of
really soft soil that your plants don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to work to get their roots through.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with this is all the
microbiology that exists in that soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully you're working with soil and not
dead dirt, so hopefully you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: biology in there, it gets turned up to the
surface and it gets mangled and pulverized
[SPEAKER_01]: and what ends up happening is it dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that microbiology dies, number one,
you're losing diversity of microbiology in
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil, which means that you're losing
plant health inevitably or you're having
[SPEAKER_01]: to replace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times people are buying all these
bottles of microbes, we call them bugs in
[SPEAKER_01]: a jug.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great, but it's very limited
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out in nature, you can pick up a teaspoon
of soil and within that teaspoon of soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are literally thousands of different
species of microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best jugs I've come across have
between 20 and 40 species.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the same thing at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've tilled appropriately,
you've turned all your microbiology up to
[SPEAKER_01]: the surface, they've died back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real detriment to this is they have
now actually created carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the carbon dioxide that we deal
with nowadays is not coming from driving
[SPEAKER_01]: or flying or producing tires or things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it is actually industrial tillage
of commercial cultivation of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a great practice on a lot of
levels, but what do you do when you have
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's like, okay, I have an
acre that I'm running.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have an acre worth of cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like silage tarps and it's not
working for me because seeds are blowing
[SPEAKER_01]: in every single time of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not dandelions in the spring,
then it's foxtails in the summer and then
[SPEAKER_01]: it's lamb's quarter in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've turned to is what we call low
till.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that we're not tilling deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're literally just tilting the top inch
or two of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This allows us to get our nutrients in
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're using something like compost or
chicken manure or if we want to put out
[SPEAKER_01]: some rock dust, we can actually
incorporate that into the top layer of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil gently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It loosens that soil bed so that our seed
bed is nice and soft so that our plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are easy to transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're transplanting, our seeds are able
to germinate and take root easily if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: germinating seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also allows us to cultivate the weed
seeds that have germinated and get them to
[SPEAKER_01]: basically be tilled back under,
but without actually tilling and really
[SPEAKER_01]: disturbing the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a rather long explanation of the
differences, but they're varied and vast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually was a short version.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's really, really good to have that
amount of detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the same piece of equipment you're
using for low till?
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually purchased a Kubota tractor
last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main reason I wanted the tractor was
so I could do large scale indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganism piles, which is a Korean
natural farming methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we went through, it turned out that
we're like, oh, wow, go figure,
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers really need tractors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very, very useful for a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used it for putting rock out on the
road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through that system, I was like,
yes, I can rent that BCS rototiller from
[SPEAKER_01]: my local shop that rents out equipment,
but that thing costs, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 bucks a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually need it for at least a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to need it a couple of times a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't do things like move rock around
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the Kubota tractor, what we can do is
we don't actually have it yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're working on getting a couple of
attachments on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them will be a rototiller
attachment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a lot of different equipment for
tractors, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had my choice, I would probably get
something that is, and I can't remember
[SPEAKER_01]: the name of it right now, but there are
ones that actually will fold the soil over
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than tilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there are different companies,
not Kubota specifically, that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: called bio-somethings.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Sunshine knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why we would like that
equipment at some point is because we are
[SPEAKER_01]: planning on doing a dry farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry farms are farms that have no
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, okay, wait, how do you
grow things without water?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually just a completely different
methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're doing is you're keeping ...
There's no cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no companion plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you cover crop in the winter,
but there's no companion plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing growing except for your
cash crops in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is you end up with a dust
mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a layer on the top that's hot and
dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that gets hot, the way water wicks,
the way it transpires, the way it moves in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, if you have the right soil texture,
that's key, which we happen to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That top layer will dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will get hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cool water from below will be wicked
upwards towards the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you end up with is a little layer of
hot, dry soil and then a layer of really
[SPEAKER_01]: moist, beautiful, rich soil underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: This tuner, tiller, it's ta-ta.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts with a T.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever this thing is called.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bioturner maybe, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it does is it protects your biology
and it just literally flips your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: around so it loosens it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It aerates it a little bit, but it doesn't
actually till it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do want one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then for the farm land that is irrigated,
that thing doesn't work as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: to my understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we'll do is have the road to tiller
attachment on the back of the tractor that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just going to set your depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of setting it all the way down
where it's tilling 18 inches or so,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just set it so it's just basically
just touching the top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that will do is that will incorporate
all those amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll get rid of all those weed seeds that
have germinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also will allow us to have soil contact
with our Korean natural farming inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indigenous microorganisms need to actually
contact the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just spraying it on top of
grasses and things, it still works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a more limited efficacy than if
you can actually have contact with the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, of course, we will be mulching on
top of that and then the plants go into
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil through the mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine for the folks that are tuning in
that are more of a small scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I have a lot of home growers that
grow indoors or they have small outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were to implement low till,
they could probably just use a small hand
[SPEAKER_00]: rake, for example, and dig down an inch or
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine a lot of people doing that when
they're top dressing in organic
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is their top dressing but using a small
little rake or something or using their
[SPEAKER_00]: hands to mix things up on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of similar to doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's basically like scratching it
into the top of the soil there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works out really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times with home growers and with
people that have indoor gardens,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a little different because you're not
working with living soil so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many people that are like,
but I do, I have worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, and worms are amazing and
they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily an indicator that you
have a functional soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: True living soil is a system that is
self-sustaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that you're not adding
microbial activity, microbiology every
[SPEAKER_01]: single week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime I see a bottle of microbes that
says you need to add this with every
[SPEAKER_01]: watering, my brain goes, okay,
but why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because biology works in the same way that
all life works, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that it replicates, be it through
asexual or sexual replication,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not doing that, there's something
wrong with this environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's something wrong with this
environment, you're having to keep adding
[SPEAKER_01]: new populations all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This to me just doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out there in nature, nobody's going out
there and adding bacillus species to the
[SPEAKER_01]: forest every single week.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to get a biologically
active soil, your big takeaway here is
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to do it with potting
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to do it with a soil-less
medium and most potting soil is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: junky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most compost that you buy commercially is
pretty junky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Municipal compost is full of pesticides
and herbicides because there's no check
[SPEAKER_01]: and balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who wants to put green waste into
a municipal composting facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just send their green waste off and
you have no recourse on or no knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: even of what was put on those plants
before they went into that facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most composting facilities don't use
biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just use heat and pressure and
turning and oxygenation, which is great
[SPEAKER_01]: for breaking down material, but
truthfully, it doesn't mitigate anything
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's poisons or herbicides or even
excess fertilizer, it's not really getting
[SPEAKER_01]: broken down in that composting process.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start adding biology,
it's a whole different world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are amazing studies that I read all
the time about how different fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: species and different bacterial species
have the ability to actually mitigate
[SPEAKER_01]: things like oil spills.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard about that for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ones now that are showing that
they're mitigating heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toxic heavy metals like cadmium and
arsenic are a lot of problem in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: native soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you have an extremely diverse
microbiological population that has lots
[SPEAKER_01]: of fungi, lots of bacteria, lots of amoeba
and nematodes and everything you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: show that you have a functional soil food
web, you're going to probably or possibly,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, the jury's still out on that
one, what the probability is, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a good likelihood that you have something
that can actually start mitigating those
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals and they'll tie it up in
their body or they'll chelate it and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually make it into a compound that's
not bioavailable to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just cool, cool, cool, amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that has more to do with people
that are growing outside in native soil
[SPEAKER_01]: than people that are inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even for people that are inside,
they're like, well, I don't want to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: the outside inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this nice sterile environment that
I think I'm able to keep in its little
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's not really the way plants
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a limited cycle with your potting
soil inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to grow inside back in the day in
Humboldt County a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point, the norm became to take out
your dirt every time you planted a new
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd remove all your soil and you'd bring
in all new bags of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point, I was just like,
okay, this is silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This feels really silly to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My garden loved it because it got fresh
potting soil all the time, made my heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: clay much more aerated and light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm tired of doing all this
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to reuse our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just add compost and some amendments
like we would outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked really well for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what I found was that we actually
moved into beds and we did bring in a
[SPEAKER_01]: little tiny rototiller, like a little
mantis thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd turn everything around and you'd
till it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we found is that pretty soon,
your soil texture turns into dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns into garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose all the good texture that's in
that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets really compacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants start getting really unhappy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potting soil is not like regular outside
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at it, it's pretty obvious,
but experientially, especially as a young
[SPEAKER_01]: person that was growing up doing a lot of
gardening and a lot of farming of
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants that aren't widely talked
about or that weren't widely talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: at the time, it was like you didn't really
know what you were doing wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were just experiencing things and
realizing that after doing this four or
[SPEAKER_01]: five times, it's not working anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would that be?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's different from outside?
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking back and forth and being like,
ah, different organic matter, different
[SPEAKER_01]: starting material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we started incorporating native soil
back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd actually go and dig buckets up out of
the garden and bring those inside and
[SPEAKER_01]: realized very quickly that you could
actually rehabilitate that potting soil if
[SPEAKER_01]: you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd bring in wood chips and duff from the
forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started mulching.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't mulching at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't mulch inside because,
I don't know, why would you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really know what I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil science wasn't such a thing when I
was in my early 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe it was and I just didn't know
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I wasn't such a soil nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started mulching, so we were protecting
that layer of our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then as we would gently turn it in on the
next round, it added organic material to
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil itself, which added to the soil
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking back on it now, I'm like,
man, I wish I had somebody like me to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: me how to do it back then rather than
doing all of this trial and error over
[SPEAKER_01]: years and years of being like,
why is this so different?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we having so many pest issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have problems like this outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I have this inside?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's more protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, there's got to be more to it
than this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have certainly come a long way and
things are a lot easier now with the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge we have today versus five years
ago, 10 years ago, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible the amount of knowledge
that is circling around there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community and people implementing in their
gardens today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to low till.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've low tilled your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing anything else to prepare for
planting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some people add in amendments or
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people plant a cover crop and then
grow their plants with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing anything else preparing the
soil for planting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we basically want to have something
growing in our soil at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, it's not our native grasses
because they seed readily and frequently
[SPEAKER_01]: and they have deep roots and they're just
really difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: They outgrow everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're difficult to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the wintertime, we missed our little
window.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had some rain up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was trying to get out to actually do
our cover crop in the areas that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: already harvested, but we didn't quite get
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done living mulch at different times
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really like to have mulch on our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the easiest way for people to kind
of keep soil covered and not have to worry
[SPEAKER_01]: about cultivating or taking care of
something or weeding all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just do a super heavy thick layer
of mulch alfalfa, organic alfalfa is
[SPEAKER_01]: really the jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll actually see the residual benefits
the next year of that organic alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, organic alfalfa is
apparently next to impossible to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are trying to mulch 18,000
square feet with organic alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need these very, very large bales.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weigh about 500 pounds and we usually
use about six.
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually use about 10 to 12 of them per
year and we couldn't get any this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was none to be had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was calling from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was calling Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was calling Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was calling Oregon, Washington up into
Idaho, and I couldn't find anybody that
[SPEAKER_01]: had organic alfalfa available for
purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all have been contracted out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something's going on with like the
dairy industry, I guess, or animal
[SPEAKER_01]: husbandry that people are really moving
towards needing that organic alfalfa for
[SPEAKER_01]: animal feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not available for farmers like me
to use for mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this year we tried living mulch,
which is basically a short growing plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that grows underneath your cash crop and
it keeps your soil from being bare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had limited success with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the problem was by the time I gave
up on finding alfalfa, we were well into
[SPEAKER_01]: summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the seed that we put out didn't
germinate very well because it was too hot
[SPEAKER_01]: and dry already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and we've had years where
it's very successful and we've had years
[SPEAKER_01]: like this where it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So luckily, in a way, we don't have to
worry about a living mulch that we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: contend with trying to save.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had years where I literally would dig
it up and move it out of the way because
[SPEAKER_01]: once you add cover crop that generally
grows tall and high and you have to cut it
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing cover crop and you're
chopping it down, your living mulch is now
[SPEAKER_01]: being smothered out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to have living mulch
and cover crop, you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: remove your living mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my living mulches generally don't
overwinter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They die back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm back at that problem of having bare
soil again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will, as soon as we can,
plant a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: My preferred cover crop is a mixture of
legumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So different peas and like fava beans and
things like that and some vetch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of like winter rye that
people add and grasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, I'm not a huge fan of the grasses
as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to break up any compaction
layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of those grasses have really,
really deep roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really good for heavy fixed soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our soil has been cultivated now for,
I think, the most recent garden is running
[SPEAKER_01]: on eight years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh gosh, maybe more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere around in that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the oldest garden is about 15
years of that same soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being taken care of and being built every
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got beautiful texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice and loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do amend every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not send out for soil tests this
year, but I do recommend you do test your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil just so you kind of have an idea of
baseline of what's there, what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: macronutrients are available or present,
what kind of micronutrients are present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can help you just kind of decide
what you want to amend with if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: amend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a I'm going to go against the grain
of what people are frequently told.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pay any attention to people like
Dr. Elaine Ingham and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful regenerative scientists and
people that advocate for regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture, they're all phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love them to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're amazing and super smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But experientially, I have not had the
experience that they say, which is that
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that you need in the soil is
present in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has not been what I've noticed at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are generally very nitrogen deficient
if we don't add nitrogen to our soil or
[SPEAKER_01]: else I'm having to constantly feed my
plants all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd rather put it in at the beginning
and have it be there in the soil so that
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants have access to it when they
need it rather than me dictating when I
[SPEAKER_01]: think the plant needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually by the time I notice a deficiency,
even if it's super early on, the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: like, yeah, I've been starving for like
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for finally feeding me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I make sure they're in the soil,
then I don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take that kind of off my plate and
not have it be a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the main things that gets
kind of missed is certain crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially our medicinal herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're removing the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not just removing the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a tomato and you're just
taking the tomato fruit off, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: removing that nutrient, all the nutrients
and minerals that it took to make that
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit have disappeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you leave the plant, all of the
leaves will decay, your vines will decay,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll add to your soil and anything that
that plant utilized from the soil will be
[SPEAKER_01]: returned to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a medicinal plant and
you're taking the whole thing out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're removing all the nutrients that
that plant accumulated over the courses of
[SPEAKER_01]: its life from the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you're gonna have to replace
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, again, nitrogen is the big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We prefer organic manures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We prefer organic alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can find alfalfa meal when I can find
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some crustacean meals and things are
really, really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we usually do rock dust every
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, I'd like to get enough rock dust
to do it once every 20 years, but that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be like a lot of rock dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rock dust has all of your trace minerals
and micronutrients, not all of,
[SPEAKER_01]: but most of your trace minerals and
micronutrients that your plants need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually do some oyster shell that adds
to our calcium, which tends to get
[SPEAKER_01]: depleted rather rapidly with the crops
that we farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're working with fallow soil or
native soil that hasn't ever been utilized
[SPEAKER_01]: before, as many earthworm castings as you
can afford is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It adds biology instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you're getting rolling, you don't
need to add as much or you don't need to
[SPEAKER_01]: add as much every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can kind of go one year on,
one year off type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we put in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's kind of the majority of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really our big ticket item.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our do this one thing to get the most
out of it is gonna be indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've mentioned that a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We shorten it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I laugh a lot because in KNF it's like,
oh, we have more acronyms than the Navy
[SPEAKER_01]: SEALs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is acronymized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's a word it is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So IMO, indigenous microorganism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that is is you're going out into
nature, you're finding areas that are
[SPEAKER_01]: undisturbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking, it's not your backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not your garden that you've already
been cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not your compost pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: People really like, look at my IMO from my
compost pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that's compost microorganism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not indigenous microorganism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why we wanna go out into
undisturbed areas is because it has the
[SPEAKER_01]: most biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're trying to do is capture as
much diversity as we can in these
[SPEAKER_01]: collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to do it as often as we can
from as many different subtle locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our farm, I have an oak tree that I
love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right on the edge of a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get great collections from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also wanna have a collection
underneath the bay tree, which has a
[SPEAKER_01]: different microbiological community living
under it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also wanna do under a tan oak,
which is again, another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have fir trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have maple trees where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have live oak.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of trees in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that that diversity under
the soil mimics the diversity above the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a lot of diversity in my
indigenous microorganism collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what I'm doing is I'm taking all of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm inoculating out and culturing a large
scale pile that is comprised of carbon and
[SPEAKER_01]: carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're doing is we're really
trying to peg food for fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want all of the mushroomy type
things, all the mycelium that's running
[SPEAKER_01]: through the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna say, you should come to my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should come live with my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plants and you guys would get along
really well, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not there in native soil quite
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in our deciduous trees and it's in
our old growth forests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I'm not going to dig up all the
dirt in the old growth forest to move to
[SPEAKER_01]: my farm because then I would be killing my
old growth forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't wanna do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we culture it on a bed of rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take that rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then have like 10 to 12 of those rice
cultures that all have different biology
[SPEAKER_01]: in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We inoculate it out into this carbon and
carbohydrate substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does is that's the perfect
food for fungi specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll also have bacteria, terrestrial
yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that being said, obviously,
to increase the soil health that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: on the farm, indigenous microorganisms or
IMO is our very best friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every year, well, or every other year,
give or take, what we try to do is make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that we are adding more of those
indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an ongoing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't ever stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always doing IMO1, which is that
initial collection from the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every year I'm trying to make that
into IMO3, which is many, many IMO2
[SPEAKER_01]: collections, which is the stabilized form
of IMO1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm taking that IMO3,
marrying it with my garden soil and then
[SPEAKER_01]: broadcasting that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually don't go all the way to IMO5
just so they don't generally have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the compost or the manure that we use
will just go kind of on top or again,
[SPEAKER_01]: be low tilled in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the one thing that KNF really works
well with no till situations is because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not tearing apart those fungal
hyphae, you're not exposing that
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiology, and therefore you're not
having to add it as often.
[SPEAKER_01]: With what we're doing with the low till
situation, we know that that first few
[SPEAKER_01]: inches of soil is going to end up being
not so happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have biology that's dying
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we want to add it back with
the IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the great thing about IMO is that you
really don't need a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do need a decent amount, but it's not
hundreds of thousands of pounds or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that the standard application
rate is 3,000 pounds per acre,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I recall correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always have to go to my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, where I'm at now is that
we just want to every year try and make a
[SPEAKER_01]: 2,000 to 5,000 pound pile and then just
broadcast that out over whatever square
[SPEAKER_01]: footage we're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really can't overdo it either,
which is a nice thing about IMO3 and IMO4
[SPEAKER_01]: is that it's not like chicken manure where
it's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you put it in there, you might
overdo it and kill all your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could literally grow in just IMO4 if
you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know that I would necessarily
recommend it because you don't have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, a part of Korean natural
farming is utilizing as little as you can
[SPEAKER_01]: for the most efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the biggest bang for your buck for the
least amount of work because as a gardener
[SPEAKER_01]: or a farmer, you have a ton of other
things that you have to do in any given
[SPEAKER_01]: hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can do something that has a
percent success rate of 80%, I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on that one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that for us is indigenous
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another benefit that we haven't even
touched on yet is pest resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have plants that will come into us
from nurseries and things and from other
[SPEAKER_01]: sources that will have like aphids or
mites of some kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, or thrips is
another great one that plants love to
[SPEAKER_01]: hitchhike in on you and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found is once we plant them in
the garden, the population will boom for a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute and then it just dies back
naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have access to open air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like again, we're outside, not inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're inside, I don't know that
this works quite as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people that are espousing
that if you have a healthy enough plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is pest resistant naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I agree with that to a certain
extent, it's kind of impossible to know
[SPEAKER_01]: how healthy your healthy plant has to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: What looks healthy to us might not be
truly 100% optimal health.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also know that like with human beings,
the only people that are at optimal health
[SPEAKER_01]: are people that are, A have the amazing
genetics that they have and B are
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely high level athletes that are
watching their diet and they're exercising
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're being very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us are not at that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think most plants are at that
level either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it doesn't really matter how
healthy your plant looks to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is probably some amount of weakness
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so therefore once pests take hold,
especially if you're inside, it's near
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're outside, again, it's a little
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have this beautiful environment
that's all protected and there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: natural predators that can come in and the
pests just love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put thrips in an inside garden and
they just, you know, go Richter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put spider mites in an inside garden
or aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's no predators in there and
there's no wind to knock them down and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no rain to wash them off,
they get to be pretty difficult even in a
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really healthy soil system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we have IPM integrated pest
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's integrated pest management,
not integrated pest eradication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're inside, even if you're
practicing living soil technique and
[SPEAKER_01]: Korean natural farming, you know,
you're going to find less bugs probably,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not necessarily going to
eradicate them 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may need to stay on top of some
type of preventative maintenance,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if it's just biocontrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have healthy living soil,
it's well mulched and covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got microbiology that's extremely
diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a really, really healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably okay with just monthly
releases of biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those would be predators for your
pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you notice you have a couple of
spider mites, you're going to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: predatory mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you notice you have a couple aphids,
you're going to get some green lacewing
[SPEAKER_01]: larvae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are things that you can use
inside that can mitigate problems before
[SPEAKER_01]: they become super problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside, again, I don't really do any of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just plant them in the dirt and we
allow them to grow for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually it's somewhere in the two to three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll watch the population just get
decimated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that, I think, is that the
plants become stronger and healthier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have access to more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their cellular walls get thicker,
which makes it harder for sap sucking
[SPEAKER_01]: insects to pierce them and get into that
sap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have access to the wind
and the rain and the natural predators
[SPEAKER_01]: that are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, Korean natural farming has that
microbiology diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That diversity of soil biology allows
those plants to uptake nutrients that are
[SPEAKER_01]: harder to get normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That allows it for it to be a stronger,
healthier plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, what they'll do is
they'll resort to sprays as a
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing any type of sprays in order
to prevent pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you like avoiding spraying your
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: We avoid spraying unless we're foliar
feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to foliar feed our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that we do when they are
not producing fruits or flowers yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they start producing fruits and
flowers, we tend to avoid away from that,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially our medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those ones we really don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they're in their production stage,
we don't want to be spraying anything on
[SPEAKER_01]: them at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, there is something called
JWA, or JADAM, wedding agent, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: homemade soap, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that it mitigates just about
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a mite, HRM mites, that are out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those who know, know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know, you know it's really,
really difficult to combat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found wonderful success with just
spraying just JWA, JADAM, wedding agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to do it every third day for
three weeks, is my protocol for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does have pretty much almost full
eradication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have predator insects that
you bring in to kind of do the mop up with
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody that you might have missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as IPM sprays, if you can avoid
it and if you can get plants that are
[SPEAKER_01]: super healthy and happy and not have to do
that and just use biocontrol, it is a much
[SPEAKER_01]: better process to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are not paying attention and
you have a population explosion of pests,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have to use knockback
spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they get past the point where you're
like, oh shoot, I have bugs, it's too
[SPEAKER_01]: late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Predator insects are not going to do the
job for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know people that say that they
have done like massive releases of like
[SPEAKER_01]: Californicus or Swirski, which are
different mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Predatory mites and been able to mitigate
pest problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I myself have tried that and not had that
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of other growers that have
not had that success and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've also got a problem if you did
not identify your pest correctly and you
[SPEAKER_01]: did not release the right predator for it,
you've now wasted a lot of money on
[SPEAKER_01]: predators that are not specific to that
pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knockback spray of a simple soap is a
really, really good way to go if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, ideally, your IPM, your
integrated pest management is that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: managing your pests before they even get
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have predators prevalent and ready
to fight if they show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a healthy enough plant that
if they show up, they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: eh, this is maybe too hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might hitchhike back out to something
that's easier victims out there in the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can avoid those sprays,
it can certainly save a ton of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know people who are spraying
their plants every single week,
[SPEAKER_00]: religiously, just to prevent, you know,
they aren't even battling infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you can get to a point where
you don't have to spray on a weekly basis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can save a ton of time doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing that we didn't get into
really that kind of relates to all this is
[SPEAKER_00]: companion planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love my companion plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So companion planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two terminologies and they're
kind of used loosely and interchangeably,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in my mind, they shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a cover crop, which is really
meant to cover your soil when you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a crop in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that was the first definition of
these was cover crops were put in in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fall and it covered the soil so that in
and a lot of it were winter dieback.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you live in a place where it's
really cold, you can put a winter rye in
[SPEAKER_01]: and it will grow, it will get nice and
big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as the freeze comes, it will die
back, but it'll turn into its own layer of
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really easy way to just,
you know, have both mulching and covering
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people like us in California,
that doesn't work so well because we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have killing frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things don't die back very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's your cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your companion plant is just what
it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a plant that is company for your cash
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So companion plants are amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a big bee in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Companion plants are amazing for a lot of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I really love about
companion plants is that different plants
[SPEAKER_01]: have different microbial interactions in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a more increased plant
diversity above the soil, you have a more
[SPEAKER_01]: increased microbiological diversity under
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that if your plant has
different communities it likes to hang out
[SPEAKER_01]: with, there's a greater chance of those
communities being there and staying alive
[SPEAKER_01]: with other plants being there and alive as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So companion plants we've used in the
past, we've used food crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used watermelon and cucumber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not recommend you use a vine as a
companion plant because it can strangle
[SPEAKER_01]: your cash crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I tend to break all the
rules on my own because I can,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, or because I want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those have been very, very bad
choices, like letting my kids plant bird
[SPEAKER_01]: seed, wild bird seed turned into millet,
which has turned into a five year issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always miss some at set seeds really
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also led to me discovering though that it
makes a really great mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can get your millet out there,
you can buy bird seed, literally for bird
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very cheap, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can spread it and you'll generally
have millet, possibly some amaranth and
[SPEAKER_01]: some sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of those are wonderful plants to
have in your garden if you can make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that your millet doesn't take over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Millet has really, really deep roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard to get it out of the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes back from the crown really
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It moves through the rhizosphere very
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll actually send out like roots that
will pop up new millet plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got a small gardening space,
I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a large gardening space,
you might dedicate part of it to just be
[SPEAKER_01]: millet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go and cut it down and have your
own mulch really easily that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, not your best companion plant
either, which was what I arrived at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I originally let my kids do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, this is your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's kind of started taking over
other areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So millet, not your best choice for a
companion plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a good choice for a cover crop
dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is good then?
[SPEAKER_01]: So something that grows low, purslane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fabulous, fabulous cover crop companion
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will cover your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will last through the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will recede.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will come back and it grows for the
most part fairly low to the soil up to
[SPEAKER_01]: about six to eight inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a cash crop or a herbal
medicinal plant that grows very tall,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can easily utilize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a really easy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take any management whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It generally likes, you know, it can
handle drought tolerant, not super drought
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerant, but it does OK in low water
situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do a low till situation,
you can literally till it under and it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: come back from its seeds the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a fun one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else have we done?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried beets, which didn't turn out
very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't enough sunlight underneath,
so that didn't companion plant well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marigolds people talk about a lot because
they think that it has a natural pyrethrin
[SPEAKER_01]: in it, which is a pest deterrent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the marigolds that people
plant are not the ones that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: contain that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might not be the pyrethrin,
actually, now that I think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be something else I don't quite
recall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's only French marigolds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very specific strain or cultivar of
marigold that has that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't noticed it to necessarily
work that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I do love marigolds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're absolutely gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use them as a companion plant every
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love petunias.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they do for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, they maybe increase the
diversity in the soil because it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: petunia, but nothing really grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Petunias will take over their area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're literally so prolific with their
foliate and their flowers that they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: take everything that they can and nothing
else can grow underneath them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're easy to care for.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how good of a pollinator they
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't usually see my pollinators on my
petunias.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually see them on the dandelions that
are right next to the petunias.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as a pollinator companion goes,
not sure that one's your best bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've used lamb's quarter with varying
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lamb's quarter is a great bioaccumulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it will do is it'll actually take
nutrients out of the deep soil and put
[SPEAKER_01]: them up into its leaves and store it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can cut it down and compost
it or chop and drop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those nutrients will return to the
soil and be more available to your cash
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they also grow really tall and
they're kind of a pain in the butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know that I have mixed feelings
about lamb's quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally forget how much of a pain in
the butt it is and then will allow it to
[SPEAKER_01]: come back one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next few years be like,
oh yeah, that was kind of difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think personally it's kind of
our big one right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a cold area, Dichondra ripens
is a wonderful cover crop or companion
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, I mean, that doesn't die back in
the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's another one that kind of bridges
that gap of companion plant cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can use thyme as companions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing an herbal medicinal
plant that you want to be more prolific in
[SPEAKER_01]: the way that it smells, you can do things
like basil, thyme, oregano, rosemary,
[SPEAKER_01]: and these things all have the potential to
make your herbal plants more herbaceous
[SPEAKER_01]: and have higher smelling points,
higher aromatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that there's been a lot of
firm research that shows that
[SPEAKER_01]: definitively, but anecdotally people
definitely say that that is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, personally like food crops or
crops that have a secondary use are my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite companion plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our purslane we utilize to make
fermented plant juice, which is one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: Korean natural farming fertilizer inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes care of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't require anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes back every year and I can use it
for fertilizer as well as protecting the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and adding to that diversity that we
talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can find things that are like
triple threats like that, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: singing, dancing, and acting, you've got
fertilizer, microbiological diversity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and keeping your soil covered and safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's a great companion plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a lot of good information
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself have been growing indoors for 12
years and I've only grown outdoors since
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what four or five years and I
haven't yet used companion plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely some of the information is
takeaways for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: On that one note, be careful of what you
do use as a companion plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pay attention to what kind of pests
are prevalent on that companion plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made the mistake of utilizing white
Dutch clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear all, when you start going down
this like companion plant cover crop type
[SPEAKER_01]: of rabbit hole, one of the first things
you hear about is white Dutch clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I use right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my white Dutch clover became a
phenomenal banker for thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had thrips that went up and down between
my white Dutch clover and my plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: were there, my cash crop plants,
up and down and up and down, and I could
[SPEAKER_01]: not get rid of them at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because there was that white Dutch
clover that was such a preferred food
[SPEAKER_01]: source, and then they would go up and
nibble on my cash crop and then they'd go
[SPEAKER_01]: back down and hide in the companion plant,
I couldn't mitigate them at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't even manage them because I
couldn't spray my cover crop or my
[SPEAKER_01]: companion plant, my clover that was down
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up having to continually chop
that clover down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clover is great for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes wonderful biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it becomes a banker for something
like thrips, it becomes an extreme problem
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can't get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it also will send out runners that
become new plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's self seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it comes back every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've now got it to where it stays in my
walkways and gets trumpled on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if there's a pest problem,
it's not spreading to my other plants
[SPEAKER_01]: nearly as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the preferred food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they tend to stay in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't go to my other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But especially if you're in an indoor
situation, your clover can become a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem with thrips specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nasturtiums and violas or violets
or pansies that all become problems for
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your spider mites will go in and out of
those companion plants and in and out of
[SPEAKER_01]: your foliage back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just having a sweet old time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it wouldn't it's not as
much of a problem if you have those other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants there because they'll be the
primary food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you will have some plant resist or
plant weakening in your cash crops because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're constantly being kind of nibbled
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Russet mites specifically are very,
very host specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are tomato russet mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They eat tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is, you know, hemp russet mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It eats hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a well, that's a gall mite,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most mites, most of most russet mites
are plant specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't tend to go back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, as far as I know,
and I could be wrong there because I know
[SPEAKER_01]: they have been studying a lot these russet
mites in institutions and things now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as I last knew, they were
trying to get russet mites to move between
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and and hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were not having good success with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they couldn't they couldn't get them to
go back and forth the way that they wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hops being one of the closest plants to
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were, you know, unable to do that
in a educational setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out in nature, it might be a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as it goes with the studies
that are being done, they've not had good
[SPEAKER_01]: success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just kind of have a mindset of like,
OK, if I wanted to use columbine,
[SPEAKER_01]: what likes the columbine leaf miners and
thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe columbine is not going to be even
though it's a beautiful flower and I love
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not want to put that in as a
companion with my cash crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might want to look at things that are
less that have less pests in similarity,
[SPEAKER_01]: in similarity, in similarity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a word?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less pests, similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely some good tips there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am probably going to stop using white
Dutch clover now that you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little bit of a bag left,
so I won't waste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but yeah, that's that's crazy that
thrips feed off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are getting up towards the end of
the episode here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a wealth of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered so much, so much everything
from how you do low till low till versus
[SPEAKER_00]: no till cover crops, companion plants,
mulch layers, some of the KNF inputs that
[SPEAKER_00]: you do, pest prevention, a long list of
things we covered in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us, how can the listeners find you
and what do you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can find us online at www.sunnabis
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's S-U-N-N-A-B-I-S dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also very active on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunnabis is our Instagram handle as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a repost thing that posts to,
I think, Twitter and my Facebook page,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think is now Sunnabis,
but it might be Humboldt's Full Sun Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not as active with engagement on those
platforms, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I am missing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can email me at Wendy at Sunnabis dot
com if you have a burning question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, a direct message through
Instagram might be a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: better and quicker bet on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also find us on organiccultivators
.net.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a list of resources there that
kind of goes a little bit deeper into some
[SPEAKER_01]: of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on getting some blogs up on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to come and hang out in
person, you can find me at the Cowboy Cup
[SPEAKER_01]: in December in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to hang out for three days
and get a ton of education, you can come
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Organic Cultivators Supernatural
Conference, which will be in Sturbridge,
[SPEAKER_01]: Massachusetts, in February.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.

[SPEAKER_00]: Wendy, once again, thanks so much for
coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely appreciate your time and hope
you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love spreading this message.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love sharing the information and kind of
all the trials and tribulations we've gone
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I hope this helps people kind
of get through that learning curve a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit quicker than I may have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really encourage people to go out
there and plant something, grow something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a windowsill, you can get a
small pot of dirt and you can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: something, and it's really going to be
something that changes your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
