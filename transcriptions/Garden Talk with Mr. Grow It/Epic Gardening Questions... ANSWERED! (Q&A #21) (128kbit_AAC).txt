[SPEAKER_00]: At what week of flower do you pollinate
your females for best seed results?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned from Subcool around day 28 is
what he had mentioned and I've just been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that really anywhere between day 20
to 35 is a rough range where people like
[SPEAKER_00]: to another thing that people say is uh
pollinate the plant when it looks horny
[SPEAKER_00]: when you see those uh those pistols
stigmas and they're really bursting out
[SPEAKER_00]: from all directions that's when you hit it
with the pollination so but usually it's
[SPEAKER_00]: around day 28 is when i'm going in there
and pollinating the female plants and then
[SPEAKER_00]: of course i'm just letting that plant grow
and grow and grow all the way up as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: i can because uh really i'm not harvesting
for flowers so oftentimes i'm going past
[SPEAKER_00]: the harvest window so i can get more seed
development out of it there have been some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants where it just looks cannibalized
towards the end there because i'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing it to try to get more seeds out of
it and seeds will be dropping for sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: know when you push a plant that long
that's been pollinated seeds start
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping off of it evo diode i really like
the evo diode i mean it's samsung's newest
[SPEAKER_00]: release right for diode so the lm301h evo
diode 3.14 micromoles per joule so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome i know there's some companies that
have included them in their fixtures i did
[SPEAKER_00]: want to mention that mars hydro actually
is including them now in their fc series
[SPEAKER_00]: big shout out to mars hydro they're
actually sponsoring this q and a video so
[SPEAKER_00]: the fc 3000 evo they've got the fc 8000 fc
1000 w fc 6500 and fc 4800 all have the
[SPEAKER_00]: evo diodes from samsung in there and
they're actually doing a sale right now
[SPEAKER_00]: 14% off all of the items on their website
so i'm actually use coupon code mr grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: if you use my coupon code mr grow it helps
me gives me some uh some credit there and
[SPEAKER_00]: this sale is running from the 14th to the
27th so i want to jump on it now and uh
[SPEAKER_00]: save some mula i'll have a link in the
description section below what do you do
[SPEAKER_00]: when you get clarring and toxicity in
organic living soil grow i think that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good question what i normally do is
just continue to water in i don't do any
[SPEAKER_00]: type of flushing i haven't been in a
situation where i needed to would i felt
[SPEAKER_00]: like i needed to flush in organic soil
right soil with just organic amendments in
[SPEAKER_00]: there i've just been kind of doing
watering and then letting the plant kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of work itself out of it you know if i
need to keep a plant in the vegetation
[SPEAKER_00]: stage a little bit longer then that's what
i do before flipping the flower but yeah i
[SPEAKER_00]: have come across that where you get some a
little bit darker of leaves shiny clarring
[SPEAKER_00]: clear sign of nitrogen toxicity and uh
yeah i just continue to kind of just feed
[SPEAKER_00]: plain water only and then eventually that
plant kind of bounces out of it right it
[SPEAKER_00]: depletes the the nutrients within the
medium the amendments have you know broken
[SPEAKER_00]: down plants have uptaken those nutrients
and uh you start to see it kind of bounce
[SPEAKER_00]: back and be fine from there so that's what
i've done i know there are other growers
[SPEAKER_00]: out there who just they flush they go
right to flushing they go ahead and run a
[SPEAKER_00]: ton of water through the medium in order
to flush out and kind of start back from
[SPEAKER_00]: scratch but i personally haven't done that
what are your thoughts on 1212 from seed
[SPEAKER_00]: never heard much about it i've done it so
i've done it a couple different times i've
[SPEAKER_00]: done it in a solo cup and one thing to
know about 1212 that i think a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people have misconceptions on is if you
are planting a seed seed sprouts on the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium right day one it's getting 1212
light cycle it's still going to spend some
[SPEAKER_00]: time in the vegetation stage it's not
going to go right to shooting all pistols
[SPEAKER_00]: and start flowering and have barely any
growth right it's going to spend the first
[SPEAKER_00]: 20-ish days in the veg stage before you
start seeing pistol i believe it was 21
[SPEAKER_00]: days is when i first started seeing
pistols on a plant that i just gave 1212
[SPEAKER_00]: right off the bat so you get some veg
period then of course it starts to flower
[SPEAKER_00]: so yeah you can totally do that some
people do that in order to save on energy
[SPEAKER_00]: you can some people do that on the sog
technique see if green so if they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that one cola coming up but a bunch
of different plants they'll just hit it
[SPEAKER_00]: with the 1212 right off the bat it'll grow
up you know eight ten twelve inches
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll just keep that one cola and then
it will start flowering and then they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have a whole bunch of just single colas
sog technique so there's a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: different reasons for why you would
potentially do it i've just been sticking
[SPEAKER_00]: with the 18.6 for the veg and then 1212
for flower because i do like to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: control over the veg period let me veg the
plants for as long as i want to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant shaped the way i want to then kind
of flip it to flower but uh yeah 1212 that
[SPEAKER_00]: is definitely a thing that people do for a
couple different reasons can you please
[SPEAKER_00]: explain what power should be run at seed
veg and flower and the height this is all
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent on what grow light you're using
so grow lights are all not created equal
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some folks that have a grow
light where they're dimming it down and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting super close to their
plants other folks are putting on a full
[SPEAKER_00]: blast having the light all the way up at
the top of the tent and then just keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: on that setting the entire time and then
the plant kind of grow into it a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways you can go about it some
people are going to say that hey if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping a full blast all the time
especially with just seedlings you're
[SPEAKER_00]: wasting energy so some people prefer to
kind of bring it down and then dim it down
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's really impossible to give you a
blanket answer on what power should be run
[SPEAKER_00]: at seed veg and flower cycle a different
way to go about it would be dl i a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people go after in between 40 and 60 dl i
so if you're tracking dl i that is said to
[SPEAKER_00]: be kind of one of the more accurate ways
in determining how much light your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: should get on a daily basis the other
thing would be par let people look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: ppfd numbers they have a par meter and
they'll look if you do have a par meter
[SPEAKER_00]: although they are very expensive it can be
useful i have one i'm looking at giving
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 to 400 ppfd and seedling for clones
even mother plants i'm just going to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: them growing slow 400 to 600 ppfd for
plants in the vegetation stage and then
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 900 ppfd in the flowering stage if
supplementing co2 a lot of people going a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit higher than that so um so yeah
that's kind of the best answer i can give
[SPEAKER_00]: you for for that question it's really
dependent on what grow light you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: on what power you can put it at what
height you can put it at for the different
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of growth this is my first harvest
i've dried some a larf and then some of it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out smelling really good and some of
it smells like a plant we're in 65 temp 60
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity so my actual question is when you
hang dry how long does it take the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to smell to go away it's it'll take a
little bit right you have that fresh plant
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest smell that you get certainly you
can have that in the drying phase for sure
[SPEAKER_00]: once you get into curing so once you
you've dried for in between four and ten
[SPEAKER_00]: days some people are longer than that
actually uh and planning a video talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about drying and curing with a bunch of
studies that have been come out pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: recently here but ideal drying time
according to latest studies is anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between four and i think it's 12 days of
drying if you go longer if you do an
[SPEAKER_00]: extended dry micro growth is a concern but
uh 65 60 should be fine and you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: once you get into curing and you start
burping those jars and having that
[SPEAKER_00]: offgassing happen within the matter of
weeks you'll see the true smell start to
[SPEAKER_00]: come out from there i have taken cuts for
the first time 14 days ago on wednesday i
[SPEAKER_00]: have some that have rooted but others that
have not in your opinion how long should i
[SPEAKER_00]: let the ones that have not rooted ride in
the dome and what should i do about the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that don't take thanks good question
i am assuming that you're going straight
[SPEAKER_00]: into the medium so maybe you're cutting a
clone and putting directly into soil or
[SPEAKER_00]: directly into cocoa i'm gonna assume
that's kind of what you're using since you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't mention any other type of method
i've been through that same exact thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: where i've got cloned put them in the soil
and then they didn't take root one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that for me i've found is the
actual temperature of the soil so i made
[SPEAKER_00]: the mistake a long time ago of having kind
of winter time number one so a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: struggle a little bit harder to keep the
root zone temperature up but utilizing a
[SPEAKER_00]: heat mat so i'm not sure if you use
utilizing a heat mat or not but that might
[SPEAKER_00]: be what is causing it not to root either
that or lack of oxygen in the root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the roots don't maybe the soil is
too moist it's just not getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen that needs maybe drainage on the
containers i don't know if using like solo
[SPEAKER_00]: cups for example i used to just slice the
solo cups i wish i had a picture here to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of show you but just kind of slices
versus taking out a big amount of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the solo cups drastic difference
you know now that there's better drainage
[SPEAKER_00]: better air getting down in there so those
are things that i would check out if i
[SPEAKER_00]: were you because those are kind of the
main reasons i've come across for things
[SPEAKER_00]: not rooting when cloning and just putting
it directly into soil or cocoa have you
[SPEAKER_00]: tried curing in grove bags yes i have i
put them in the grove bags heat sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: them and put them into a wine fridge okay
so that's what i used for curing i
[SPEAKER_00]: actually put a little hygrometer in there
i did hold steady at the 62 percent is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of what i was aiming for it held
steady there didn't have any mold but i
[SPEAKER_00]: was just using it really for curing i know
some people are using it for drying as
[SPEAKER_00]: well i think i haven't used over drying
though the problem with where i live is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very hot here right now it's uh well
geez in here it's about 78 degrees usually
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere between 75 78 degrees fahrenheit
that's not great for storage and i spent
[SPEAKER_00]: many many years just storing in room
temperature and uh yeah month two months
[SPEAKER_00]: later buds just bland you know the flavor
is uh depleted it's uh volatized it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gone so i storage temperature has kind of
been something that i've been more
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on between the can of troll using
that for storage that's good to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature down and also the wine fridge
some people put in refrigerators i've had
[SPEAKER_00]: to put in refrigerators as well that
that's down to about 40 degrees fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_00]: so all those are things that i've tried to
end up at storage temperature for curing
[SPEAKER_00]: curing slash storage but the grove bags
worked pretty good you know i don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any complaints on them used them for a
very short period of time i will tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: that though you just keep in the fridge
what temperature are you storing at on the
[SPEAKER_00]: regular usually about 60 60 degrees
fahrenheit is what i have my wine fridge
[SPEAKER_00]: set to i have the uh i have the can of
troll set to it and then i bumped i've
[SPEAKER_00]: been playing around with a little bit
between 60 and 65 and to be honest with
[SPEAKER_00]: you i haven't noticed a whole lot of uh
difference between 60 and 65 as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: storage temperature fridge yeah like i
mentioned goes down to about 40 degrees it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually varies between um for me for the
way i have my fridge set at everybody you
[SPEAKER_00]: know there's a dial where you can adjust
it but my range is between i think 34 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 degrees fahrenheit is kind of what that
range is but uh yeah sometimes when i have
[SPEAKER_00]: to when i when i'm drying in my can of
troll i gotta put it elsewhere some of it
[SPEAKER_00]: fits in the wine fridge last resort is the
actual regular fridge better than room
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature that's for sure have you tried
the bottled organic nutrients having some
[SPEAKER_00]: success with the bio and outline yes i
have i use bloom yellow bottles oh and by
[SPEAKER_00]: the way in regards to answering questions
about products yeah if people ask them i
[SPEAKER_00]: will answer them i know at least a q a
video on my channel and there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the questions had to do with products and
somebody in the comment section it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple people i think comment section like
hey why are you just talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: products all the time what is this an
infomercial it's like i'm just answering
[SPEAKER_00]: questions here you got questions about
products i'll answer them you know so uh
[SPEAKER_00]: but this episode actually has been a lot
of plant questions so those people won't
[SPEAKER_00]: be as much of keyboard warriors this time
around i'm sure but bloom yellow bottles
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah i use them that line i had some good
results in but there's just so many
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles in that line that was just a major
turn off for me it was just the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles there and it's very expensive
although it's a very concentrated line so
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to use much there's just
there's a lot of bottles and it adds up
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly so yeah i had pretty good
luck with that i haven't used any other
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle organic nutrients what can i use
for silica other than rice holes and
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles good question i mean diatomaceous
earth is some silica in there but i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how many people use it as an
amendment for silica stash blend has got
[SPEAKER_00]: it right chainless plug stash blends got
some silica in there so you could pick up
[SPEAKER_00]: a bag of stash blend and then it's
powdered form so uh longer shelf life than
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid mix it up into water and then uh
soil drench and yeah and get silica that
[SPEAKER_00]: way but yeah rice halls kind of bottled
forms or seem to be the most popular forms
[SPEAKER_00]: of silica trying to think of other
amendments off top my head let me know in
[SPEAKER_00]: the comments what am i missing i'm missing
something here what kind of pots do you
[SPEAKER_00]: use i've been using the 10 gallon fabric
pots i use the living soil fabric pots by
[SPEAKER_00]: grassroots fabric pots they have actually
have a discount code mr grow it if you get
[SPEAKER_00]: anything off of them but uh they're the
fabric pots with the liner in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: there so living soil you know when you're
growing organically out in nature the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't dry out from all angles like it
does with the normal fabric pot right so
[SPEAKER_00]: they have the liner in their fabric pots
so it just really dries out from the top
[SPEAKER_00]: down there is some fabric on the bottom
part where you can get some drying off
[SPEAKER_00]: from the bottom there as well a little bit
but that actually adds aeration in there
[SPEAKER_00]: so i've been using the 10 gallon pots from
them and i like them for that i was using
[SPEAKER_00]: seven gallon plastic i mean used so much
over the years five gallon three gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: but uh over the past three four years ish
pots have been getting bigger and um i've
[SPEAKER_00]: been growing organic what is the best way
to lower ppm when using gh well you could
[SPEAKER_00]: just do a lower dosage so when you're
mixing up your nutrients in water you can
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of doing a full dose according to
the feeding schedule some people do a half
[SPEAKER_00]: dose quarter dose so on and so forth if
you got into the point where you've
[SPEAKER_00]: actually added in the nutrients already
mixed them up and then put the tds tester
[SPEAKER_00]: in there to see the ppm or or ec meter to
see the ec realize it was too high and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like oh no i don't want this to be
this strong a lot of people just dilute
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll just add in water dilute that mix
down to their desired ec or ppm before
[SPEAKER_00]: watering in so not sure if you thought of
that but uh i think it was worth
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioning you feel like you water more in
fabric yes yeah absolutely for me i mean
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm just straight fabric pots not talking
about the grassroots living soil pots that
[SPEAKER_00]: i mentioned earlier for sure it definitely
dries out at all angles that i'm watering
[SPEAKER_00]: more often there's more aeration you know
so it's it's normal i live in a very dry
[SPEAKER_00]: climate it's 35% rh here right now in this
room and so i'm always adding in humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: with the humidifier for example but yeah
definitely watering more in fabric that's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the reasons why i've opted you've
seen a lot of my videos over the recent
[SPEAKER_00]: years it's using a lot of plastic using
plastic pots i like to be able to wash
[SPEAKER_00]: them out and reuse them too you know i
mean i know you can do that with the
[SPEAKER_00]: fabric you can wash those out and reuse
them and stuff but uh plastic pots have
[SPEAKER_00]: been working fine for me so i've kind of
haven't really been using fabric pots
[SPEAKER_00]: besides the living soil pots that i
mentioned best way to lower ppm week three
[SPEAKER_00]: of edge runoff at 1800 how's the plants
look plants look okay just water for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while water only for a little while until
you get the ppm where you want it but 1800
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't too crazy so people go upwards of of
2000 ppm assuming you're talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 scale tds tester when you talk about
the ppm that's more common unless you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in europe i know a lot of folks to the 700
scale but just water you know water for
[SPEAKER_00]: the future times the medium needs it and
then you'll see that it'll eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: lower down now if your plants are
struggling that's a different story right
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people that play them don't flush
you know so i'm not sure if using
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic organic inputs that would uh
make a difference there as well
