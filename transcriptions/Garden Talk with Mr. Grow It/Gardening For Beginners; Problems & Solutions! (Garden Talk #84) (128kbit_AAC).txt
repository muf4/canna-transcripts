[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have people that are growing synthetic
and they're still, you know, coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: with the same outcome as you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I stay kind of open-minded in that
aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not opposed to synthetic or
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think one is better than the
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting around 5.8 is being optimal to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always like right away I'm mixing
my nutrient solution and I'm pHing it
[SPEAKER_01]: right to 5.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I like to do everything for my
phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: All lights and everything are hooked up to
smart plugs where I could just control it
[SPEAKER_01]: from my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like I get notifications if
something's down, if the Wi-Fi goes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I know like, hey, this light isn't
going to cut on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to manually go do it because
something just happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like an outage happened in my area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we'll ever maintain what's
perfect to us because as soon as we hit
[SPEAKER_01]: what we think is perfect, then there's
going to be another goal set in stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're always going to be chasing
something as far as perfect goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Dusa Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have been gardening for a couple
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like talking to gardeners
with one to two years of experience
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's somewhat of a fresh set of
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like things can be learned from
that and new approaches can potentially be
[SPEAKER_00]: identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think it can be helpful for
beginner growers hearing about potential
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they can come across and solutions to
those problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to get into in
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, one thing I'd like to do with
all guests is an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you said, Dusa Farms, I've been
gardening just under two years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come December, it'll be two years exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into it literally just kind of like
everybody gets into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not everybody, I'll say,
but I wanted to yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked already, but I was like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just get pounds and pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I went with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started growing right away,
quickly learned that not everything is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be what you expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started the YouTube right away for the
first grow, which is kind of, I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: it keeps me true to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the critics out there, not a lot of
people, the viewers, the first episode I
[SPEAKER_01]: state that I'm a new grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after that, people quickly,
they don't know they're tuning in maybe in
[SPEAKER_01]: my week four video.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't know like, hey,
this is his first grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, oh, you suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just battling, just starting right off
with YouTube right away and then going
[SPEAKER_01]: through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's pretty much as far as like
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've, I try to like, I got into
the content creation because I'm like more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a, I've always, I used to game and I
was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was already wanting to do YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me do the same thing and apply that to
the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start a channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was already watching people
like yourself, Mr. Knugs, pigeons,
[SPEAKER_01]: CLTV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was already watching a lot of these
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, well, let me just start my
own and let me start it from day one and
[SPEAKER_01]: let everybody just see my growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm maybe, you know, on the same,
you know, as far as subscribers are level
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever, like when I'm 200 subscribers
in, people are looking back like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, look at those, like this is where he
started at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, he's come a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so I can go that, you know,
it kind of motivates people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if I, if I show them that
they'll be like, okay, not everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: starts as being the best or whatever,
but I feel like that's where I can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: come into play and just show my progress
through that in the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly have to be somewhat brave in
order to upload your grow to the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure, you're going to get a ton of
haters, backseat growers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the words that people who just
tell you how to grow your plants without
[SPEAKER_00]: you even asking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like for like the community in general,
I feel like, I feel like it's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: positive for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say like 99%.
[SPEAKER_01]: With 1% being like negative here and
there, which I hear a lot of people say
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we can all agree that is pretty
positive for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then you go into a gaming page and
you see a lot of hate under those comments
[SPEAKER_01]: or people that do pranks, you'll see a lot
of hate under the comments and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems to go pretty well for our
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this morning I get one, it's people
like, Oh, if I, you know, if I grew for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if I grew plants for this long
and yielded this much, like I killed
[SPEAKER_01]: myself or, you know, like the typical hay,
but I get one this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I, like I said, I try to keep
things pretty transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to show everything, you know,
being a content creator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know sometimes things can get lost in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might not record everything,
but when it comes to growing plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I put the days in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put where I'm at on the footage and
someone sees like I'm in veg during my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants growth at day 89.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, no way you're,
you know, a good grower can never be great
[SPEAKER_01]: growing like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I never claimed I was good
nor great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, but I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, they're like, I lost all
respect from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay, that's a silly way to
lose respect for someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, to each its own,
you have a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, the community is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of positive people,
99% positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, that's besides the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's cool that you're actually a
content creator now and you're uploading
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow to YouTube so people can view
and, you know, show off what you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe ask for advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the reasons why I got
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what would you say is your gardening
style, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different ways to grow
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you indoors, outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you organic, synthetic, soil,
cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I am an indoor, I am an indoor
gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done any outdoor yet as much as
I would love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not like once I move into my
house, once I buy my house, I do plan to
[SPEAKER_01]: do some outdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as of right now, I've only done
indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as my style, I feel like,
I like to say I try to keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes, you know, I have to keep it
as simple as I can, because I do record
[SPEAKER_01]: video, I do footage, you know,
but at the same time, I have to like do
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things here and there to show the
audience things that I wouldn't normally
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's just adding the camera to the
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying like I'm just doing
something because of the camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have to add certain things here
and there just to make you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm battling to you know, I'm fighting two
fights, I'm trying to make sure I get some
[SPEAKER_01]: footage for this and make sure I garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but I do try to keep it as simple as
possible to make that happening to add in
[SPEAKER_01]: the YouTube stuff and the content
creation, making that a little bit easier
[SPEAKER_01]: and just having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I do try to keep it as simple as
possible and have as much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic and synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've only done synthetic I did I want
to do organic because a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my take on organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I do have some guy green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have guy green on my shelf and I did
try to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel about people that some people
that do organic gardening is they there's
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a few of them out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like when I first found out about the
organic gardening, I see a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: are like, pushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a few of them out there where
they're just like, that's the only way you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, that's the best way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they put so much faith in everything
into it, which you know, I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: organic, I feel like you should try to be
as organic as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just to me, I've related to
people that do keto in the fitness world
[SPEAKER_01]: for for the viewers out there that into
fitness and know about people that are on
[SPEAKER_01]: the keto diet, you know, some people that
are on the keto diet, they'll like really
[SPEAKER_01]: push keto, like it's the only way to get
in shape, the only way to lose body fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I relate that to some of
the people that do organic gardening,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's just like, those two
personalities, like some of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes they can get like, feel like
that's the only way well, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have people that are growing
synthetic, and they're still, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out with the same outcome as you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I stay kind of open minded in that
aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm not opposed to synthetic or
organic, I don't think one is better than
[SPEAKER_01]: the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, they both they both get the job
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I would like to do organic just for
the sake of, you know, cutting back on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the footprint
[SPEAKER_01]: of pollution and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are only two, you know,
bottle nutrients I've used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did start off with one of my grows right
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the first cocoa grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm going to do organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really wanted to do organic just to say
I've done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to try everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see what exactly works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can because I don't know what I like
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know what I like currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a year from now, I might not like
what you know, I might not like the same
[SPEAKER_01]: growth style, I might have a totally
different growth style might think this
[SPEAKER_01]: product is way better than that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started I bought the guy green,
got some cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew my plants, you know, I started them
in a humidity dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they got to a certain size,
they were already kind of showing some
[SPEAKER_01]: like they needed some nutrients,
they were showing a little deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, all right, go and get them
transplanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could start, you know, top dressing
and feeding them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I didn't know an organic with
organic with organic gardening and top
[SPEAKER_01]: dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes like a week, maybe like around a
week to break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I put them in there, that,
you know, they're going through that shock
[SPEAKER_01]: of transplant, I don't see any signs of
recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, oh, what is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm asking people, they said, yeah,
you should have like, went ahead and top
[SPEAKER_01]: dressed it before putting them in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the nutrients are readily available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, you know what, maybe not
this run, maybe the next run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I just mixed up some bottle
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, and they bounced back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know, synthetic or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they definitely take time to break
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a common mistake that folks
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another common mistake would be to keep
the medium moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of folks don't do that when they're
growing organic and there needs to be that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in there for proper nutrient
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so common technique when growing
with synthetic or bottled nutrients would
[SPEAKER_00]: be to let the medium dry out between
waterings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll feed their plants, let the
medium dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it's at a certain point,
they will water in their plants again,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then kind of repeat that cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'd be doing dry backs or somewhat
drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you can say, which can be
beneficial to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with organics, you could seriously be
missing the boat on things as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown and not providing the proper
nutrition to the plants because the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients aren't available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think that's a great tip to
some people call that like charging the
[SPEAKER_00]: media or letting the media cook for a
while for that breakdown to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's definitely could be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, taking a look back at the last two
years that you've been gardening,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would you say has been your biggest
challenge that you've come across?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for my biggest challenge, I would say
is really just chasing that being too hard
[SPEAKER_01]: on myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I feel like that kind of sums
it up because a lot of us, we are our
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest, we are our biggest critic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I was, you know,
stressing, letting comments get to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: letting, you know, he say she say,
just letting that affect me at first,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, outside of I'm already doubting
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already feeling like I suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, add in some other
negative stuff from the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like other people see that I can't
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I kind of like sat there and it's
like, I can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, this person's doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This person's doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't I?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so I just feel like, you know,
really just being that critic,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just kind of like appreciating,
like I just did a post on Instagram where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I was talking about it was,
it was an Instagram real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the, it was kind of just,
like I said, when you're hard on you,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you thought your harvest was the
worst, but everybody's like saying it's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just like surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, is it good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know, but like everybody's
telling you it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, okay, like I did a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just that, that self doubt and
just chasing perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, you know, everybody wants
that, you know, the perfect run and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just going to be like in the rock of
eternity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll just continuously, you know,
chase perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we'll ever maintain what's
perfect to us because as soon as we hit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what we think is perfect,
then there's going to be another goal set
[SPEAKER_01]: in stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're always going to be chasing
something as far as perfect goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can totally relate to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now have you come across any like
deficiencies or toxicities in your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: over the past couple of years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for deficiencies and toxicities,
um, I came across like, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the typical, like a nitrogen
deficiency deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first it was hard for me, especially
being a new grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the best at identifying stuff
right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like now, as you go through them,
like it's hard to relate to Google and
[SPEAKER_01]: tell Google like, Hey, um, my plant's leaf
is this, like, you know, Google can't see
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm over here trying to explain to
Google, but I'm a new grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know these certain terminology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to use certain words.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, Hey, the leaf is yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to explain like it's
wilting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I don't, I don't even think to
use that word wilting and just really like
[SPEAKER_01]: relate it to where I could find an article
and be like, okay, this is the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so I've run into like a nitrogen
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've run into like a, you know,
low light, having low light, light,
[SPEAKER_01]: light deficiency because, uh, my lights
went out and I was just kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: taking a step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know, I'm not going to
breathe down the plant's neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like the day I take a step back,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all my lights are automatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when that, when I took that step back,
I didn't go in there and check them for
[SPEAKER_01]: like two, three days, come back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, Oh, the lights are
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking at the plants,
got some, you know, yelling at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, okay, turn, as soon as the
light kicks back on, they're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bounce back as far as other
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have run into, I've run into like a,
uh, was it pH, uh, I've run into like a
[SPEAKER_01]: lockout.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've run into like a nutrient lockout,
uh, due to pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, when I ran into that,
I didn't really, I didn't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it was hard for me to really tell
what I was running into when I,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I originally started in soil and
there was a lot of mistakes I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't check my runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think it was that important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Hey, this is what I'm phing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I'm running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything should be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's going into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's coming out of it,
you know, is that, the same, what I put
[SPEAKER_01]: into it is that what's coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ran into stuff like that nutrient
buildup, um, you know, the salt buildup
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff, and the plants just not being
able to absorb getting, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants burning, uh, wilting and just
kind of dying off that way because they
[SPEAKER_01]: just don't have the optimal environment
because I'm allowing them to sit and
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much, you know, a terrible
condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I kind of, I kind of gave up on
soil because I didn't know that and
[SPEAKER_01]: started DWC, which is, whew, I was like,
it was a different ballpark right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, but that actually helped me
figure out like, because, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and DWC, you don't have, uh, the runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have an actual runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's in that reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even in our DWC, I mean, the runoff is
circulating throughout everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water's just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's moving through bubbles and
stuff like that, but there is no runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing, no drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I realized I started running into
problems in DWC, I kind of related that
[SPEAKER_01]: back to soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, wait, you know, I'm,
my pH is rising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or PPM is rising in a DWC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, maybe I was running into
like some problems with soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ran another soil plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I check.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, start checking the runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I realized I was like,
I'm overfeeding, you know, that I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know how big the runoff was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was to see people say like,
Hey, check your runoff, but I didn't think
[SPEAKER_01]: it was important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ran into, uh, you know, I had to
learn the hard way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I haven't run into too many
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the times it's literally just like
some sort of nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, the cow mag is, uh,
especially since I'm growing a,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, cocoa now, which I learned that
through one of the garden talk,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, episodes, I didn't realize the cocoa
actually like pulls some of that cow mag
[SPEAKER_01]: and it kind of like takes you have to like
up the cow mag a little bit when growing
[SPEAKER_01]: in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that at first, but I w I
previously watched one of your garden talk
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes like a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I found out and huge difference
in the grow right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned low light deficiency and I
think what you're actually referring to
[SPEAKER_00]: this first time I ever heard anybody say
low light deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I said it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think what you're referring to is
actually iron deficiency and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something super, super common.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it is is basically it's a yellowing
that starts at the, from the petiole so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they'll get the base of the leaf and
it works its way up to the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that a lot with new growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned that like your lights
were off for a day or two or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you, you opened up your tent and
then you noticed that the yellow growing
[SPEAKER_00]: this happened at the top of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just hasn't received the light in order
to convert it to green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically what will happen is you put
your lights back on and with a matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: hours, you'll see those leaves turn from
yellow to green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see this a lot with new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will, they'll have their,
their seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll sprout from the medium once the
lights are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the lights will come on and
they'll open up their tent and they'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, why is my, why is my seedling
yellow, completely yellow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I underfeeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: But little did I know, all they needed was
that little bit of light and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: convert over to green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was a good call out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it a lot in the stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like after you flip the plant to flowering
those first three weeks, sometimes you get
[SPEAKER_00]: really heavy stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when your lights are off for that
12 hour period, for example, when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing photo period plants, you'll see
right when you turn the lights on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you open up your tent, you'll see there's
some yellowing on the top leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's no problem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just with the new growth,
it'll start off yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not receiving light right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's totally perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it a little bit simpler because I
know whenever, whenever I get to flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that they're stretching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they're demanding a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with it being like that, I always seem
like I got some yellow growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Hey, maybe I need to take this
picture from like a different angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people aren't just like, Oh,
your plants look yellow, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I didn't really think about the fact
that, uh, that's, I know in flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really typically worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh, it's common.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the time when I was in,
when it was happening in veg, I was like
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting there like, Oh, it's the lights
being out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm actually, I'm, I'm glad to know
that it's actually the, from the iron and
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants ability to like actually break
it down and turn green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy fix on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a common misconception for,
for growers, for new growers, I should
[SPEAKER_00]: say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you also mentioned pH lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is there a specific pH range that
you're aiming for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: With, um, when I was running soil,
I was, I think I was fluctuating anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: between 6.2 and 6.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I'm no longer a slow, slow grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, probably the only time I'll ever grow
in soil again is maybe outside eventually,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't really plan on doing so
anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but for me, I'm all hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm running cocoa, just started my
first cocoa run and then DWC and same DWC
[SPEAKER_01]: and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting around five, my 5.8 is being
optimal to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm always like right away,
I'm mixing my nutrient solution and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: pHing it right to 5.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's why I, that's why I try to
stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let it fluctuate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may bring it down to somewhere around
5.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a lot of people recommend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes I'll, you know, let it go
down to 5.5 or, you know, 6.2 being high,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I typically just 5.8 throughout the
entire thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always had good luck in cocoa in
particular doing 5.8 pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll mix up my nutrients in my
reservoir, pH it to 5.8 and then give that
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I've always had just really good
growth, really good luck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's no surprise that you're having
good luck as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually starting off in cocoa say,
I'm going to call back to another one of
[SPEAKER_01]: your, uh, episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same exact episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not remember his name, but he was
talking about cocoa and I feel bad for not
[SPEAKER_01]: know his name, but it's probably doggo the
hut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was watching, I was watching that
video and me, I previously ran soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking cocoa was the same thing as
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I didn't really think I needed
to look anything up different for cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, I, you know, I know what
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just go in there and pH into around 6.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, uh, that's what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was still kind of like having some,
the growth wasn't what I thought it would
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just things were being a little off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everything should be going well
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then I'm watching that,
uh, watching that episode on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found out, I was like 5.8 when,
when you start doing five, I was like
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much the same because of my plants
and DWC were at the same growth stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, I'm making two batches of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing 5.8 for my DWC, but going to do
6.5 for cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after watching episode, I was like,
I could have saved myself so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much time by just doing one,
you know, one reservoir full of 5.8 and
[SPEAKER_01]: then just doing, I'm just saving myself so
much time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started doing 5.8 right away after
that episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, I was like, you know,
5.8 from here on out, it's all 5.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now have you mixed anything in with the
cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some people will take the cocoa and I
don't know if you're using brick or the
[SPEAKER_00]: bagged cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people will take that and they'll
mix in like some form of aeration,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be like perlite or pomace or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing any of that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I have also seen some people say
that I've actually been doing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just doing the cocoa bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the FloraFlex cocoa bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just found that to be like super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was looking online, I didn't have a
store near me that just carried cocoa or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe they didn't carry the cocoa that I
would like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, you know what, go online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at prices and I was like,
you know what, I keep seeing these
[SPEAKER_01]: FloraFlex cocoa bags and just other
different varieties, but I kept seeing the
[SPEAKER_01]: FloraFlex ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, you know what, I'm going to
try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had reptiles before I've messed with
bricks of cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should be the same, you know,
concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the cocoa bricks and I just pretty
much, you know, prepped them that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't add anything to it, just left
them exactly how they were and just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because they come dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just put, add some moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They expanded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there I just kept it at
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you didn't do any rinsing or buffering
of the brick?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's common technique that people do is
they'll rinse it out because it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these come with a lot high salt content
and that's really not needed for plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me take that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some plants that can take sodium,
but some of these cocoa bricks just have
[SPEAKER_00]: an excess amount of sodium in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll rinse that out and then they'll
buffer it in with like those, they'll soak
[SPEAKER_00]: the brick in with Cal Mag, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that basically the cocoa particles
retain cations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of it like a magnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that calcium magnesium, those are
cations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stick to those cocoa particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you do any rinsing or buffering or was
it straight out of the brick that you just
[SPEAKER_00]: grew in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, roll right, right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I kind of rinsed a little bit
because I had a friend, they told me as
[SPEAKER_01]: soon as they saw that I had the cocoa
bricks, I was like, Hey, I'm getting ready
[SPEAKER_01]: to do these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that he had already done some cocoa
in the past, the same floor flex bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hits me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like right away, he's like,
Hey, make sure you like really,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, rinsing them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they, like you said, the salt,
he said they're pretty high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I get them, they're always at
like a already at like a three,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, three, uh, three EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, I was sitting there nervous
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, uh, um, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did kind of rinse it in a way right
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but once I like got it, I didn't rinse
it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of filled the bags up and I
had a lot of runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of got rinsed out, but I didn't
really stress it, uh, rinsing too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll check the runoff after,
you know, water my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I seen that everything, what I was
putting in, it was roughly around the
[SPEAKER_01]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't have to worry about that too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was nervous about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he told me that I was like,
Oh no, I like, I'm going to like burn my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants or you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like all the salt build up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like super nervous about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did a little bit of rinsing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you talked about pH a little bit,
but let's get into EC and PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing that people will
check, whether it be the EC or PPM of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution going in or the runoff
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you monitoring the EC or PPM at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, with DWC, I was, I, I monitored it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to monitor daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would constantly go in there and check
daily, but then that kind of gets played
[SPEAKER_01]: out when I have like seven different
buckets and I'm having, I don't have RDWC,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm checking seven individual buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was kind of like, once I stopped,
like I took a step back, I stopped
[SPEAKER_01]: stressing that portion so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I constantly checking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that was my, uh, that's what I was
under the interpretation that like I
[SPEAKER_01]: literally had to check it every day and I
had to make sure everything stayed in
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but once I kind of like, you know,
I check it every, I check it two,
[SPEAKER_01]: three times a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really stressing it as much as far
as the DWC, uh, COCO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime I see some runoff, you know,
I'll, I'll check the runoff just to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I don't, I don't typically check
it all too often for the PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go by PPM, uh, not the EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel like PPM is just, to me,
EC is just like the smaller number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the PPM to me is just,
it's a lot easier to, uh, understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know, I'll just stay
with PPM because some, some people,
[SPEAKER_01]: like some people only do EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll refer to everything as EC and
like, I just, I just don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I could look at a chart and like,
you know, look at a side by side
[SPEAKER_01]: comparison, like, okay, this PPM should be
around this EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I don't, I don't typically refer
to the EC at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though my meter does check EC,
I just stick strictly PPM, which I do
[SPEAKER_01]: check, uh, the DWC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure, you know,
if my, if it's lowering, if the PPM is
[SPEAKER_01]: lowering, I'm like, okay, everything's
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants absorbing those nutrients
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if the PPM is rising, I'm like,
hold on, something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, maybe I need to feed a little bit
lower dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe something else is going on for the,
you know, maybe then, uh, the mix wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe something was just off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's some sort of problems
where the plants not absorbing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to, I do check it, uh,
here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do try to check my PPM and stay on top
of it, but I'm not stressing it as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: I did right away when I first started.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are conversion charts that you
can Google and find EC to PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some people use EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say one way is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one way is wrong, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's a conversion of the other,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also 500 scale and 700 scale
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to be careful there and
know what your meter is, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 scale TDS tester or a 700 scale TDS
tester, because those are different
[SPEAKER_00]: calculations from EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like that, I just learned
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I think it's Europe is usually
using 700 scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: US, I think it's a mix between 700 and the
500 scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the best way to go about it,
in my opinion, is to contact the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying off Amazon, for example,
sometimes it'll, somebody will ask that
[SPEAKER_00]: question in the question section on the
Amazon listing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I'll search that to see if
they reveal if it's 500 scale or 700
[SPEAKER_00]: scale, or you can ask the question,
see if somebody responds or just contact
[SPEAKER_00]: the manufacturer and they'll tell you
what, what scale it's on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, also since we talked about the
pH, just to touch back on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, because I talked about it with the
PPM, but, uh, for my pH, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keeping it at 5.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I used to stress it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I already said, I was trying to make
sure my every, every day it had to be at
[SPEAKER_01]: 5.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm constantly, you know, adding pH up or
pH down to make sure in my DWC system that
[SPEAKER_01]: it was at 5.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I stopped on the, my two previous
grows, I stopped like doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just let it, I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I start day one, I prep my, you know,
I prep my nutrient solution, add it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, I just, I was like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I check it the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it went from 5.8 to like 6.3.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Whoa, what is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, DWC it's common.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, but I was fighting the urge to pH
it back down to 5.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna, I'm gonna see what happens the
next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at six.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like almost like 6.1, 6.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then by time I just let it go
until the next water change, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: like a week later, I come in there to
change the water was at 5.9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, okay, the plant,
you know, the plants gonna, it fluctuates
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know, the plant, it didn't seem
like anything was wrong with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I don't really chase my pH at all
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I check it still, but I'm not really
chasing it to make sure it stays at 5.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of let them fluctuate and do their
own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as there's no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of water are you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I, I'm right now for the water,
I'm using tap water, uh, which my tap
[SPEAKER_01]: water comes out pH around 7.6,
7.7.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, um, with the PPM being around
one 37 actually just I'm actually doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: video today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just checked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's at one 37.
[SPEAKER_01]: As of today, my PPM was at one 37.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to do some, uh, RO,
uh, reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I see like you do a RO and a lot of
people do RO, but I was like, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in an apartment right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to set up, you know,
that I was like, you know, I'll wait till
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to my more permanent spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I get to the house, once I buy the
house, I'll start running some RO.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as of right now, I've only ran top
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in particular, when you're in
cocoa, how do you know when to water?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you use to determine?
[SPEAKER_01]: When to water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm watering, uh, at first I was,
I didn't need to, I thought I was needing
[SPEAKER_01]: water to run off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't have like the best drainage
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have them in flood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have like a flood table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have them in flood trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have, you know, seven different cocoa
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm having to, you know, keep moving
plants out of the way and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just move the plants and then dump the
actual tray out itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that can kind of become a little work
when, especially as the plants get bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try not to do too much as far as the,
uh, the runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still do get runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just try to make sure I don't get too
much runoff, but I'll still move the trays
[SPEAKER_01]: and drain them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or actually I have like some suction,
uh, that I'll just get all the water up
[SPEAKER_01]: with like a shop vac so I don't have to
move the plants around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I started at first, I was only
watering maybe once a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as of recently, the plants
started up, they started intaking a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start really around like week three,
around week three of veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really start picking up the
consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from there ever since then I've been
doing two times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I do it right, uh, right a little bit
after lights on and then right at lights
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been running it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far it's been good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the runoff, I don't really get too
much runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I come in there, sometimes I knew
I've had to start increasing the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the amount of water I've given them so
far, because sometimes I come in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: it will be, the cocoa will be a little bit
more dry than it was the day before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, hold on, let me,
now I need to start adding more because
[SPEAKER_01]: we're in that, uh, I'm still in that
stretching phase of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been, you know, up in the water,
but I still do two, uh, two times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A common question that you get from
beginners a lot is how much water do I add
[SPEAKER_00]: in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the answer to that is just,
it depends, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many variables when it comes to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size is the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watering a small seedling,
you're obviously going to give it less
[SPEAKER_00]: water than you would a full blown plant
that is in the flowering stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always get that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hard to answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You usually have to find out more
information about how far along is the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What container size?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it in how moist is the medium to begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, there's just so many factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so hard to answer that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get asked that, like, I've been asked
that a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like, how often should I water?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I would like explain,
break everything down to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need all their information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, how, you know, your light,
the light intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, do you have any fans going or the fans
blowing directly at it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is it drying up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what's going on with, what is the life
stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, me starting off,
I've, I got a seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to just like, just gouge it
with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I don't need that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wasting my nutrients at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've got to be, you know,
save as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, you don't, you don't need
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like you said, there's so many
factors that come into play and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where we, you know, just got to relay that
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so I can kind of help you in because
I can only see so much from like a camera
[SPEAKER_01]: or just from the message that you said,
like, it's so vague, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to break it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to get it because I'm not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to really give me that
information so I could try to help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm still learning myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing that can really help is the
moisture meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you used one of those
before, but you can buy one of those up
[SPEAKER_00]: for like 10 bucks, 15 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those work pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some mixed results on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do need to calibrate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the digital moisture meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know sustainable village makes a digital
moisture meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the company that makes blue mats,
the automated drip system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I haven't used the digital one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually been wanting to get my hands on
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're around like 85 bucks or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can certainly be valuable if
you're like, if you're unsure about how
[SPEAKER_00]: much moisture is in the medium,
you can get one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you can really dial in your
watering that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't, I haven't personally,
I was looking into the moisture meters at
[SPEAKER_01]: first because I was running into problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this looks like overwatering
or this looks like underwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that media, I need to be in
that, like the perfect little area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is that at?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, I thought about buying a
moisture meter, but then I kind of just
[SPEAKER_01]: like figured it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for the sake of having it,
it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could see like maybe what I thought
was enough might not be enough or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: what I thought was too much might not be
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can certainly be helpful on that
Avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are so many different things
that we can talk about when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: environment temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically aim for in regards
to temperature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for temperature for DWC, temperature is
like a huge factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one of the factors I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top three factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put it at number one, but um,
temperature is definitely, I keep it round
[SPEAKER_01]: for, for the entire room, dependent,
like the actual room itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I aim for around like max 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but with, uh, that's when I was
running like soil or if I was just running
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa 75, but they're in the seventies
would be cool with me just keeping it in
[SPEAKER_01]: seventies in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but because of DWC, I'm having to keep
everything down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at first I was originally,
you know, making sure my entire room was
[SPEAKER_01]: like 68.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was making sure it was a 68.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes 65, you know, I was trying to
make the entire room cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way my plants roots, you know,
that way I can keep them in that,
[SPEAKER_01]: not put them arranged at temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not running into things like root
rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but then since then I've actually,
so I don't have to have the entire room,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, electric bill skyrocketing
because that AC unit is trying to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole room cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, since then move the AC unit,
cause I have all DWC plants inside of one
[SPEAKER_01]: tent and I've been able to move that AC
unit into that tent alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I keep the actual temperature around
like 65 to 68 pretty much inside that
[SPEAKER_01]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how about humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will track the relative
humidity and adjust that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific humidity that you aim
for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yes, I do typically stay, I kind of
throughout the entire process,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess starting off, I'm around like,
like for seedlings, well, they're in the
[SPEAKER_01]: dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a 90 plus, but throughout the rest
of the grow, I'm aiming, I'm just keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: that 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just keep my dehumidifier set 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if it's a super humid day and I
see like the, the water's building up
[SPEAKER_01]: where I'm going to be gone and I want the,
to extend the life, uh, because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have the dehumidifier draining outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a draining in just to a bigger
bucket, which I know it takes a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: days, but sometimes if I want it to last
just a little bit longer from going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: gone, I'll crank it up to like 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not fighting too hard to keep it
at 50%, but around 50 is where I stayed
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: General range specifically for beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we could get into VPD vapor pressures
to episode, which is the ideal humidity to
[SPEAKER_00]: be at for what temperature that you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps to ensure that the stomata
on the leaves are fully open and then
[SPEAKER_00]: taking that CO2 release that water vapor,
so on and so forth, but putting VPD to the
[SPEAKER_00]: side, the general range that is often
recommended for beginners is between 40
[SPEAKER_00]: and 60% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you could certainly stay within
that range and get to harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And staying under that 60% is generally
recommended in order to prevent things
[SPEAKER_00]: like powdery mildew from forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, now air circulation is going
to be a big impact to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of benefits to air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do for air circulation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so for my air circulation,
I'm running, I actually have a tower fan
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of one, well, on one side of the
tent, I'm running a tower fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I actually want to get more tower fans
and just run solely tower fans because I
[SPEAKER_01]: just like the, at any stage it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's still going to be blowing
an even amount of air throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I do have one tower fan and the
rest is just like, I believe like six inch
[SPEAKER_01]: osculating fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure the exact size, but I have
osculating fans and I'll have to prop them
[SPEAKER_01]: as the plants grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll have to like prop them up
on something or hang them from the
[SPEAKER_01]: ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as of right now, that's like the only
thing I'm running for fans and osculating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, well, I have a air pulling out
from the AC infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have that pulling air out,
but as far as fans goes, it's just a few
[SPEAKER_01]: osculating fans and a tower fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently I've been using the AC
infinity clip on fans that clip onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the grow tent and oscillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get, I want to get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it because it makes it so you can
just right onto a pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have four of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, the way of positioning
the fans in your grow space is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that not a lot of people talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people say there is a right and a
wrong way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not here to say that this is the,
there is a right way and a wrong way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a common technique people will do is
they'll put like two, two of those clip on
[SPEAKER_00]: fans towards the lower part of their grow
tent, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's blowing underneath the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the other side of the grow
tent up more, they'll have the fans
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing above the canopy or through the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this constant whirl around in
the actual grow tent or grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some people will just, they'll say,
Oh, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can just position them any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So air is just whipping around in all the
different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of different ways to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may say one way is better than the
other, but both ways is going to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: move the air around so that the plant does
have access to that CO2, which is needed
[SPEAKER_00]: for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then yeah, air exchange, like you
talked about, I'm using the AC infinity
[SPEAKER_00]: one as well, where it's just, it's so
awesome being able to be hooked up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's actually on your phone as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually control the airflow on
your phone with the controller 69.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a Bluetooth edition,
a wifi edition, which I just got my hands
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes things a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause right now I'm just running with the
remote, but I definitely want to get one
[SPEAKER_01]: where I'm able to control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I like to do everything for my
phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: All lights and everything are hooked up to
smart plugs where I could just control it
[SPEAKER_01]: from my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I get notifications if
something's down, if the wifi goes out,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I know like, Hey, this light isn't
going to cut on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to manually go do it because maybe
something, something just happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like an outage happened in my area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know I need to prep for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of gives me that less,
less thing to worry about when I'm away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also have like a camera hooked
up so I can like kind of watch just in
[SPEAKER_01]: case I'm like, Oh, it looks like there's a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember back in the day,
none of that stuff existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, open up the tent and you know,
disturbing that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I live in a very dry climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like opening up the tent,
humidity is escaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing a drop in humidity and you
know, closing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so much easier to just be able to
look at the phone and see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity is there or
looking at the camera and being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: see that the plants are okay, that the
lights are on like they should be so on
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, automation is just.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some people against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I know some people prefer like
everything manual because like those
[SPEAKER_01]: factors, like power outages and stuff,
but it's, I guess it's just the
[SPEAKER_01]: generation, but it just, I like,
like, I like to make life easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to, I like to enjoy everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very tech savvy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on a 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I could add one more thing to this,
to make that just a little bit easier,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I'm cool with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, I did use the, for timers at first,
I didn't know smart plugs were a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just went and had seen the ones where
you, it's like a dial and you just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you pull, you just pull the pins out,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty much just, it's what you
just plug in solid and it just spins until
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets to that dial and then it cuts off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did use that at first, but I was
like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I prefer to like see the time
and know exactly which time it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: cut on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that those timers,
you know, went from, from that style to
[SPEAKER_00]: the digital style, which I still use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of people using the smart
plugs now that I don't even use timers
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those digital timers that are made
specifically for, you know, hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I feel like eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now they have, I've seen recently
speaking on automation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seen a, Hey Abby, I'm not sure if you're
familiar with that, but it's pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: a, it's a DWC system and it's pretty much
a full setup, like tent, a light is inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the size of maybe like a two by
two tent, maybe smaller than that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's pretty much just for one plant or
you can probably run smaller plants inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of it where they may have different sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen one and it's, it's fairly
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a thousand bucks, but it's
literally a whole automatic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything temperature controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has AC built in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is just automatic about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can control everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feed it from your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just put like little food type pods
inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, all right, that's like
another step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was like, I would try it out if it
was like reasonably priced, but I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, ah, I'm not paying that much just
to, you know, put a thousand bucks into
[SPEAKER_01]: one plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm, I'm cool on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't need to go that far into
automation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not that lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not that lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know, there have been a handful of
those systems out there in the past decade
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, all of them suck for,
for, uh, medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean lettuce, you know, or leafy greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, people have been trying these
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been in the thousands of dollars and
realize, Hey, it's better to just spend a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand dollars on a grow tank kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it is to send on one automated
box, which yeah, it's supposed to control
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reservoir in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lighting in there, but they're all
just terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't even look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I get like a little, the person I've
seen the video from, they like show inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at like the aeration,
the bubble output.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, it's most likely going to
run into root rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, he's going to run into root
rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go back to the lighting issue
you talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever had like a power outage that
you had to deal with at all or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as, as far as longterm, like for some
reason, like, you know, there comes,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's times I was like maybe a week
where it'll happen like a couple of times,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it'll like be quickly back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one time where my lights were
out for maybe a two, three hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point after like, usually when
they go out there out for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes and they may just pop right back
up within like five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they were out for like after like
30 minutes of being out, I'm sitting there
[SPEAKER_01]: like, okay, anytime now hour, I'm just
like, I don't see it storming outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why was the power out?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just, I was sitting there like
super nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, ah, no, like this is like,
what do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't have a generator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any sort to get my lights
back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with DWC, if I have like soil
plants, they can make it a couple of days
[SPEAKER_01]: with no light and bounce back fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like power out being a DWC,
like their oxygen is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I just like sit there, grab the air
stones, just start blowing in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just sitting there like scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I don't know where to go about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but after like three hours they cut
back on, uh, I didn't actually run into
[SPEAKER_01]: root rot that run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I was surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking I was, I was like,
oh no, what is, it's the plants are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be done, but they didn't even,
they weren't even bothered.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they, they just kept growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kept doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the lights come, as soon as I heard
like the beep, I had a, I think my
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidifier, the AC unit, it beeps every
time it comes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard the beep and I was like,
yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like screamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, so excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, the power is back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since then I was like, when I move
into like a more permanent setup,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm going to like invest in
something like a generator or something
[SPEAKER_01]: where I could temporary or, you know,
just get my power back and running while
[SPEAKER_01]: the outages taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be worrisome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of people reaching out to me
talking about how their power went out and
[SPEAKER_00]: now the lights came back on and they were
off for a certain number of hours and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really worried about, well,
we know that light leaks and light
[SPEAKER_00]: interruptions cause plants to go
hermaphrodite, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the main concern for a lot of
these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, the question is, if your lights
are out for 30 minutes, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is that enough of a light
interruption in order to cause your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to herm or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some people who their lights will
be out for three, four hours and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll go right back on and their lights
will be on for three hours and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be off for the 12 hours and things
just get all out of whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: General recommendation that I've been told
and what I've been doing whenever I've
[SPEAKER_00]: encountered a power outage is if,
if the lights are off for 30 minutes or
[SPEAKER_00]: longer, you may want to consider keeping
the lights off as if you were starting
[SPEAKER_00]: your dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if your lights are off for
five hours, you have a power outage for
[SPEAKER_00]: five hours, you may just want to,
and then your power comes back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may just want to keep the lights off
for another seven hours and then you've
[SPEAKER_00]: completed your 12 hour dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're going back onto a 12 hour
light cycle and then hopefully your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't stressed out, but there's really no
firm technique that's going to say for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure, no, your plants aren't going to herm
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really becomes a tricky situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what that said with the outage,
that's, that's like one thing that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like taught me the lesson was like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: DWC, it may not be the best thing in the
world, like, cause that's how I was
[SPEAKER_01]: preaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I love DWC, but that made me
realize I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a very, you know, it needs
everything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs, it needs electricity and it
needs, it doesn't, it can't, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: go through, it can't withstand an outage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, you know, I kind of like
sorta dialed back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know, I'll do fewer
plants, fewer, bigger plants and then
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to do cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I have that buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If something like that happened,
I don't have to solely rely on
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's definitely a good way to go
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did talk about a ton of problems
that you can come across in your grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions to those problems coming up
towards the end of the episode here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions that I can ask is
getting advice for new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've been growing for a couple
of years now you've gone through kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginner stages of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may say you're still kind of in the
beginning stages, but what general advice
[SPEAKER_00]: you have for folks that are new to
gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: That main thing is going to be not,
not being that critical in yourself and
[SPEAKER_01]: really just sitting there and trying to
learn, you know, you don't have to reach
[SPEAKER_01]: out to someone and learn from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could learn from, you could learn
through just research, reading a book,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, yourself, you have a book,
you could, you know, keep it simple,
[SPEAKER_01]: really just keep everything as simple as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to know everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the biggest concern is like as
a new grower, I feel like I've reached a
[SPEAKER_01]: point where I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a big, drastic change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt, I felt new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like I didn't know anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I really just started focusing on
like, not trying to know everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: not know the terminology and just like
sitting there like it's strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to say cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to like, you know,
just, there's so much information out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need to know what I needed to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that's where it comes into
play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just know the core stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know if you can make it from seed to
harvest, you're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can, it may be a bad
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not produce the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have harvested too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have ran into several issues,
but really just learning and being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: correct those issues the next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to constantly improve and fix
those things and fix those little tweaks
[SPEAKER_01]: here and there rather than just stressing
yourself out about not knowing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just continuously keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make it simple on yourself and you're
going to save yourself a huge headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to, you can't compare
yourself to someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people, I don't have much growing
experience, but I'll have people like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I'm trying to grow like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, honestly, go watch a couple of
videos ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see I was just where you were at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you with time, you're going to
get so much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so will I.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have up
[SPEAKER_00]: on in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you can find me here on YouTube or
for viewers, not on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also find me on YouTube at
Dusafarms and you can find me on Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: at Dusafarms, D-U-S-A-F-A-R-M-S short for
Medusa, but Dusafarms as far as what
[SPEAKER_01]: what's upcoming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really just folk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do more lives and of course
more growing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm really starting to get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've hit that point where I
could teach them stuff because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching people privately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I reached a point where I
can kind of publicly say some things that
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm getting to that point where
I'm like, I'm starting to put some
[SPEAKER_01]: information that I've come across or
something that's helped me at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to avoid doing that because I didn't
want somebody to be like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: he taught me this and it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I feel like I reached a point
where I've helped enough people in private
[SPEAKER_01]: that I could publicly say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to have too many people
hit me up privately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already public information out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of that stuff's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just honestly, it's going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be getting a full room girl
set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I, once I move into a house,
I'm just going to deck out a full room so
[SPEAKER_01]: much as somebody like Terpy High.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay tuned to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go through the entire
building process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some people here and there can give
me some pointers and help me in the right
[SPEAKER_01]: direction, show me what I should do and
what I shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just follow along the journey and see
how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or grows, whatever you want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
