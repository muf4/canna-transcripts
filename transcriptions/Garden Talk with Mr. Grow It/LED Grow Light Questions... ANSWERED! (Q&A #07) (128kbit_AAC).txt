[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and I'm back with
[SPEAKER_00]: another Q&A video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to make this Q&A video more
topic focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular topic that we're going to
go over questions for is LED grow lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about doing other types of topics
in the future, whether it be questions in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to seedling stage, questions in
regards to plant training, questions in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to feeding, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have ideas for which one I
should tackle next, let me know down in
[SPEAKER_00]: the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into this video,
I'd like to give a quick shout out to our
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor, Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars Hydro currently has a 35% off summer
sale going on for certain items.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prices are already decreased on their
website, and you can stack my discount
[SPEAKER_00]: code on top of it to save more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their FC series of grow lights,
which are bar style, are one of the more
[SPEAKER_00]: popular lights, as well as their FCE
series, another bar style, but the bars
[SPEAKER_00]: are removable so you can actually
customize how the bars are placed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stock is limited, so when they sell out,
the sale will end.
[SPEAKER_00]: First to buy, first to save.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website and discount code are on the
bottom right hand corner of the screen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll also provide this information in
the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now let's get into the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much does power matter compared to
environment, nutrients, soil, genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: One could argue that it's the most
important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I personally think that genetics is
gonna be a baseline, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanna go after genetics first in
regards to what you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be a high yielding strain,
specific terpene profile, cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: profile, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from there, lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some could argue that nutrition,
environment are pretty equal there when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to what's gonna give you a high
yield, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have one, then it could
certainly impact the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, lighting is definitely one of
the most important things when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give your plant too much light,
it could do harm, such as light burn,
[SPEAKER_00]: slow down overall growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't give your plants enough
light, lower than optimal, then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just not gonna see the growth that you
would if it did have optimal light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely, that is a full spectrum
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you're talking about the Solar
Extreme 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that one is 400 watts, that's why I
mention it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had my hands on that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a unboxing video on it, then I did a
separate power test video on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, I definitely think you
would get better results running two in
[SPEAKER_00]: that growth space.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I took the power measurements,
I really felt like that particular light
[SPEAKER_00]: would be more suited for a two foot by
four foot growth space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think two of those in a four foot by
four foot growth space would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are people that reached out to
me before and told me that they do run it
[SPEAKER_00]: in a four by four and they get some great
results and I've seen videos of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it would be harmful if you
added in another light in that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next few questions are kind of similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you increase the intensity over its
different stages?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how high should you adjust the dimmer
on your light for each stage of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants life?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've gone over this a bunch of times in
a bunch of videos in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'll quickly just go over it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at PAR measured in PPFD,
200 to 400 PPFD is generally what I aim
[SPEAKER_00]: for for seedlings, clones, and mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 to 600 PPFD for plants in the
vegetation stage and 600 to 900 PPFD for
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're supplementing CO2,
you can go a bit higher than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have a PAR meter,
so you can't really dial in that distance
[SPEAKER_00]: by using a meter, most people what they'll
do is they'll look at the PAR chart that
[SPEAKER_00]: the grill light company releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually on the grow light listing,
or you can reach out to the manufacturer
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask them for a PAR chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use the PAR chart information
to help dial in that light distance,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're getting those specific PAR
ranges during the different stages of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it true that you achieve better results
in 75 to 85, unlike HPS at 65 to 75
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why it's generally
recommended to run a bit higher of a
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature when you're using LED grow
lights is because with HPS lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have IR that kind of radiates down,
and it increases the canopy temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: more than an LED grow light would.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's generally recommended
between 65 to actually 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard some people going up to 82 with
HPS, versus you hear a lot of people doing
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs up to 85, some even 87.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried 87 degrees in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cultivars can take it, others you
could see some stress happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days, I'm typically aiming for a
certain leaf surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you kind of get deep into it,
leaf surface temperature is the more
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate way to kind of measure what your
plant should be at.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit leaf surface
temperature is what I've had best luck on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I've read to be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen that certain cultivars are
able to take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go higher than that, 83, 84,
there are some cultivars that just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see the stress happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course, if you're lower than that,
you're potentially sacrificing growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually heard that same thing from
Dan from the Green Sunshine Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had recommended pointing a fan at the
heat sink to blow off some of that heat
[SPEAKER_00]: off the heat sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dan said that yes, the fixture should last
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should get a longer lifespan out of
that fixture if you're blowing off some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that heat off of the heat sinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, if the heat sink is
built for the amount of heat coming off of
[SPEAKER_00]: those diodes, you shouldn't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think it would hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, if you're doing that
right now, I don't think it would hurt to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know what level to set the
dimmer and the height during the different
[SPEAKER_00]: stages?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all LED grill lights are created
equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these fixtures have dimmers on
them now so you can dim them down,
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the amount of energy you're
consuming and also allows you to bring the
[SPEAKER_00]: light fixture closer to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're having height restrictions,
for example, it helps to dim things down
[SPEAKER_00]: and get the light closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every light is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's impossible for me to say,
OK, you're going to set it to 25 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: at this height distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when the plant grows to this stage,
you're going to increase it to this
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage on the dimmer and this light
distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's impossible for me to tell
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My recommendation is to look at the PAR
chart and you're going to have to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: monkey math or reach out to the
manufacturer and find out if there are
[SPEAKER_00]: certain dim levels that get you to a
certain amount of PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it's going to depend on which
plant you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different plants have different lighting
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is LED sidelighting worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did get my hands on some sidelighting
actually last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the chilled GrowCraft X1 and also I
got the chilled GrowCraft X1 mini.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't actually use it as sidelighting,
so I'm not really speaking from experience
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used it as a regular grow light actually
and it worked pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a debatable topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a lot of people are going to
say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people are going to say
that the lighting that you have over your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants is going to be enough for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of a situation where
it would be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you're in your grow room and the
grow light you're using doesn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: cover your entire plant or entire grow
space and you kind of have some
[SPEAKER_00]: sidelighting over there to compensate for
that miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, I really feel like
you're going to be fine with just a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular grow light and that you probably
wouldn't get much more out of it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: sidelighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about the Vivo Sun
VS1000?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Vivo Sun VS1000?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually used two of these in a two
foot by four foot grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any complaints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did look at the grow light listing
pretty recently and I feel like they
[SPEAKER_00]: overstate the coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally think that this light would
be best suited for a two foot by two foot
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space when we're talking about
flowering coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably three foot by three foot if
you're in the veg stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, two of those in a two foot by
four foot space would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of them in a two foot by two
foot grow tent would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think there are better
fixtures on the market today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually working on updating the best
LED grow light articles that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you are familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year I have an article that I update
which shows the best fixtures for
[SPEAKER_00]: different size grow spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular fixture did not make it on
the best LED grow light list for a two
[SPEAKER_00]: foot by two foot space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a heads up on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to check out that list of the
best LED grow lights, go to my website
[SPEAKER_00]: MrGrowIt.com, click on articles and then
it's under grow room and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would link it in the description section
however YouTube does not like my website
[SPEAKER_00]: so I don't post my website in the
description section.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about the Mars Hydro
SP3000?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen Rob said it was great for the
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that light is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a two foot by four foot grow space one
of those would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my hands on two of them in the past
and I put them in a four foot by four foot
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent and did some part measurements
there and it looks they looked really
[SPEAKER_00]: really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you space them out a little bit you can
get really even coverage across the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy there so that plus the components
that they're using are high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using Samsung diodes, Meanwell
driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I don't think you can go wrong with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is one of the more affordable
options on the market today and definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: worth it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on a budget this is a great
light for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why haven't you been using them all along?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started growing back in 2010 so 11
years and I really wasn't introduced LED
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights until like I think 2013 ish
and then back then a lot of them were just
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the LED grow lights created back
then were actually less efficient than HPS
[SPEAKER_00]: but they've come a long way for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually switched over to LED back in
2015 and I've been using it ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have anything against HPS,
MH, any HID grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing against them at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I personally use LED and I prefer
LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can light stress be a good thing in small
amounts?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much can you push it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't think that any light
stress is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had light stress on several plants in
the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean with these LED grow lights coming
out these days it's so easy to burn your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moment I start seeing any signs of
light stress I'll increase the distance of
[SPEAKER_00]: my grow light or I'll dim it down so it's
not as intense on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now speaking about my experience and my
observations I feel like it did negatively
[SPEAKER_00]: impact bud structure a little bit with
that additional light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally avoid light stress at all
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What temps should you run at different
stages?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some say leaf temp is lower than HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so we kind of touched on that in an
earlier question in regards to the HPS
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of increasing the the leaf temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But temp I usually aim for leaf temp 80 to
82 degrees throughout the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for for seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I'm not as worried about it when
the plant is seedling or young veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some would argue that it's safer to kind
of go on the lower side of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah 80 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit leaf
surface temp is what I usually aim for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are HPS equivalents BS?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think back in the day they might have
been used for but I personally don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: any need for them anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of manufacturer
particularly some of these grow lights you
[SPEAKER_00]: see on Amazon that they're exaggerating
what their HPS equivalents are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean there are some lights really that
pull a hundred watts from the wall and
[SPEAKER_00]: they say it's an equivalent of a thousand
watt HPS which is just I mean that's BS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when talking about HPS equivalents
seeing those mentioned on listings that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something I don't really pay attention to
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the life expectancy of LEDs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well not all LED grow lights are created
equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different diodes, different drivers are
going to impact the lifespan of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if you're talking about the
diodes in itself or if you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the fixture in a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: In most grow light listings you should see
a life expectancy number.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50,000 hours is what I see on a lot of
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah it's gonna be different depending
on which LED fixture you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are Spider Farmer and Mars Hydro the same
company?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the rumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard that in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't confirm it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with both of those companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider Farmer I have a different contact
than I do with Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wouldn't be surprised if there was a
parent company and then a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_00]: LED like brands underneath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that's pretty common across several
niches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple questions in regards to the
next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bars versus quantum boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thoughts on quantum boards versus new bar
style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are flat boards outdated?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think flat boards are outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of funny to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the flat quantum boards are
LED boards outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way the word quantum board is
trademarked by HLG, Horticultural Lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no other company should be using
quantum board.
[SPEAKER_00]: But LED boards what they're often referred
to flat board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that might be the first time I
heard of flat board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have a place here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the bar style beats the LED boards
or quantum boards hands down when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to light spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people what they look for is even
light spread across the footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the quantum boards the light is
really focused in the center of the
[SPEAKER_00]: footprint with a lot of grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has that dead center focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you look at the par chart
you'll see that the par numbers will drop
[SPEAKER_00]: off as it gets to the edges of the
footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the bar style light you're going to
get a much even footprint across the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one reason why I prefer those
bar styles versus the quantum boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I use both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the SF2000 LED grow light by Spider
Farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used the chilled GrowCraft X3 in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bar style light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah I wouldn't say that the LED
boards are outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that the bar style lights
definitely has the upper hand when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to light spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep absolutely have experienced light burn
in the past several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned earlier it's so easy to
burn your plants these days with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah light burn you know you start to
see it at the top of the plant works its
[SPEAKER_00]: way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually do have a full article on light
burn on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to MrGrowth.com click on
articles and then plant problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an article on light burn with a
lot more information about light burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah I've experienced it before and it
is no fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are BlurPro lights really that bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not cheap Amazon BlurPro LEDs but quality
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lighting scientists out there
that are going to argue that photons are
[SPEAKER_00]: photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say it's more about light
density the amount of light versus
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the BlurPro lights it had a
targeted spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of blue and a lot of red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Minimal green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's some UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a little bit of IR.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plant will still grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get people who are going
to say that full spectrum of light is the
[SPEAKER_00]: best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would personally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However I wouldn't rule out the BlurPro
lights as being something you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: grow with at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have it grow with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to get that density of photons or
that PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that at the right levels for the
different stages of growth like I talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should be able to get some good
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no I wouldn't say that all BlurPro
lights are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your choice of light for a 4x4?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally instead of buying a light
intended for a 4x4.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 4x4 flowering coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally prefer to run two lights in
that grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two separate lights in that grow space
with a flowering coverage area of two feet
[SPEAKER_00]: by four feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have two lights in that space
because you just have that flexibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally grow all different
cultivars from seed and as many of you may
[SPEAKER_00]: know each seed is it's own phenome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have different growth on
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get some plants that will stretch
up like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having the flexibility to raise one
light on one side of the footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping the other light down for the
smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally found that to be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it does sometimes help with
energy consumption as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had grow lights I've ran that didn't
have a dimmer on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm running the light full power 600
watts or whatever it may be for small
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having two separate lights in there and
even if I didn't have a dimmer on it I
[SPEAKER_00]: could at least cut the energy consumption
in half for seedlings for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah I really like to have two grow
lights in that grow space for flexibility
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened with your Maxi Sun
sponsorship?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually for those that don't know I
did a sponsorship with Maxi Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a video on my main channel where I
talk about the different fixtures that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also did individual park test
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the fixtures that they sent me on my
second YouTube channel which is this
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually took all of those videos down
and the reason why I did is because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: getting comments of people mentioning that
they've upgraded their fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they upgraded the components on the
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the information that was said with the
videos were no longer applicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only reason why I took down
those videos is just because the
[SPEAKER_00]: information is no longer correct in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to leave up those videos and
spread misinformation or outdated
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have anything against those
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those lights are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah that's what happened with that
sponsorship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it ever okay to have your plants closer
to the LED grow lights than the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer recommends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes but it's going to be very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the good grow light companies
they're going to give you a PAR chart to
[SPEAKER_00]: go by and those PAR charts are going to be
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case you can go by the
manufacturer's recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now unfortunately there are a lot of grow
light companies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly you'll find them on Amazon
where they only give you the dead center
[SPEAKER_00]: number for example of PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one measurement right in the dead
center of the footprint and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found instances where those
measurements were actually incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some grow light companies won't hesitate
to lie to you and exaggerate numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah if you have an LED grow light from
a company that isn't well known or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not showing all of their PAR
numbers on their PAR chart that might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: case where having the grow light closer
would be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part most these LED grow
light companies they're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate measurements for you that you can
go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got several people asking this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was the question that was actually
asked the most and I don't think I have
[SPEAKER_00]: the best answer for you but I'll try to
answer this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So way back in the day when I was using
HPS lights I was able to get away with
[SPEAKER_00]: just using the Foxfarm trio of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those that don't know Foxfarm has a
trio.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got it's a three bottle nutrient
line and I could use just those three
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles for the entire grow and my plants
would be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now particularly when I switched over to
LED grow lights I found that I was coming
[SPEAKER_00]: across calcium deficiency in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And talking with people you know back then
on forums people just said that you need
[SPEAKER_00]: CalMag supplement to be added whenever
using LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure if any science has come
out on this one or not but I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually know the true reason why that
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The true reason why you need to supplement
CalMag when using LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may just be because the density of
photons is greater or could have something
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we truly know why that is
the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's more of a question for a
lighting scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually looking to get a lighting
scientist onto my podcast in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Garden Talk with Mr. Grove podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's definitely a question I will
ask them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm worry, right now I aim for more lumens
for less watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just released an entire video
on this, what to look for when purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: an LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat down with Austin from Chilltech and
we talked about a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you can look for when buying
these LED grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: To sum things up, I personally look for
PAR first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that the grow light is
emitting enough PAR for that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I like to factor in efficiency,
light spread across the footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot more things that you can
look at when buying an LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the outro card of this video,
I actually link that video with Austin
[SPEAKER_00]: from Chilltech.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those of you who are new to LED grow
lights, you want to find out what to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for, what to look out for when it comes to
LED grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on that video to watch that
and learn more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed the questions that I
have for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good ones were asked here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate those of you who submitted in
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions that you want to see
in a future Q&A episode, leave it down in
[SPEAKER_00]: the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing to mention before I end
this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are new to growing, maybe on your
first or second grow, I did write a book
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is available on both my website and on
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to take you through the
entire growing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from gathering the equipment,
seeds, the different stages of growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do end up buying it on Amazon,
please leave a review on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my goal to get 500 reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so close to getting there actually
after I post this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have enough people to get over
there and leave enough reviews to get up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, the goal would be to
get a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are quite a ways away from that,
but I think I can get there eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed this video, please click
that thumbs up and I will leave it at
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
