[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: in to the Garden Talk podcast,
this episode number 117.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Dr. Alice
Adjustus.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a PhD in plant environmental
science from Clemson University.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is also a consultant owns the hemp
mine and created the CRC, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: science based research group.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has advanced knowledge in post harvest
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drying, curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what today's episode is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: She talks about some of the key
information when it comes to harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she also talks about some studies that
have been done in those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see highlights of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk clips

[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did a poll on my YouTube
channel where this podcast episode is
[SPEAKER_00]: posted to and 53% of the people that
responded weren't aware that have another
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it my main YouTube channel where I
show off the plants that I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That channel has over 130 videos from the
past seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not familiar with it,
I'll leave a link down in the YouTube

[SPEAKER_00]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Dr. Alyssa Justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met last year at a conference,
had a good conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually knew you before the
conference, very familiar with your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through the Utah State University,
the cultivation certificate program and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know you have a couple of talks in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was on post harvest
production, the harvesting, drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what I want to get into
today is you just have so much experience
[SPEAKER_00]: in regards to that and we've come so far
in the past five years alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing what we've uncovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that you're going to give us a
bunch of insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of my audience is going to
learn some things today that they haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: known because I feel like a lot of the
stuff still isn't widespread as much as it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get deep into things,
can you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I was born with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was born with green thumbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: My grandparents, my great grandparents,
their parents, everybody has been farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: for one thing or the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was basically born in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew trees, bare root, ball and burlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did petunias and pansies at one point,
a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of that, I swore I was never going
to go into plants when I was older,
[SPEAKER_02]: but here I am with a PhD in plant science.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's just one of those
things when you're little, you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to do what your parents do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved it and I got into it obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my PhD from Clemson University in
plant and environmental science.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, I didn't know exactly what I
wanted to do after graduation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did some consulting for a while with
pest management for greenhouses across the
[SPEAKER_02]: US and started getting some calls for
medicinal plant consulting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a few jobs and loved it,
packed my stuff up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a job first, but I packed my stuff
up and moved to San Diego and stayed out
[SPEAKER_02]: there for about three and a half years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working for a vertical group, which was
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to learn everything from seed to
sell, as they say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then decided I wanted to do my own thing
and have a little more freedom to research
[SPEAKER_02]: what I wanted and do what I wanted and not
be tied down by hitting a bottom line per
[SPEAKER_02]: se.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though that is of course still
important, but research and commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: production is certainly a different world
to live in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved back to South Carolina where we've
been growing under the hemp program since
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here I own the hemp mine, so that's a CBD
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do everything from breeding,
selling genetics, all the way to harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: and consumer goods and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really what's near and dear to my heart is
the research aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We created the CRC, the Cannabis Research
Coalition with Dr. Faust at Clemson
[SPEAKER_02]: University.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been running that for about three
years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a three-tiered program,
I guess you could call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is more of a membership model where
you give money and what you receive back
[SPEAKER_02]: in return is early access to research,
all the nitty-gritty that may not be
[SPEAKER_02]: published in a peer-reviewed paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: SOPs, access to talk to, hear and listen
from some of the nation's top growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: Glasshouse, Statehouse, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a place to get together and talk
about some of the problems you're having
[SPEAKER_02]: as far as growing goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also a contract research
organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody's having problems or if they
have a great product and they say,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've had as much internal R&D as
possible, we need somebody else to verify
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can trust your own research,
but if you're someone trying to buy a
[SPEAKER_02]: product, you don't necessarily only want
to listen to internal research.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're that third party, non-biased,
nothing tied to support bias, which I know
[SPEAKER_02]: later you want to talk about that in a
little greater detail, which I'm happy to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, of course, we do consulting and
audits and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you have so much going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, Clemson University,
Dr. James, a big name there in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: post-harvest production as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he had a talk at Utah State
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys go real, real deep into it and a
lot deeper than I think the average home
[SPEAKER_00]: grower goes into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to expose some of the
information here today, I think is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be really valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, we'll get into drying and then
curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For harvesting, talking about the ideal
time to harvest a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's mostly known that when the
trichomes are mostly cloudy, that's when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're at the highest potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some people like for it to turn
amber, where the inside cannabinoids go
[SPEAKER_00]: from THC to CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is all of that still true today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that still the ideal time to harvest a
plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: You said earlier that in the last five
years, we've come a long way, but the
[SPEAKER_02]: deeper in I get, the more I understand how
much I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you what's known today or at
least what's theorized today because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's more than what any of us in any of
our lifetimes are going to figure out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is certainly going to be something
that's done for hundreds of years and is
[SPEAKER_02]: why this industry is so exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were to study petunias or
poinsettias, there's hundreds of journals
[SPEAKER_02]: out there with great information already.
[SPEAKER_02]: With harvesting, I would say the most
important thing is to be delicate with the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a commercial setting,
a lot of times you're rushed in a hurry
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're just throwing plants around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you touch a trichome,
it will bust, for lack of a better word.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just being as delicate as possible,
having it touch as little things as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible will certainly keep your plant in
a lot better state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as when, what color the
trichome is, I have found by being a
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder and seeing lots of different
varieties, CBD, CBG, THC, seeing all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the varieties that are out there that
produce different cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've yet to find a true consistency of
being able to say 10% amber, perfect
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't happen the same way with every
variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I always suggest is if you have a new
variety, and a lot of this is costly,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this is perfect world scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a new variety and the breeder
says it's an eight-week plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The earlier you go, the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can graph it out and see how your THC,
CBD, whatever it is, can progress and
[SPEAKER_02]: where it peaks and where it starts to
decline.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can compare that to what it looks like
under the microscope and then you have
[SPEAKER_02]: that to repeat from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But testing is expensive and it's not
necessarily worth it for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would just say repetition and
growing a variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it's personal preference as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like mine to be on the earlier
side where they're more clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's some people that they
want it to be extremely amber.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of that's preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is simply theory, but I do not think
the amber comes from the THC to CBN
[SPEAKER_02]: conversion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it could be some sort of
non-enzymatic browning like other plants
[SPEAKER_02]: do when they ripen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bananas and apples, when you cut them,
there's some enzymatic browning happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's hopefully something I'll get
to dig into this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finding people to work with that can test
some of these more nitty-gritty aspects of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant has been pretty tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we finally got a university other than
Clemson that will test for carbohydrates
[SPEAKER_02]: and the pieces that can lead you down that
road of starch to sugar conversion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I truly think is the guts to what
is equating to a good cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes down to personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally like mostly cloudy with a
little bit of amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk to so many people who are just
like, oh, 10% amber, 20% amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, at the end of the day,
it comes down to personal preference,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you had said.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking at your trichomes and
you're counting them, it can be tricky
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes because are you looking at the
top ones where the light is directly
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting them or are you looking at an
inside piece or a lower bud?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because all that can be different
throughout the plant too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned the starch to sugar
conversion, which kind of relates to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next question I have here, which is in
regards to flushing the plants before
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there have been some studies that came
out in regards to flushing the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: before harvest, whether or not it's
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to many guests in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to bring this question up because
each person kind of has their own little
[SPEAKER_00]: tidbits on it, little insight on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to ask you this,
are there any benefits to flushing your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants before harvesting it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thus far, there's been a couple of studies
out about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the only true solid takeaway
we can have is that if you stop
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizing two weeks prior to harvest,
there's no differences in what's been
[SPEAKER_02]: tested so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that really is terpenes,
cannabinoids, yield with, I believe Mike's
[SPEAKER_02]: work, Mike from Clemson, his work was
showing that if you go further than two
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks of fertilizer restriction,
then you're going to start losing some
[SPEAKER_02]: yield, which makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right at that two week mark,
you're not losing yield and you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: losing any sort of potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that tells me is stop wasting your
fertilizer and you're not having any
[SPEAKER_02]: negative from doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, theory and again, something
that this year we're going to get done is
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at what else is happening during
that flushing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you flush, you see color
change, you see, depending on how hard and
[SPEAKER_02]: intense your flush is, you'll see faster
ripening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's my theory that that is in fact
what's happening is you're cutting off the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times you're lowering the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant is being pushed into
maturation faster than it would be if it
[SPEAKER_02]: were still getting all the nitrogen and
everything that would be encouraging it to
[SPEAKER_02]: stay, grow, I say vegetatively,
but I don't mean it being in this
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative form.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just mean in bulk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not pushing that nitrogen for
excess growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant thinks it's fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think, oh, no, it's time to close up
shop and protect these seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to ripen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would expect, I suspect that flushing
does help to push maturation that then
[SPEAKER_02]: changes those carbohydrates from being
starches to sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think there's some play in that as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The starch to sugar conversion in those
probably first five days or so of drying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it is still active.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's difficult to say when a
plant is dead because it depends on how,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it all depends on how much water
is in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, you know, is this thing alive
or not due to the water in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: due to the water supporting some of the
enzymatic activities that can happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would expect, you know, those last
few weeks of growing and then those first
[SPEAKER_02]: few weeks of first couple of weeks of
drying to really be when those changes are
[SPEAKER_02]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, it's been a couple of
year mission trying to get the right
[SPEAKER_02]: testing available for this plant
specifically to be able to check that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since that study came out by RX Green
Technologies back in 2020 in regards,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really showed no difference between the
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually made a video on it and I talked
about how the same view point as you is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, well, you can save money on
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why feed the plant up until the end if
it's not doing anything differently for
[SPEAKER_00]: you?
[SPEAKER_00]: The responses I got off of that was
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it seems like the biggest argument
is the starch to sugar conversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now we just don't have the data
to back that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting that that's the route
that you're trying to go to actively
[SPEAKER_00]: research and see if there is anything
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking forward to seeing what comes
out of there in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it should be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about giving the plants a period
of darkness before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing that folks do in
order to try to achieve a better result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are a varying number of reasons of
why people do it, but 24 hours of darkness
[SPEAKER_00]: before harvest, 48 hours of darkness
before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do even longer than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any benefit at all to giving your
plants a period of darkness before
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, again, it's been one of those
things I've kind of sat on the fence about
[SPEAKER_02]: could see the benefit of why.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I would lend it towards being
an act to encourage maturation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're digging deeper into trying
to understand what the outer structure of
[SPEAKER_02]: the trichome gland, how it's composed,
what it's made out of, and what really
[SPEAKER_02]: encourages it to crack or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that works with cantotrol.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I think there's something to
be found about its strength and with
[SPEAKER_02]: proper curing and harvesting, not
disturbing it, making it stronger and more
[SPEAKER_02]: encapsulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's always been interesting
when you go into drying rooms of large
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities, you know, you smell it a mile
down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's the day of harvest or,
you know, day after whatever, and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: smell it and you know, my thoughts always
will, if it's in my nose, it's not in the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's turps in the air,
and it's not like they're continuing to
[SPEAKER_02]: make these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, at some point,
it's going to be spent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we're able to preserve that
trichome head better, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: does that make your quality last longer?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that we're digging deep
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you know, learning the scanning
electron microscopy and really digging
[SPEAKER_02]: into that this past year and this year has
been an eye opener in understanding,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, how much we don't understand and
being able to see in detail that close
[SPEAKER_02]: because there are some drawbacks from it
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: As cool as the pictures look, it's also
not the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still so many people out there
that prefer the darkest before harvest and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're kind of blind in the fact of
whether or not it is beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that debate is going to be
ongoing from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any overall tips for harvesting or
anything we kind of need to know about
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting before we move on to drying and
curing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think for harvesting,
drying is delicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you've got to think of even if
it's 10 minutes where you've placed it in
[SPEAKER_02]: the sun, you know, if we're talking about
for a smokeable flower, 10 minutes in the
[SPEAKER_02]: sun, could do a ton of damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, being, being fast at making
your moves and, you know, being delicate
[SPEAKER_02]: and consistent with everything.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's move on to drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about the goal of drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really water activity is one of the things
that come to mind right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you talk to us about, you know,
what water activity is and kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall goal of it and so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, drying is the first thing
that comes to mind is, like you said,
[SPEAKER_02]: water activity for the point of not
spoiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're getting the water out just like
we would any other foods, raisins,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it may be, getting it down low
enough to where it does not support
[SPEAKER_02]: proliferation of microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now drying does not kill microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of spores and bacteria that
are super hardy and we can dry it down to
[SPEAKER_02]: a crisp and the spores are still going to
be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once it's rehydrated, they could take
over.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point is to get that water
activity low enough to not support other
[SPEAKER_02]: life growing on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really the difference between
water activity and moisture content.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're very related,
but the difference there is available
[SPEAKER_02]: water for microbes to persist in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal, correct me if I'm wrong,
is 0.6 water activity and that prohibits
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth of moles and yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is today's goal.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now are there any tools that growers can
purchase in order to measure water
[SPEAKER_00]: activity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moisture content meters are pretty
inexpensive, but they are also very
[SPEAKER_02]: damaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get a proper reading, you almost have
to take a full bud and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: squeeze it as tight as you can and then
stick the prongs in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, then you're ruining a bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not a great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing, which is, you know,
it's got a straw backs too, is a water
[SPEAKER_02]: activity meter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can be quite pricey.
[SPEAKER_02]: $1,000 own up, you know, $10,000 for a
really high end one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those aren't my preference either.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least in the home grower space,
you know, it's overkill.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I like to do is put your plants
in the drying room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring it down to where you think it's just
about right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you debug your flowers,
put it in a jar and then have a humidistat
[SPEAKER_02]: in the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you see the humidity level stabilize,
that is your water activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your humidity then turns into the water
activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you got to move the decimal two
points, but ultimately it's the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a jar, put a few buds in
there and it reads 70% humidity after it's
[SPEAKER_02]: leveled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there'll be a time of fluctuation
for the moisture to homogenize throughout.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you get to that homogenized
state, if it reads 70%, let's say,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're at a 0.7 water activity and
you might want to keep the lid open for a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of days or that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what a lot of home growers
are doing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really from what you're telling me,
it's not really worth it to go and spend
[SPEAKER_00]: money on a moisture meter, a water
activity meter for the average home
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, just putting the buds in the jar
and getting that humidity down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're safe at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for drying conditions, temperature,
humidity, what are the ideal dry
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the traditional 60-60 that
everybody's been using for forever,
[SPEAKER_02]: it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five points either way also works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think being able to go slower on the
days it takes to fully remove a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of water is beneficial for terpene
retention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the faster you're bringing that
water out, the faster you potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: could be volatilizing your terpenes off
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's a nice medium point
which 60-60, it achieves well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the time will come where we start
to understand again how delicate these
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes are.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that you get when you're using
very traditional systems, let's say a
[SPEAKER_02]: MiniSplit and a Dehu, when you're looking
at tracking over time, even though your
[SPEAKER_02]: set points might be 60-60, you've got
these pieces of equipment fighting each
[SPEAKER_02]: other all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the AC coming off on,
it's getting cooler, but then the humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: is also rising because the humidifier's
off, or the Dehu's off, and then it
[SPEAKER_02]: switches places because then the Dehu
kicks on, but then that makes the room
[SPEAKER_02]: hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just constant cycle of on and off
where you're also seeing these huge spikes
[SPEAKER_02]: up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I kind of like to think of it like
a balloon.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a balloon filled with helium
and you go outside and it's a humid day
[SPEAKER_02]: versus a not humid day, the balloon will
float and it will expand and contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I think of the trichome
head, is expanding and contracting because
[SPEAKER_02]: of this environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at some point, the expanding and
contracting will cause cracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these small cracks, how much terpenes,
how's the loss?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what I'm really interested
in is taking a step further than just
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing humidity and temperature and
understanding the pressure that goes
[SPEAKER_02]: behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because all of that is wrapped around VPD
and really understanding the internal
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure of what's in that cell and the
outside room pressure and not causing
[SPEAKER_02]: those swings to be so intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stability is kind of more important
than the temperature and humidity in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grand scheme of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I had mentioned going,
and a lot of these folks that are drying
[SPEAKER_00]: in tents, they're having just that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I have my humidifier kick on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans are going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I have exhaust fan come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm exchanging the air, but there's a lot
of swings happening, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be one or two degrees,
but those one to two degrees could be
[SPEAKER_00]: rupturing trichome heads, right?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, what would be the ideal length
of dry and number of days?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard anywhere from seven to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear five to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know the downsides of drying too
quickly versus trying too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you can get into that to begin
and then let us know what the ideal dry
[SPEAKER_00]: time days are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to share with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can squeeze into the talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a graph we put out where it looks at
days one to 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's looking at humidity and temperature
and correlates the VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it shows, you know, if you go out 14
days, it equates to this VPD and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it shows kind of right in the
middle there at seven days.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are at that 6060 mark, you should
be able to achieve it within seven days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really useful tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, obviously you can go
further than, let's say you're at 6060 and
[SPEAKER_02]: you go eight days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, each day you go past you're bringing
more and more water out of that flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you may think, OK, well, I can just
rehydrate it at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're starting to see a lot of extreme
rehydration can cause a lot of browning as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so being able to pull it right at the
right time and having to dry it a little
[SPEAKER_02]: more is OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're having to really,
really have to rehydrate it, you won't
[SPEAKER_02]: have quite as great results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the goal is to get it right where you
want it right when you pull it from
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever dry environment you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about a four day dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have the Canada Troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're familiar with the Canada
Troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one right back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using it for over a year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real consistent dries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands off as far as I'm not really messing
around with the equipment now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, humidifier and fan and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in their normal settings,
68 degrees Fahrenheit and a 54 dew point,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I believe is 61 percent RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a four day dry period and
then it transitions over to curing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the default settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is four days too quick of a dry?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't I don't think it's too
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, again, we're working through all
of these nitty gritty details with Canada
[SPEAKER_02]: Troll.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think anywhere between that four and ten
day mark is is OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, until we can say.
[SPEAKER_02]: You truly need five days at a water
activity of point eight to convert the
[SPEAKER_02]: starches to sugars, because that is what
makes for the better smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to say there's much difference
in in three days, as long as you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: drying it out too much, which I know their
product doesn't do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also know their product doesn't have the
extreme swings.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the traditional equipment does.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of, you know, what their
purpose is to have extremely consistent
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure, you know, VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, I don't I don't think it's too
short.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I don't I don't think we'll
be able to measure that until we kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: backtrack to what is what is a smooth
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quantify that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then backtrack from there to say,
all right, well, five days would allow
[SPEAKER_02]: this process to fully develop to equate to
the perfect smoke at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, sometimes I feel silly not
having answers, but as a researcher,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're told.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're told to be OK with not
having answers because that's your job is
[SPEAKER_02]: to find the answers, not guess the
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on the other side, you had mentioned
four to ten days.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of folks are trying for longer than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fourteen plus days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I heard from Dr. James Faust,
one of the talks that he had, he said the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing, same window.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it was four to ten days.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about some of the dangers of
trying longer than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get into that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens after ten days when you're
still drying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's certain danger if you're going
out longer than 10 or 14 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason that is, is because any
micro that you had in your crow,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're taking it with you into the drying
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the longer you have this bud sitting
wet, the more potential you have for
[SPEAKER_02]: botrytis growth and proliferation all
throughout the entire bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the most part, in traditional drying
sense, when you're drying out a large bud,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the outside of that bud that's drying
first and then the inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why when I say put the buds
in a jar and wait a day or so until it
[SPEAKER_02]: levels out is because all of that moisture
that's in the interior of the bud is then
[SPEAKER_02]: coming to the outside and it's equalizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're leaving the center of
that bud at 0.8 water activity or even
[SPEAKER_02]: higher, every minute is a second that
botrytis or a fusarium or whatever you
[SPEAKER_02]: might have could really take over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that I don't even risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually go around seven days,
sometimes 10 days at the max, but if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on long, longer than that,
I'm concerned and I'm actually checking
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the buds and looking for visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although that could be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be microscopic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more than just the naked eye,
you know, it could be there without us
[SPEAKER_00]: even seeing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've done a lot of work with Canada
troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've done a study with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually on their website,
Canada trolls.com slash research.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember correctly, real brief where
I think a lot of people looking for more
[SPEAKER_00]: details in regards to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you break us down what that study
entailed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was the Canada troll versus
the traditional 60 60 method.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, I think 16% higher terpene
content in the Canada troll drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, that was first stab at,
you know, really trying to understand,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, their unit and the flower it creates
and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, the first stab as well,
let's dry and cure at, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the two different methods, traditional
and, and the Canada troll system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's test what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem they had countered and
problems we've seen other companies
[SPEAKER_02]: encounter when testing terpenes is that if
you don't have your own internal lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: there can be a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so if you think about a dried
flower, it's got 2%, 4%, whatever it may
[SPEAKER_02]: be, um, by dry weight of terpenes,
which is a small number.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're looking at a hundred percent,
2% is very small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so if we're mailing samples,
even if you overnight it with ice,
[SPEAKER_02]: something's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so any of effect that could happen
during transit, or even if it's just being
[SPEAKER_02]: drove somewhere, anything within transit
is going to affect the terpene levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing to think about is,
you know, there's lots of great labs out
[SPEAKER_02]: there, but there's some that'll grab your
samples and maybe treatment one sits on
[SPEAKER_02]: the counter for an hour, maybe treatment
two doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so if we're looking at getting
true results on just 2%, um, that can
[SPEAKER_02]: cause a lot of problems, a lot of skewed
errors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the way we overcame that is that,
uh, we work with a lab, CAACHA,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I told them, you know, I want to do
the extraction at my lab and then I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to send you the liquid because the
solvents not going to lose terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be true to what exactly it
was the second I pull it from whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment is in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so that's what we send to the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so we can have very accurate
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course have duplicates to,
uh, to make sure there's no off problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how we did the terpene testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the only thing that made me
feel comfortable to do terpene testing
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's so tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, so getting results back from
seven days traditionally drying and seven
[SPEAKER_02]: days in the Canada troll, that's the
results we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the other thing that you got to be
super careful about and, and ask
[SPEAKER_02]: questions, um, when you're looking at any
study like this is, well, what was,
[SPEAKER_02]: what was the water content?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that can also skew the numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, if in the Canada troll,
it's a perfect 0.61 water activity and in
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional drying, uh, let's say it went
down to 0.58, you know, that might not
[SPEAKER_02]: seem like a lot, but in waterway that will
certainly, certainly skew the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we made sure we had all of those bases
covered to where we're truly just looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at, uh, the terpenes that the plant
produced, um, compared to what one to the
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the results we got was 13%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, across the board terpenes,
um, each, each individual terpene,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was some skewed, but overall that
certainly was the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is there a, like a white paper that
folks can reference and read more deeply
[SPEAKER_00]: into it as it was a peer reviewed or
anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to duplicate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so we had, we had reps within the
study, but we want to duplicate it again
[SPEAKER_02]: before the white paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to have a couple reps like that,
just cause you never know what could have
[SPEAKER_02]: went wrong along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is how you catch any problems
that you may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I mentioned and a handful
of videos now is that science is
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be able to take that and
repeat it over and over and over again in
[SPEAKER_00]: order for it to be fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: One study isn't just fact, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: One study could say anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have, there could have been
something that went wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it might, another study might
come out and it it's not repeated results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think you're doing your due
diligence, doing things right in regards
[SPEAKER_00]: to making sure that it can be replicated
and then, uh, and then going from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking forward to, to reading the
final paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was, it was great results.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did make a video on this actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, some viewers were concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mentioned that was a conflict of
interest a little bit since Canada troll
[SPEAKER_00]: paid for the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So could you kind of explain how that
works?
[SPEAKER_00]: So CRC, you mentioned that you are the
owner of the CRC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did the research for Canada troll
Canada troll pays money towards the CRC
[SPEAKER_00]: for the research to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand how some people can consider
that a conflict of interest, but like in
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry, how difficult it is to get
funding and the barriers you face in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to this, like there's no
government funding for you guys versus
[SPEAKER_00]: like other industries like food and
beverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much more government funding
and towards scientists and research and
[SPEAKER_00]: development and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of break that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was a little messy explanation
there, but can you kind of break down how
[SPEAKER_00]: that all works?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So funding is hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extremely hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, USDA likes to say that there
are hemp grants out there, but they are
[SPEAKER_02]: not, um, they're mainly for fiber and seed
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so if we're talking floral
research, um, there is nothing there as
[SPEAKER_02]: far as the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our choices are donations from anyone,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone can donate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that's, that's our, our,
our general donations is for our
[SPEAKER_02]: association.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so that's for research that is not
coming requested by a company.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just something that, you know,
the growers might say, ah, rude aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want X amount of our funding this year
to go towards you looking at rude aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aphid control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but then as I was saying earlier,
another tier is, um, third party
[SPEAKER_02]: validation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Canada troll says, Hey,
I want to do this study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we want you to perform it and give us
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say, that is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will perform the study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but in respect to their company,
I say, if, if you don't get the results
[SPEAKER_02]: you want, then I'm just going to keep my
mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we get the results you want,
you're, you know, I'll talk about the work
[SPEAKER_02]: we've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so there's no, there's no paying me
for certain results.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just respect of use of results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, you know, I would just want to
make it clear when they pay for it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not like I'm going out and buying a
new Volvo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Volvo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where that came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: New car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to buy a Volvo,
but, um, you know, this, this pays for all
[SPEAKER_02]: the our research, the tests testing is
extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it supports us in what we're
doing, you know, even though it is a
[SPEAKER_02]: project for them, the way I see it,
it's really a project for the industry to
[SPEAKER_02]: help, to help to understand what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if they were paying me to give
results, I would have probably went a
[SPEAKER_02]: little higher than, than 13%, but,
um, yeah, so it's, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I understand people say,
ah, so-and-so is sponsoring this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This test, but, um, I mean, all you can do
is trust me when I say we, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the results we give is what science gave
us and we're not falsifying anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just put it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been back in South Carolina six years
now, and for the first three years we've
[SPEAKER_02]: funded our own research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I felt like I've not gotten
anywhere cause it's been slower than,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if you had some huge government
grant, but you know, the stuff we sell on
[SPEAKER_02]: our consumer goods side, that supports
research, um, simply because I like doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it and I want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's, you know, there's
thousands of people out there that this
[SPEAKER_02]: will certainly help, not to mention the
patients who take advantage of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: science that's discovered, um,
and how that trickles down all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the C, CRC has been great
for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It brings in a little extra money,
um, and, and, and helps us get down to
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the problems we're having.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so can I say it's not funded by
someone?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's funded by someone, a bunch of
different growers, different companies,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I mean, all of our money personally or
not has to come from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, all I can do is show the viewers
and readers of research, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the, over the years of,
of the research we're giving and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, just keep giving good results and
helping farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you breaking that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are a lot of people out
there is just kind of ignorant of that
[SPEAKER_00]: fact of how the research is funded and,
you know, where the money comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was ignorant, uh, just a few months ago
until I actually sat down and did the
[SPEAKER_00]: research and try to figure out that,
Hey, the government isn't spending money
[SPEAKER_00]: towards this industry, like they are in
other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot harder for scientists to be
able to conduct research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's so slow, you know,
as far as doing the research and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: information out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, there's no money here coming
from the government that's really funding
[SPEAKER_00]: it like there are in other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you breaking that down for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no special research class that
we can get into, you know, have certain
[SPEAKER_02]: deductions or help with testing costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cannabinoids and terpenes,
one test is a hundred bucks and
[SPEAKER_02]: carbohydrate tests is $400 per test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's limiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we, we appreciate everyone that
can, can help us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't end the drying section until
we talk about freeze drying and a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more people are talking about freeze
drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is freeze drying and is it really the
future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I I've played with it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, um, in my opinion, I think for
bubble hash, I think for any sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrate extraction that it's great and
it's got a place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've seen some companies go out and
buy millions of dollars of equipment and
[SPEAKER_02]: freeze dryers just for outdoor smokeable
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you the ROI is not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, is it just to give you an idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a freeze dryer and it's just one of
the, you know, small two, but three maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that is $3,500 with the pump and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it'll hold what a pound and it
takes 24 to 48 hours to ruin the one
[SPEAKER_02]: pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can imagine, um, just a two
lighter, you know, how, how long and how
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive that process is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from a standpoint of ROI and making
your money back, I can't see how that
[SPEAKER_02]: could be feasible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, from a flower standpoint, it keeps it
the greenest I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's also very tricky to get the
set points just right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've done it and I've seen a lot of
people do it where you put it through the
[SPEAKER_02]: process and it's, you know, just,
it's just dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it, it, it keeps the plan exactly
how it is when you harvest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we are finding that certain things
like starch sugar conversions,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, other certain aspects like that,
that are important for that smoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're certainly not going to get it with
a freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because again, it, it pauses it in
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, any, any set starch that's there
will be there at the, at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: freeze drying cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could actually be a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's priced too high for me,
so I'm not going to be doing any time
[SPEAKER_00]: soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, yeah, for the average home
grower, I mean that, that price is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe in the future it'll come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there'll be competition,
more people releasing freeze drying
[SPEAKER_00]: machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as of right now, yeah, I think it's
kind of price a little bit too high and
[SPEAKER_00]: too lengthy of a process for the average
home grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on to curing, what is curing and
what happens during it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my eyes, curing is, is not just dry
and curing separated, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: very discrete separate times of treatment
to the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's really post-harvest handling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it all comes to go together with
looking at the changes that are happening,
[SPEAKER_02]: the carbohydrate status.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going from a very wet plant where
changes are fast to a more dry plant where
[SPEAKER_02]: the changes are slowing down because the
water's not there and available to let
[SPEAKER_02]: those enzymatic processes happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in my mind, it's, it's a,
it's a one fell swoop, um, in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: prepare the flower for use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, you know, people will say,
oh, it's for, um, for, for sweating,
[SPEAKER_02]: for, um, just very generalized answers,
making the flower better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, again, here I am in my
stance of that's my guess of carbohydrate
[SPEAKER_02]: change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but won't necessarily be able to
answer that a hundred percent confidence
[SPEAKER_02]: until next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say next year, uh, one 23, 25,
we get on this talk again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I'm hoping we have very
different, or actually I'm hoping we have
[SPEAKER_02]: the same answers, just with some data and
details behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we know that burping there is things
that are happening, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So burping, a lot of folks know about this
basic method to where after it's dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's putting into a jar or Turkey bag or
Grove bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're actually removing the lid of
the jar and off gassing has happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's been studies,
I think it was Dr. James Faust who is
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the studies done,
the off gassing, the CO2 levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: O2 levels, ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you able to talk about any of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ethylene is, you know, I don't think
it's looked at enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I understand why it's very tricky
to measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if you look at cuttings,
so poinsettia cuttings that are shipped
[SPEAKER_02]: from Guatemala to the U S for our
Christmas poinsettias, if you're thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about those pieces of plant, um,
fruits and vegetables, there's so much
[SPEAKER_02]: money and so many businesses that exist
just to control ethylene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because it is in short, a ripening
agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we have been able to measure ethylene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we know that ethylene, uh,
the amount that's produced is extreme in
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and drying, not as much as when
the plant has dried out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during curing really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we know the levels are extremely
high, but we don't know if that is a good
[SPEAKER_02]: thing or if it is a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because maybe we do want the plant to
ripen, which then is doing all of this
[SPEAKER_02]: conversions it needs to by having this
push of ethylene, or is it beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: actually to get down to a certain drying
point and then stop the ethylene
[SPEAKER_02]: production?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because you don't want it to go too
far.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, what are those metric points
along the graph that we need to know here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so Dr. Faust and I share an
ethylene sensor and it, uh, it's finicky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's finicky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a little bit of humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't zero it out properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It throws crazy numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like it's been a boot camp,
just learning how to use it properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that is, is going to be a goal this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we're doing a study with a company
that, that, uh, that makes post-harvest,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's just say, I can't announce who yet,
but curing containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they're very excited about the
thought of ethylene and what it could do
[SPEAKER_02]: or does, but again, it's just an
exploration experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, we're producing a product for
them to implement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so to be honest, this goes back to
our previous conversation is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the sponsorship money is simply
going towards exploration because we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know what the starting points are yet to,
to alter that one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, you know, experiment one is
putting flour in different types of
[SPEAKER_02]: containers and putting them together,
doing measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that gives you your baseline where
after that, you can say, all right,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, at day five, let's jack up the
ethylene content and, um, see what changes
[SPEAKER_02]: happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, ethylene, I believe is,
um, the very important gas we need to take
[SPEAKER_02]: an account, um, and, and start to figure
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully again, this is the year to
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but O2 and CO2 is also very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it's, I would encourage you
if you have a sensor and as a home grower,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially because if you're using a mini
split, um, you're recirculating that air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even though you're recirculating
that air and you're adding your CO2
[SPEAKER_02]: because your plants are taking the CO2
away, what does that mean about your
[SPEAKER_02]: ethylene?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you also just compounding your
ethylene?
[SPEAKER_02]: Content since you're not actually bringing
in, uh, fresh sourced air.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking with a grower, uh,
it was probably within the past year and
[SPEAKER_02]: he has a, a dry room that went out of
commission.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had to use an old dry, an old
growing room to dry in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because it was a growing room,
he had a CO2 sensor in there and the
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers that the plants drying or
producing, which he would never would have
[SPEAKER_02]: looked at the CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it had not been him drying in the grow
room, which measures it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the numbers were like well past
what's safe for a human to go in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so, you know, again, I don't know
what that, what does that equate to
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but when you have levels of
anything out of whack, so extreme,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to understand and be able to
apply, apply optimization behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's wild being in an industry
that we're still on many things,
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction, you know, especially on the
patient side, patients, understanding all
[SPEAKER_02]: the different cannabinoids, everything as
exploration right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, it's exciting, but it's
frustrating having to repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know so many times, but none of
us do.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still a lot to learn, still a lot to
uncover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the reasons why I like to be
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I said in my videos many times
in the past is doing the same thing over
[SPEAKER_00]: and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that gets boring to me,
being able to learn new things that cover
[SPEAKER_00]: new things, try new ways to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes a job more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, looking forward to seeing what
gets uncovered there in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with so many different ways to cure or
store jars, turkey bags, Grove bags,
[SPEAKER_00]: what have you found to be the best method?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then are there any of those methods
that you would say, are good to do and you
[SPEAKER_00]: should avoid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it always comes back to
there's a, there's a million ways to skin
[SPEAKER_02]: a cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and a lot of my work is, is really
working with the large scale growers who,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, is looking at every penny spent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so for example sake, even though
stainless steel is great and it's easily
[SPEAKER_02]: cleanable and it doesn't break like glass
and it does a good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, would it be possible for a
commercial grower to go out and buy all
[SPEAKER_02]: stainless steel containers for thousands
of pounds?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, probably not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, a lot of my time and work is
spent looking at those limitations of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of really commercializing on a large scale
and making the best call based from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now if I'm at home and I'm growing my
own and I'm putting it in my own,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, resource that's available there
for me and there's no limitations,
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably would use glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably would use glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would use glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my short personal answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that's not always the answer for
large production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you hear through the grapevine of
people being concerned about
[SPEAKER_00]: microplastics, you know, so the turkey
bags, Grove bags, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what I'm understanding,
there's no really research to back that
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just kind of a theory at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be interesting to see if anything
gets uncovered there, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that would be terrible if
microplastics were leaking in there and we
[SPEAKER_02]: were consuming them and always something
to worry about.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ask you one more question in
regards to storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So storage temperature, a lot of people
store and you know, 60 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: roughly say the higher the temperature,
the more terrapins are going to volatize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to lose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lower the temperature goes down,
I'm being told it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are storing in a wine
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 50, 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my preferred ways to store
some people in refrigerators, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: just about freezing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically put 33 to maybe 44 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any concerns in storing in a wine fridge
or a refrigerator?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that's the best, the best
move.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just be very certain that the
container seals properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whatever container you're in,
this is sealed because even in a
[SPEAKER_02]: refrigerator, even though it would be
slower, it still can dry out if it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: mained properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting your drying down, you're curing
and then holding at the exact water
[SPEAKER_02]: activity you want in the lower
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, the lower you can go,
the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know some people, they don't
necessarily have a full wine fridge just
[SPEAKER_02]: for their curing, which would be pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was using the wine fridge before
the Canada Troll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I live in Las Vegas and it's
very hot here and natural room
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lucky to get 70 degrees Fahrenheit
room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally it's 75, sometimes 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to just store it in those
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within three months, browning
happening, like those higher temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: really degrade the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I switched over to storing in the
wine fridge, and yes, I have them in
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also did in the Grove bags, made sure
the humidity was locked in at 60 to 62%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But putting it in that lower temperature,
conserved them for a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't have any browning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have it for a year and there's no
browning happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I was a big proponent of the wine
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be clear on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are trying drying in a wine
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada Troll, now it's just for drying and
curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the biggest benefits of
Canada Troll is the drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think, oh, I'll just buy a
wine fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, go ahead and try to dry in a wine
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get a good result
unless you do some sort of alteration to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, yeah, I am a proponent of the
wine fridge for storage in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just wanted to kind of pick your brain
a little bit on storing at 60 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: versus in a refrigerator at 40 degrees,
if there's any big difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think like you said, it's just the
length of shelf stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: The colder you keep it, the slower any of
those degradation processes are and the
[SPEAKER_02]: longer it lasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think it all just matters of
how peak you are with perfection and
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting to keep it as green and really
longevity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know you're going to smoke it all
in a month, then maybe it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily required to have your own
fridge for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll do just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a temperature control room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the cooler, I would say the
longer is really the takeaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couple more questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them in regards to any studies that
have been done recently in the past year
[SPEAKER_00]: or two that have revealed some valuable
information that you feel like would be
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable to the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple studies out of UGA that
have, I don't know if they've been
[SPEAKER_02]: published.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was a post-harvest study and she
was looking at terpenes and hemp at
[SPEAKER_02]: different curings.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, going back to this,
it's all exploration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hers was very dirty with the barn hanging.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 60-60 method was the best
representation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she was looking at some of the
techniques she would do with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fire curing and those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been some studies and some nice
generalizations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to conclude from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're looking for extremely high
quality, smokable flour, at least I
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't seen it in the past couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because again, a lot of it has been on
hemp with really the thought being outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp that you're drawing fast for isolate
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: One exciting thing we've begun and about
to start phase one on, which we could
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly use your help on getting the
word out on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you familiar with Miyabi Shields and
Riley?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're both PhDs in basically plant
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both have a little bit different
specialty in each.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they now run the nonprofit NAP,
the Network of Applied Pharmacognosy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've been friends for a while and
been trying to find a way to work
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've now figured it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to do a large project that's
called the science of smokability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because basically everything from flushing
to the joint being in your hands is what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really trying to put understanding
around what represents a smooth smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it about the color of ash that
matters?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been people say that certain
smokes can make their tongue tingly and go
[SPEAKER_02]: numb, which I've never experienced that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was going to be a little harder to
dig into.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of these generalities that
everybody expects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want my ash white.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it to be smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want it cured for five months.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really want to look at, again,
the end point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So consumer preference and back it up to
be able to say what's doing what.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a lot to cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're breaking it into phases.
[SPEAKER_02]: With phase one, it's going to be pretty
easy, pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all ground to the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Micron size.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all packed to the same density.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is all the same water content.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same water content.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got different water contents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we said, all right, well,
that'll be the easiest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's simply looking at water content.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some with a 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got a high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a low.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got what everybody says is just
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very easy to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get joints at three different contents
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send those out to the public, people
that's interested in the study,
[SPEAKER_02]: and have it double blinded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the people say, all right,
well, this smells the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: This tastes the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: This smokes the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get super nitty gritty into the
patient discovery, which, thankfully,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got experience on, because I'm
usually just with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're really good at connecting the
plant and the treatments with the person
[SPEAKER_02]: and how to gather data from a person.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not something I have specialty in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where we kind of all come
together as a nice group, ranging from
[SPEAKER_02]: growing all the way to smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So phase one, water content.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have CBD joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be mailing them out and getting
test results back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the past two years, I've dug so
hard into tobacco research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you think about cigarettes,
if you're a smoker and you go to one state
[SPEAKER_02]: versus the other, or if it's two years
difference, you're going to expect that
[SPEAKER_02]: cigarette to be exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to be mad if it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's repetition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot that's going in to get
that cigarette exact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know when good ones are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's growers that can produce good
ones consistently.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how do you convert that to be able to
show other growers this is what's good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Until you have data behind that,
you can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is our goal is first start with
water content.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll go on to other things like
certain elements that can accumulate that
[SPEAKER_02]: causes a bad smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's certain elements that can
accumulate that can cause a bad smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's certain elements that can
accumulate that that will cause the ash to
[SPEAKER_02]: break off faster than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So phase two will be elements because in
tobacco, they go deep into even the
[SPEAKER_02]: government restricting certain
applications of certain fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_02]: excess because it will mess with the
smoking process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow both of them on social media and
they're always coming out with interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
