[SPEAKER_07]: To discuss unlocking the medical benefits
of cannabis, we have an all-star panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to lead us in moderating that panel,
a biochemist researcher at the National
[SPEAKER_07]: Institute of Biology in Ljubljana,
please welcome Professor Dr. Tamara
[SPEAKER_07]: Latyrnczyk.
[SPEAKER_06]: A panel on medical use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have heard now how it's produced.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for this reason, I would like to
invite my dear colleague, which is one,
[SPEAKER_06]: David Neubauer, Professor Neubauer,
who is a pediatrician and neurologist,
[SPEAKER_06]: child neurologist, and has been leading
the pediatric department of, neurology
[SPEAKER_06]: department of the pediatric.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the past.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the second one is the famous
pharmacist, this is Professor Boris
[SPEAKER_06]: Strukel, who is internationally recognized
and very busy in different businesses and
[SPEAKER_06]: pharma industry and consultant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he is a professor at the Faculty of
Pharmacy of University of Ljubljana,
[SPEAKER_06]: leading the department of pharmaceutical
biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_06]: So please let me sit down.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the introduction, I would like to say
just a few words about medicine,
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis in medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we know that it has been used in
medicine for thousands of years,
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands of years in many old,
but civilized cultures and actually
[SPEAKER_06]: started all in China about 500 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the really renaissance of modern
cannabis medical sciences was done in
[SPEAKER_06]: Israel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the leading scientist was Rafael
Meschulam, which you maybe know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he initiated and of course then
motivated several scientists all around
[SPEAKER_06]: the world to researching the properties of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: He discovered endocannabinoid system and
the use of medical cannabis by using
[SPEAKER_06]: clearly state-of-the-art biomedical,
biochemical, physical methods to prove
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course also bioinformatic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And based on such a solid foundation,
there is still a problem how to translate
[SPEAKER_06]: this knowledge to clinics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here, we have problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we have problems as we already heard
a little bit around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these were the problems that are
related to the medical agencies and
[SPEAKER_06]: administrative obstacles in many
countries, also in Slovenia, especially in
[SPEAKER_06]: Slovenia, I must say, and unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also there is a problem with medical
society, medical staff, medical doctors to
[SPEAKER_06]: accepting, to even understand,
try to understand the benefits of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, although the science is really
showing that it has an effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we will hear about that today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So talking about the history, I would like
to ask first, of course, this was used for
[SPEAKER_06]: various diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will ask you first, David,
which diseases have been discovered first
[SPEAKER_06]: to benefit from the consumption of
cannabis products in the history and
[SPEAKER_06]: nowadays?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Tamara.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in the history, it is well known
that already the especially Arabic
[SPEAKER_05]: Mohammedan doctors were using cannabis for
different purposes, but especially for the
[SPEAKER_05]: seizures, because at that time,
for epilepsy, there was no other
[SPEAKER_05]: medication.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the end of 19th century or in the
beginning of the 20th century,
[SPEAKER_05]: the first medications were bromides and
soon after that phenobarbitone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was actually a kind of help for
these patients with the severe epilepsy
[SPEAKER_05]: problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, already at the end of 20th
century, there were just few reports about
[SPEAKER_05]: possibility to use cannabis for the severe
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Patients for those with very resistant
epilepsies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that time, maybe we already had
pharmaceutical 30 or even 35 drugs,
[SPEAKER_05]: which were quite effective, but still one
third of the patients will remain
[SPEAKER_05]: resistant to all this treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think pediatric epilepsy was the
first one to merge from this medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was in 19, no, in 2014,
actually, that the mother of young
[SPEAKER_05]: Charlotte, who had severe early epileptic
syndrome, which is called Dravet syndrome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she had for 200 or 300 seizures per
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she went to Stanley Brothers in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she asked them if they can produce a
kind of oil from the cannabis for her
[SPEAKER_05]: daughter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was actually a miracle because
within 10 days of this treatment,
[SPEAKER_05]: the girl has become nearly seizure free.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of 200 seizures per day,
she had only four or five per week.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thereafter, it came to the public.
[SPEAKER_05]: In some newspapers and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from that time on, the research on
cannabinoid treatment for severe resistant
[SPEAKER_05]: epilepsy started.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have used Cannabidiol from 2015 on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is for the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And already at these early years,
three years after that, we have published
[SPEAKER_05]: a paper with retrospective study.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were astonished when we analyzed
the data.
[SPEAKER_05]: One fifth of our children was completely
seizure free.
[SPEAKER_05]: So 20% were seizure free.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one half of the patients, they had
only occasional seizures so it was a
[SPEAKER_05]: remarkable result.
[SPEAKER_05]: And soon after that, also the other
studies confirmed that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially for the families or mothers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And especially then for the children that
can grow, learn, and get into a society.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I want to ask you also if this is
first disease that was FDA approved also,
[SPEAKER_06]: or were there others?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the majority of the studies,
maybe I can just show some comparisons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is one systematic review.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that the majority of these
studies, this is our study and there are
[SPEAKER_05]: also many others.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that the results are rather
similar in all these studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And epilepsy is the one which is the most
studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, in Brazil and in Israel,
and also in some states in America,
[SPEAKER_05]: they were using also for the other
conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially for the spasticity,
for behavioral problems in autism,
[SPEAKER_05]: for severe sleepiness problems,
and for pain, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pain is also one of the topics which is
studied.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is still used now all over the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: But not only for children.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then for adults, the epilepsy is not
treated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm talking about our country in
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, the neurologists for adult
persons, they are very rarely using
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if it has been proven, also in the
double blind studies, that it is very
[SPEAKER_05]: effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also these nice guidelines are giving
these recommendations that it should be
[SPEAKER_05]: used as an add-on drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not as a primary antidebate, but an add-on
drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are not using it.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, do you want to?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there is only one thing more.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the summary of these studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I would like to say also is that
there was one study in Dunn which showed
[SPEAKER_05]: the comparison between purified
cannabidiol, which we are using,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the extract of cannabis, which they
are calling it cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Enriched cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But however, there is THC also inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you can see, this is our study.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are the other study.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you use cannabis enriched
preparations, the results are even better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is, to some extent, it is normal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because then you have this entourage
effect and all this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we are coming to that later on in
the discussion with pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now I would move to Borut.
[SPEAKER_06]: And first I would like to say that first
after China, then also this knowledge was
[SPEAKER_06]: transferred to the East, practically,
to India, to Syria, to Persia,
[SPEAKER_06]: to Greece, to Egypt.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it came also to Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, first it came from India by the
medical doctor and chemist, William
[SPEAKER_06]: O'Shaughnery.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was also working in India for a
long time, transferred this knowledge to
[SPEAKER_06]: England.
[SPEAKER_06]: And soon after that, it was already in
English, pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also in American pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even in Yugoslav pharmacopeia,
as I learned today, for several,
[SPEAKER_06]: several years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Until, of course, we all know that a
prohibition came 100 years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And since then, of course, and now
recently, it's again in European
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what does it mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Slovenia will also accept European
pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_06]: How would this change the attitude to
prescribe cannabis, to use cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: and especially among the doctors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I would like to thank two
organizers for giving me the opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tamara, excellent moderator,
as usual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the same faces, the same audience,
second or third year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is new?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, unfortunately, not that many.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to emphasize that I'm going to
talk as a pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to advocate some kind of
pharmaceutical legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, I would like to put
a very big black spot on this regulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly in Slovenia, in order to move
forward with what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to know that scientific
evidence are something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But clinical studies, approved clinical
studies, recognized by FDA or EMA in
[SPEAKER_01]: European Union, it is something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevertheless, we'll come to this later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, finally, we are faced with the
European pharmacopeia monograph on the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was issued on July 1, 2024,
so very new document.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, we have this document.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That all medical cannabis that is going to
be produced in Slovenia or imported from
[SPEAKER_01]: any other countries have to fulfill,
completely fulfill, with the criteria
[SPEAKER_01]: which is in this monograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me tell you a very recent example.
[SPEAKER_01]: One pharmaceutical company, wholesaler,
distributor, asked this company,
[SPEAKER_01]: apply for the permission for import of
cannabis, which cannabis, medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, from Bedrocon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You all know that this is the golden
standard European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the monograph was prepared according
to the characteristics of this plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very well standardized with the
content of 22% of THC and other
[SPEAKER_01]: components.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was the answer from agency?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a negative one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because do not I mean, the certificate of
analysis from the company that produced
[SPEAKER_01]: this Bedrocon, there is a slight
modification in the ash, residual ash and
[SPEAKER_01]: arsenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, we're talking about 0005
instead of something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So extremely rigid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the take home message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many times I emphasize this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is a will, there is a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a will from the regulator point
of view, we're gonna get the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so coming back, yes, this is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now monographs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all importers, all producers,
by the way, about the production,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was excellently presented by my
colleagues from, Andrea from Hope
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we are very close to the standardized
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, all producers in terms of medical
cannabis have to fully fulfill good
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture and collection practice,
which is the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's impossible to raise the plant
somewhere in not controlled conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that it is important to
know that we just passed with the
[SPEAKER_01]: referendum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very clumsy one, but never mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the outcome is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something is important to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to distinguish, sorry,
this is not real question, but just to
[SPEAKER_01]: mention, we have to distinguish between
medical use and recreation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am for both.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we have to separate these because
of the conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we would like to have a raw material
for the final product in terms of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, we have to raise the plants
according to good agriculture and
[SPEAKER_01]: collection practice, which is not the case
of the recreation one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So coming back, okay, we have this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of this, medical agency for,
I mean, sorry, agency for medical products
[SPEAKER_01]: and medical devices, ask importers,
yeah, or any kind of, I mean, any
[SPEAKER_01]: individual to provide a special forum,
which is called the written request for
[SPEAKER_01]: the needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was explained to us that there are
no need to produce or to export,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was also mentioned by Andrea,
that actually the needs are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the plants are already available
at Oncological Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go furthermore, because I'm quite
upset on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the document that agency is used
for?
[SPEAKER_01]: One single document, it is called
recommendation for palliative care for
[SPEAKER_01]: oncological patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you imagine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Recommendation, this is the bottom level
in hierarchy of the documentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not care about any kind of
international guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have quite a lot of guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this recommendation, there are only
two indications.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, it is pain, but the cannabis is
supposed to be the second line medication,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the first one, in this document.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second, it is prevent vomiting,
prevent no nausea, which again means only
[SPEAKER_01]: two single indication for the oncologic
patient that are on the palliative care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, it is a dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say, if there is no will,
there will be no kind of, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about other diseases?
[SPEAKER_01]: Neurological disease, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I will stop it here and let me put
you later on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, because I have many questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: One is also for you about the role of
pharmacists, not only suggesting or
[SPEAKER_06]: helping patients that are coming to the
pharmacy and ask for help, but even more
[SPEAKER_06]: so, what is the role of pharma industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they somehow, of course, it's a
competition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they opposed against, or can they
perhaps involve cannabis production of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis pharma in their lines,
or is that, what is the situation in the
[SPEAKER_06]: market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, you know, excellent question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Tamara.
[SPEAKER_01]: From silica industry, it is not a Caritas
or Red Cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is always profit behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from silica, it is not opposed
preparations coming from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the regulation, it is extremely
strict, which means that the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical industry has to perform
clinical studies that are extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the whole indications are technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is protected by patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, Epidiolex, which is a
composition of CBD, THC, predominantly
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, 10 to one or 15 to one, something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have Sativax.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a finished product composed of THC,
CBD, one to one, two, five, five
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But due to the very strict regulation and
patent protection, it is very difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: penetrate this as a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmaceutical industry, it is for a
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me implement this to Ozempic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You all know that this is GLP-1 agonist,
which is actually the only indication it
[SPEAKER_01]: is treatment for diabetes patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But due to the fact that very pleasant
side effect was found out that this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction of the weight, all of us,
we are seeking for this Ozempic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is off label use, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pharmaceutical industry, under the
table, produce a lot, a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of this kind of cannabis,
because of the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, officially, they could say,
no, the only indication is this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not against.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, on the other hand, is this a
real profit if several factories are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to produce medication with only two
indications, which are actually the second
[SPEAKER_01]: line products for 3D syndication.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what does this mean for the patients?
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, this is unethical to the
patients, because they are at a decline of
[SPEAKER_06]: any treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they go to black market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you have good experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe this case, please explain us
what happened when suddenly the import of
[SPEAKER_06]: Epidolics was blocked.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have started a group of children where
parents came to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were asking us if we can analyze
these products which they bought at the
[SPEAKER_05]: black market for children.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did the analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what we have found.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I finished before with the slide where
I showed that cannabis enriched
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabidiol is much more potent than
cannabidiol alone, like pure cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_05]: or isolated cannabidiol, somebody would
say.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the slide showing how different
were THC and CBD contents in these
[SPEAKER_05]: specimens.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that even the ratio sometimes
was 1 to 100.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that the children were giving
pure THC on one hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the other hand, there were products
with very high content of CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was no THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these were the products that the
parents were buying?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The parents were buying this at black
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: We never asked them where did they get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, our institute, Josef Stefan,
did this analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what came out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And together with this, very different
concentrations of THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of them, they are quite
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you know that when you have CBD
together with THC, the CBD is
[SPEAKER_05]: counter-effect of THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there will be not so much side effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other thing was that there were a
lot of heavy metals and even steroids in
[SPEAKER_05]: these samples.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these data, unfortunately, were not
published because the paper was not
[SPEAKER_05]: accepted.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think this is a very important
message.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it will be so they can see how
unethical it is to expose children or
[SPEAKER_06]: patients to the black market.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will now clear something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we were talking, and maybe the
audience is not really acknowledging this,
[SPEAKER_06]: that we talk about medical cannabis,
which is the full spectrum, as you said,
[SPEAKER_06]: the broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: The full spectrum is the differences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the pure cannabinoids, isolated and
mixed together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is the difference?
[SPEAKER_06]: As I understand this mixture, medicinal
cannabis is hard to make this kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: therapeutics, a randomized clinical
trials, as is asked by the doctors,
[SPEAKER_06]: medical doctors, for the drugs to be sold.
[SPEAKER_06]: So can you explain what is the difference?
[SPEAKER_06]: We call this entourage effects of
different cannabinoids, different
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in this mixture extract of the
flower, medical flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is the difference and how to open
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you for this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, yes, you are completely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that while the full spectrum
composition of the cannabinoid extract,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is composed not only on cannabinoids or
terpenoids or any other kind of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allow me to compare this with a very
well-known remedy, which is it is cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like medicine now, but it was known for
the centuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is extract of Valerian of its
analysis, Valerian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, at the Pharmacy University of
Ljubljana, we performed some studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not only we all around the globe,
scientists tried to isolate particular
[SPEAKER_01]: substances like ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that for pharmaceutical industry,
it is much easier to deal with one
[SPEAKER_01]: component.
[SPEAKER_01]: One compound, one molecule due to the
analysis, control of analysis,
[SPEAKER_01]: standardization, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so it was found out that what we
analyzed, so there were valerianic acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: essential oils, valepotreats, flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we test not only we, but this was the
consortium, exactly, all around the globe,
[SPEAKER_01]: the effect, what is the effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the supposed to be effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sedative effect, let's say, some kind,
yes, as a sedative, as an anti,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, exeritic and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how valerian is work.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so we found out that not more than up
to 5% of this effect were exposed by a
[SPEAKER_01]: single component, separated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Separated from the mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means that the mixture really works
pharmacologically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Psychologically synergistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly the same it is with the
cannabis extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we have to be very precise on
which kind of indication we are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, I mean, in generally,
I am in favor to have a full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what does this mean,
full spectrum?
[SPEAKER_01]: This depends on the mode of extraction,
mode of application, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the growing condition of the plant,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the difference between full and
broad spectrum?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we call it full spectrum if there is
THC inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And broad spectrum if there are only
non-psychoactive cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the THC content is the difference
between full and broad.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, when I stay with you now and go to the
future, from the past to the future,
[SPEAKER_06]: what is the future of using cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or medicinal cannabis in neuroscience,
in neurological diseases?
[SPEAKER_05]: As we have been astonished by cannabidiol
use and effectiveness using it in the
[SPEAKER_05]: resistant, very resistant childhood
epilepsy, we have been even more
[SPEAKER_05]: astonished using it also as in the case of
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, it came from the parents.
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually came to us and they asked
them, why would not try cannabis product?
[SPEAKER_05]: That means full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means cannabidiol plus THC in severe
behavior conditions of autistic children.
[SPEAKER_05]: These were children who were having a lot
of different antipsychotic drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are also off-label, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not meant to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Risperdal, for example, and quetiapine,
and so on, so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the parents were coming and they said,
each drug of these antipsychotics we used,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why we will not try this product?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we said, OK, we have a product
which is CB, CBD, THC, 10 to 1.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means 10 times the content of CBD
is higher than THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let us try this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was remarkable, really,
because these behavioral problems of
[SPEAKER_05]: autistic children, which can be very,
very serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have here a video.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it will go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You will not hear the voice because the
voice is awful.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this boy, he had this temper tantrum
after seeing through the window that their
[SPEAKER_05]: neighbor parked the car not on the usual
place, but a place beside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he got this temper tantrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is typical.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was so upset.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, he was completely upset.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is actually typical for these
severe autistic children.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes they are also hurting
themselves, or even the family members,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is really.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the results were remarkable.
[SPEAKER_05]: But not only in our small study,
there were only 17 children.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are this year's studies which
proved actually the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Masa, the Brazilian authors,
and Miller-Wall, the doctor from Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: She did a lot of study on Tourette
syndrome and tick and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is our own study.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the first randomized
double-blind placebo-controlled clinical
[SPEAKER_05]: trial on 60 children with these severe
autistic problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they all showed, including ours,
that these behavioral problems,
[SPEAKER_05]: these severe behavioral problems,
can be really overcome by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end, I will just say that one
of our families, the boy is now 17 years
[SPEAKER_05]: old.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said after so many, many years of
trying different antipsychotic drugs,
[SPEAKER_05]: we have now a time when we can sit outside
together and have a coffee in peace.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are really very happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because sometimes you need just a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for these parents, that means a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the quality of, completely changed
quality of life.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can go outside and they can sit
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you predict that this will be taken to
the child?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes, yes, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: His life.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really an experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's astonishing that also you
found this out, as many others.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will be probably also going to be
approved by FDA or our agency.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our agency, what do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Would our agency, based on this data,
approve such a treatment?
[SPEAKER_06]: So tell us something about the
suggestions.
[SPEAKER_06]: How to deal with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do believe, really, I do believe
that we're in front of something which is
[SPEAKER_01]: called a final goal, final goal of all of
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is that the patient will be able
to get the prescription to go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacy and to get this or that product
based on the flowers of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe that at the agency that now
they have all documentation which is
[SPEAKER_01]: needed for production or for, let's say,
for importation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is stupid to ask about the number
of patients that need this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there is estimation,
for example, from National Institute of
[SPEAKER_01]: Public Health.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is estimation that 12,000 only cancer
patients are regularly use medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and the answer from agency was there
is no need.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is needed, it is on the Oncological
Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is the combination,
this is the comparison that only cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: patients are eligible to get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the final goal will be to come to the
pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, well, not why pharmacy,
not because I'm pharmacist, but everything
[SPEAKER_01]: should be regulated in the whole
production chain from the beginning to the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me implement something that I,
many times I try to give this example and
[SPEAKER_01]: please try to understand me correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you get a bacterial lung
infection, what will be your first step to
[SPEAKER_01]: go to doctor and then to get a
prescription with what antibiotic,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the debutant is going to be then
delivered to you in the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not, as soon as you think or you know
that there it is, the bacterial infection,
[SPEAKER_01]: why not to moisture one piece of the
bread, put in front of the window and went
[SPEAKER_01]: for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be enough aspergillus and
penicillium molds that spread the surface
[SPEAKER_01]: of this bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe me, there is plenty of antibiotics
inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you do not know the dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not know the safety and it is very
inconvenient and very ugly to eat this
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of molded bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you trust that the final product with
antibiotics, which are produced on the
[SPEAKER_01]: same way, they are not put, okay,
bread somewhere, but I mean, I'm talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about GMP, but at the end of the day,
this is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trust the final product, but allow
patient to get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the goal of the regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope, as we met Caparagi this
morning, that the new legislation will be
[SPEAKER_06]: adopted soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, there will be a lot of
discussion, but we are coming to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And based on the oncologic patients,
also the Society Association of Oncologic
[SPEAKER_06]: Patients in Slovenia is strongly
supporting this movement.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I see in the audience Anna Lieter,
who is the president of that, and
[SPEAKER_06]: congratulate for all the efforts that you
are doing to these patients get a
[SPEAKER_06]: meaningful, meaningful advice at least
from the doctors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think we are rounding up this
session.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I emphasize here that to catch up
with the global advancement in Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_06]: we really must do foster.
[SPEAKER_06]: First, collaboration between science,
academia, and clinics on one hand,
[SPEAKER_06]: and industry on the other hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is clearly for what we show.
[SPEAKER_06]: For what we show.
[SPEAKER_06]: So foster the collaboration between
academia and clinics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Industry on one hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also this should be supported
financially, but public private
[SPEAKER_06]: partnership.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this would be more profitable than
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we have to be open also to
international financial networks to get
[SPEAKER_06]: support for this kind of research.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because so far, most of the research was
done based on the support of the pharma
[SPEAKER_06]: companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the public money in Slovenia nowadays
is spent for prohibition, first,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then how to prove that drugs are
toxic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Department of Toxicology in our
clinical center, University Clinical
[SPEAKER_06]: Center, is working intensely on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And making seminars and webinars on these
topics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not mentioning that cannabis can also help
cure some disease or at least help the
[SPEAKER_06]: symptoms to disappear.
[SPEAKER_06]: So also these regulatory experts and
agencies should work independently of the
[SPEAKER_06]: politics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or ideological obstacles, whatever they
are.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think that we will soon get to
that hopefully.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we will try to get that with all our
efforts and try to get more people
[SPEAKER_06]: involved in our cannabis research
development.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so thank you very much for your
attention for this.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's hear it for our
panelists.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I want to some questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely have time for questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Questions, questions, questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming over.
I don't need, I don't need.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we need, we need to hear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I hear you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we was talking now about anilizing of
the quality and the percentage of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids in cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my question is, how big is the problem?
[SPEAKER_04]: With cannabis plants, diseases,
and using of pesticides, herbicides,
[SPEAKER_04]: and other use of chemicals in farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're analyzing those samples,
is there, did you find something that can
[SPEAKER_04]: harm the health of users?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because obviously farmers have to use some
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would like to have this answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And please one another more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I answer this first?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you are meaning diseases of the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that Andrea would be the best
expert on this because she's dealing with
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Andrea, do you have any data on the
plants' viruses infection plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis plant viruses infection,
or bacteria, or whatever, or the
[SPEAKER_06]: pesticides, the harm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there are some infections,
of course, with viruses virus in hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: plant as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be treated, let's say,
with heat treatment or cold treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we cannot spray against it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are not allowed, let's say,
plant protection products in hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: production, which are, let's say,
registered.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are some which can be used for
ecological growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some, let's say, ecological
products which can be used against fungi,
[SPEAKER_02]: against some, let's say, predator mites
which can be used to strict or to control
[SPEAKER_02]: the other mites, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are strict regulations what can
you use.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are not a lot of them,
which is a general green deal in EU not to
[SPEAKER_02]: use plant protection products as much as
we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the market products, I don't have,
I just know what can be used in hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: growing for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know what is, the question is
what is going on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have those data.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there's a lot of
regulations on the European side on
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticides and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can ask our pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there?
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot?
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots and lots.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's all break into small groups.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, we just need to answer this
question first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allow me to add this very, very shortly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, you know, now,
due to the fact that we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: monograph, there is also one section about
the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as you are going to fulfill
this, you are free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you are on a safe side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't worry about this now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before, it was the responsibility of the
producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, there is a general legislation
in Europe, as was said, which pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: are permitted, currents, and so on,
so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, now we have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is your second question,
please?
[SPEAKER_02]: May I just add this before we are going
forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you buy, let's say, the hemp,
so cannabis ecological, biological
[SPEAKER_02]: certificate, before you get it,
you have the control.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few, let's say, organizations
in Slovenia which are doing samples,
[SPEAKER_02]: so blind sampling of the samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are doing the analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you cannot get the certificate if you
are not following the regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are few institutions which are
covering this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you cannot get their certificate very
easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we get to your second question,
let's, we'll give this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're good?
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, good day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one question for Professor David.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are producer of CBD oils for many
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, and one parent with a child who is
your patient come to us and ask for
[SPEAKER_03]: advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we created one oil which is 30% of
CBD, 10% of CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the beginning, we had some positive
results.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we tried to create something
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we add terpenoids, 1% in that oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after that, we get way better results.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my question is, do you have some data,
some knowledge about terpenoids that can
[SPEAKER_03]: help to calm the child?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we know that, let's say,
the Mersenne and alpha and beta pinins are
[SPEAKER_03]: doing a good job for now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that there is more room to
enhance those medications.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, we are still doing that under
cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are doing that regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really pure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's by GMP, HCCP, and ISO controlled.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pure about, I understand those
questions that people are asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, black market can't create that
kind of purity we can provide.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my question is, what can we do in
boundary of the regulations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we can do only like cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, you suggest to the parents
how they can use it better way.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we do more to help the patients?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you very much for the
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is actually a difficult question.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do know that flavonoids and terpenoids
and so on, they have a very good effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be a calming effect or just the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Professor Rousseau, the famous
neurologist, he did a lot of studies with
[SPEAKER_05]: these different chemo bars and with the
different extracts of different terpenoids
[SPEAKER_05]: concentration inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes, it adds the effect to the
cannabidiol and to THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes, it can completely change
the effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, for the time being, we are not
able to analyze it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will be very difficult because we
are always calculating the dose according
[SPEAKER_05]: to the patient's age and the patient's
weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, but calculating only cannabidiol
and THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we would go further and include the
terpenoids, maybe it will be, in the
[SPEAKER_05]: future, it will be definitely something
much more effective.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we are late.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we have some time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have like two minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Andrea Petre.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the CEO of ALCOS Bioproduct and Hemmed
Pharma, together with Daniel Hanganu,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the president of Hemmed Pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ask you a question, Professor
Borut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have done, in Poland and in Romania,
CBD as an alimentary supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the government of Slovenia accept on
mutual recognition to notify this product
[SPEAKER_00]: as supplement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because simply CBD is still, you are
talking about CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're speaking about the full
extract, full entourage CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that EFCA, this is still pending
situation with EFCA regarding the CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD is supposed to be a dietary supplement
or an oral food.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, it is not clear answer due to
the fact that the agency, I'm not talking
[SPEAKER_01]: now about the agency for medicine product,
but about some kind of unit dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: dietary supplements.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are very strict in terms of all
regulation, in terms of European Food
[SPEAKER_01]: Safety Authority.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not still any kind of decision
whether CBD, it could be a dietary
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, which means, that's why it was
said that it was like a cosmetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the mimics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know, but this is the only way.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Slovenia, strictly according to the
legislation of European Food Safety
[SPEAKER_01]: Authority, CBD is supposed to be an oral
food because it was consumed after 1997.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say no, but try, try.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all the time we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it once again for all our
panelists.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Turchi, Dr. Schuchin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very informative.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
Thank you.
