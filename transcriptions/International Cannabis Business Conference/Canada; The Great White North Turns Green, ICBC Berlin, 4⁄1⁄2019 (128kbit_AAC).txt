[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very warm welcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my third time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And first of all, let's give a round of
applause to ICBC organizers and Alex
[SPEAKER_07]: Rogers.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've done an amazing job to get us
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I get a little more mic?
[SPEAKER_07]: A little louder?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can yell louder, but we'll get it
louder.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is my third time here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I try and talk a little German when I
come to show respect to our local German
[SPEAKER_07]: friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I first got here, my first German
that I learned, I welcomed everyone in my
[SPEAKER_07]: panel and I said, willkommen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I was told, no, no, no,
no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not really how you would welcome
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then the second year, last year,
I tried something different.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, willkommen.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they said, OK, that's a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a little bit better, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit better.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this year, because I have such a
trouble after you go to the bars to find a
[SPEAKER_07]: bathroom.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so hard to find a bathroom in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they taught me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little bit better there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just really, really special also to be
sharing this stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a legend here earlier, Professor
Raphael Maschulam, who was one of my
[SPEAKER_07]: heroes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a cannabis educator, so I've been
talking about him for so long.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was awesome to see him.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we had so many other legends here,
Hilary Black, John Conroy, Mark Ware,
[SPEAKER_07]: all legends from Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's awesome to share this amazing
stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got an amazing panel, which we'll
get to.
[SPEAKER_07]: in a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wanted to point out, since I was
last here, a lot of things have happened
[SPEAKER_07]: since we were last here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We now have medical and pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_07]: We now have extracts and edibles
announced.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see when that actually happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was announced.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had legalization and retail.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, today, in my province of Ontario,
is the first day of sales.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm waiting to see some pictures of all
the lineups.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were supposed to have a lot of stores
open.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them weren't open.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little sensitive subject for certain
panelists here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll talk about that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we also had the Amnesty program
discussed, where we're going to remove
[SPEAKER_07]: people's criminal records for their
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that should be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe next year on our panel,
we'll talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wanted to start with a few stats.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think everyone was really interested.
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave some stats last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I said, I really liked it,
but try to talk a little slower with the
[SPEAKER_07]: stats, because they were trying to write
it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you all the stats after,
but I'll just want to throw a few out.
[SPEAKER_07]: With patients, the last numbers from
September were 342,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: We estimate there's about 400,000 patients
right now on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_07]: With about 124,000 shipments sent at that
point.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it comes to how many doctors and
health care practitioners, when I got in
[SPEAKER_07]: the industry in 2013, there was about 40
or so doctors prescribing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know how last month, or the last month
of record, or about January, 3,500 doctors
[SPEAKER_07]: or health care practitioners prescribed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're getting a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_07]: An estimated about 14,000 in total have
prescribed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, on the medical side, products from
January 2019, we had about 7,000 kilograms
[SPEAKER_07]: of dried cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had about 100,000 cannabis sold in that
month, which is a little bit down,
[SPEAKER_07]: which I have some theories on,
but we'll talk about it later.
[SPEAKER_07]: And about 7,800 liters of oil,
which is an increase of 48%.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we see a lot of uptick in oil on the
medical cannabis side.
[SPEAKER_07]: And dry flour is being kind of looked at
now on the retail and rec side.
[SPEAKER_07]: So possibly some people are putting it
aside for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last couple of stats, when I first
came here, my first year, we had about 40
[SPEAKER_07]: licensed producers when I first came on
the stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year, we had 97 licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And today, we've set at about 143 licensed
producers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last data I wanted to point out is
that the exports, which is a little bit of
[SPEAKER_07]: a sensitive subject here, I imagine.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they peaked in May of 2018,
where we sent about 339 kilos of dry
[SPEAKER_07]: flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: In August of this year, we sent zero.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in September, we sent one liter of
oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So sorry, again, 118 liters at one point
in the peak.
[SPEAKER_07]: August, we had zero.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in September, we sent one liter of
oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely feel the pain of what we're
hearing when it comes to all this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, to get into our panel, why don't we
start with an introduction of our esteemed
[SPEAKER_07]: panelists?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every year, I bring a great panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm very excited about this one in
particular.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ian, if you want to start us off?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the context there, Alex.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my name is Ian Dick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am the head of partnerships for
regulated industries within Shopify.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I kind of help steer the company toward
this market a few years ago, seeing the
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity in our country, the sort of
legislative open lane, if you want to call
[SPEAKER_05]: it, to apply what we already do more
broadly in the commerce world,
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of set ourselves as an
entrepreneurship company, allowing
[SPEAKER_05]: entrepreneurs to sell any product to
consumers where they want to buy them,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether that's on an online store,
at a point of sale, or through social
[SPEAKER_05]: channels.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're kind of there for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then more recently, we've had some
success in the cannabis space,
[SPEAKER_05]: in Canada specifically, helping licensed
producers, vertically integrated licensed
[SPEAKER_05]: producers sell directly to their patients,
as well as powering some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational operations, both government
and private, in the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name's Steven Verbeek.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the founder of Hello Cannabis Medical
and Education Centers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my third time in Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you again for having me here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We originally started with one mandate,
which was to help destigmatize cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: and to be able to help educate physicians
and essentially connect three dots.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the patients with physicians and
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: This started about seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has now evolved into eight different
projects in three continents.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been lovely.
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually have a working relationship
with everybody on this panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: In some degree, shape, or form,
Canada has a wonderful collaborative
[SPEAKER_06]: effort that's been, in my opinion,
a moving target that we are all lovingly
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to navigate through and collaborate
through.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are seeing some of the same
challenges in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are very much hoping to be able to
help the European and other markets around
[SPEAKER_06]: the world learn from our mistakes so we
can help roll out both medical and
[SPEAKER_06]: eventually a adult use market,
where everybody is able to benefit from a
[SPEAKER_06]: plant that I see is one of the most
disruptive entities that our world has
[SPEAKER_06]: currently seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name's Terry Roycroft.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm founder and CEO of MCRCI.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are a educational resource center as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started about 11 years ago in Canada,
being one of the first clinics of its
[SPEAKER_04]: kind.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been able to stay within the
different programs that have happened
[SPEAKER_04]: through Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Through Canada, we've had three different
programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've navigated them all to the current
ACMPR.
[SPEAKER_04]: We train physicians, educate patients,
and are currently looking again
[SPEAKER_04]: internationally here to bring some of the
SOPs and some of the knowledge that we've
[SPEAKER_04]: had to some of the countries over here
that have not had a chance to get
[SPEAKER_04]: education and are just rolling into the
medical regime right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we started, there was one
supplier.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one clinic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've seen it now grow to,
as Alex was saying through the other stats
[SPEAKER_04]: here, 145 LPs, numerous doctors and
clinics using the same type of model and
[SPEAKER_04]: supporting patients across the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do telemedicine as well as walk-in
clinics so that we can support patients
[SPEAKER_04]: that cannot make it to clinics and
patients that want to continue with a
[SPEAKER_04]: face-to-face interview or appointment with
doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Terry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew?
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Andrew Muroff, and I am a
recovering lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also a cannabis patient, an alcohol
cannabis patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a patient since 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the CEO of Strain Print Technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a data and analytics company in
Canada that helps patients to track their
[SPEAKER_03]: medical outcomes using technology,
using an app.
[SPEAKER_03]: All data is anonymous.
[SPEAKER_03]: We track basically pre- and
post-symptomatic state against route of
[SPEAKER_03]: administration, against the dose,
and then against the full chemical profile
[SPEAKER_03]: of the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't care whether it's an OG Cush
or we don't care what you decide to call
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We care what's the actual ingredients of
the products that you're taking at the
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our platform is HIPAA, PIPAA, and FIPAA
compliant and will soon be GDPR compliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the only business analytics
platform that sits on top of a real data
[SPEAKER_03]: set.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today we have over 1.2 million
patient-reported outcomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the largest set of its kind in the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we feel very fortunate to have grown
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's tens of thousands of Canadian
patients who are tracking every single
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we power a lot of decision-making
across the industry in Canada,
[SPEAKER_03]: licensed producers, clinics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clinics are able to track their patients'
performance in real time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Licensed producers are able to see what
products they should be carrying in their
[SPEAKER_03]: product set.
[SPEAKER_03]: And doctors are able to see what products
are working for what.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we today have the only solution that's
in place in a pharmacy in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that solution basically helps that
pharmacy to deliver the right treatment
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendations for their patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to recognize for one
second, if I can, a couple of pioneers in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Canadian industry, John Conroy and
Jerry Roycroft here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are others in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel that we should all be thankful
that they've put in their time over the
[SPEAKER_03]: last 20 or so years to make this industry
possible in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think that our experience in
Canada has really helped to influence
[SPEAKER_03]: what's happening in the rest of the world
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's a good point.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of people grinded their teeth,
took a lot of bullets for us to be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I always like to acknowledge that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a quick round of applause for,
yes, John Conroy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Mark Ware, when he was a doctor doing
education, he was a gentleman speaking
[SPEAKER_07]: earlier, he was going to talks when no one
even wanted to hear him talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I was doing my education,
I'll be completely honest, I would
[SPEAKER_07]: actually say, Dr. Mark Ware says,
and Dr. Mark Swear's research,
[SPEAKER_07]: so I would kind of hide behind him.
[SPEAKER_07]: He'd be my shield because they could maybe
try to poke holes in what I said.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I knew he was very smart.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I knew that it would be very hard to
poke holes in what he said.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk about access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Access to cannabis has actually changed
since I was last here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we now have different retail
experiences.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have it on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_07]: We now have some pharmacies also carrying
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have the adult use or
recreational side, where that's also
[SPEAKER_07]: another way that's being sold.
[SPEAKER_07]: And every province has their own rules,
which is very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, I feel like Germany
can appreciate this because there's also
[SPEAKER_07]: different provinces with different rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we can just talk about the different
retail experience and how medical versus
[SPEAKER_07]: rec looks like in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if someone wants to start us off to
kind of give their thoughts.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's on it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Want to start off?
[SPEAKER_06]: So Hello Cannabis is actually very
fortunate to be involved on both sides of
[SPEAKER_06]: this.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I stated before, our original mandate
was to be able to help connect the three
[SPEAKER_06]: dots of physicians, patients, and product.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has evolved where we were fortunate
enough to partner with one of the 25
[SPEAKER_06]: lottery winners to open up one of the
first retail stores in the province of
[SPEAKER_06]: Ontario.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our original mandate was to try and
truly differentiate between medical and
[SPEAKER_06]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's quite interesting when it's
the same plant and often the same product
[SPEAKER_06]: that straddles both of those sides.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a medical user.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will candidly say that there are
times where I use it recreationally as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't pretend that I'm actually
medicating.
[SPEAKER_06]: The analogy that I say is no doctor is
ever going to tell somebody that is
[SPEAKER_06]: suffering from pain to go buy a brown bag
of heroin and put it in a needle and shoot
[SPEAKER_06]: up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm not saying that you are not
extracting medicine from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like when you are rolling up a rolled
joint.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is a dried flour in a bleached sheet
of white paper with glue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something else that I don't think many
doctors would actually would like somebody
[SPEAKER_06]: to medicate with.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not denouncing that you are extracting
medicine from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there is a reason why over 90% of the
patients with Hello Cannabis are using
[SPEAKER_06]: sublingual oils.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do believe that we need to have a
separation between medical and recreation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you are able to do that,
you are able to facilitate all of the
[SPEAKER_06]: different medical and adult use users.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you are able to start differentiating
between different products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are all fantastic points and I fully
agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as Shopify is concerned,
in terms of the software that is involved
[SPEAKER_05]: or the solution that is involved,
the two experiences, we are trying to make
[SPEAKER_05]: them somewhat similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I mean by that is when you are
looking at the customer journey,
[SPEAKER_05]: the patient journey through an online
buying experience, what we are trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: do is tailor it to what the LP is trying
to do is tailor it to the patient as much
[SPEAKER_05]: as they can so that the products that they
see and the amounts that they can purchase
[SPEAKER_05]: are conducive to their prescription
information.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a very personalized buying
experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think recreational cannabis wants to
achieve that same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to educate the consumer and to
have these personalized experiences
[SPEAKER_05]: because we were talking about this
backstage.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the level of understanding of the
product still has so far to go so that
[SPEAKER_05]: people understand what dosage and what
potency is going to work best for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's an exciting time right now
because I think there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: innovation happening in that space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to put them on blast, but Drew over
there with Strain Print is effectively
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to do that, try to unlock the
secrets of this plant and allow people to
[SPEAKER_05]: understand how to effectively index their
body and what's good for them and what's
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially bad for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's other people trying to do this as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: For Shopify's part, we want to kind of be
this central hub that these technologies
[SPEAKER_05]: can build into to then be layered into the
commerce experience and overall just lift
[SPEAKER_05]: up the industry through education.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's interesting is this,
we had different experiences with our
[SPEAKER_04]: patients before legalization came to
Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was still a lack of education and a
lack of information that a lot of patients
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when it became legal, we saw an
increase in people coming to see us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought it was going to be the opposite
at first.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what happened is a lot of these people
felt more empowered to go and try cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: once it became legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though the program was in place for
the previous 18 years, people still
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't aware that there was this access
to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're talking a lot about seniors now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've seen a huge influx in patients
coming medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've gone to the recreational stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by law, they're not allowed to give
any medical information or even relate a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain strain to a specific illness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where a lot of people have been
turned around and are now coming back to
[SPEAKER_04]: the medical side so they can actually get
that information.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've seen quite an increase in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And usually it's the seniors market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fast and growing segment that we've
seen now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they walk into a recreational
store, ask for information.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are now being directed either out the
door because they can't give information
[SPEAKER_04]: or we're working with some of these groups
putting this together so that they can
[SPEAKER_04]: direct them to a medical clinic to get
more information on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is very interesting that that amount
of increase in patient flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we were legal, it was very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We thought it was going to be the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw the same experience after after the
program was announced or after the program
[SPEAKER_03]: launched in October, we saw an increase in
what we're calling elder care.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's basically us as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So an older demographic who is more open
to using cannabis and across the board are
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in getting off of polypharma.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's the concept of having
multiple medications for the same symptom,
[SPEAKER_03]: one to offset the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're seeing a lot of that on our side,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great answers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one thing that's also very important
that we find in Canada and it's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be very important here in Germany is the
issue about compliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Compliance can be your best friend,
but it can also be your enemy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted someone to hear from the
panelists some of the things that they
[SPEAKER_07]: see.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are the good things about being in a
heavily regulated, heavily regulated
[SPEAKER_07]: market?
[SPEAKER_07]: And what are some things that can
potentially hurt in a heavily regulated
[SPEAKER_07]: market?
[SPEAKER_07]: An important thing to note is you can be
as compliant as you want, but your
[SPEAKER_07]: partners that you work with also have to
be in compliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just some thoughts about some pros and
cons about being compliant and the
[SPEAKER_07]: importance of making sure that your
partner is compliant, because anything
[SPEAKER_07]: they do actually hurts you as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Andrew, if you want to start us off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're working with some of the largest
both government and private entities in
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada on driving what we call
transparency and standardization for
[SPEAKER_03]: products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, we don't actually have
consistency among the licensed producers
[SPEAKER_03]: on what they label in their products and
what they share with expected expanded
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very important that we understand
that patients want to know what's in their
[SPEAKER_03]: products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doctors want to know what are in those
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's now going to be driven from the
top levels down where the pharmacies are
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, we need to know what's in these
products or we're not going to recommend
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Health Canada, which is the governing
board that actually decides what gets
[SPEAKER_03]: bought and sold and who's licensed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also would like to see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would like to see the industry
regulate themselves, but that's not
[SPEAKER_03]: happening right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there will be a little bit of a push
from industry to drive that and government
[SPEAKER_03]: to drive that down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we see from our perspective is
when we're working with LPs and any of the
[SPEAKER_04]: other peripheral groups that we work with
is sometimes that lack of consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for instance, we are working with
patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: We recommend a certain strain the
physician does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our aftercare specialists help them go to
that location or that particular LP.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if that LP has some kind of a recall
or they've got mold and mildew or
[SPEAKER_04]: something's happened to that product,
that directly affects the companies
[SPEAKER_04]: underneath it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we're working in conjunction with
them, something like that would really
[SPEAKER_04]: affect it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our reputations as well, we'd make
recommendations to a certain group and
[SPEAKER_04]: they've got inferior product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is where, you know, working in a
partnership, everyone has to be on point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if one of that pieces of the chain is
broken, well, that creates an issue for
[SPEAKER_04]: the whole chain, the supply, the patients,
the doctors, everyone gets impacted by
[SPEAKER_04]: that link being broken.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it can happen in any one of the steps
of that chain that goes around.
[SPEAKER_04]: The physician could be giving wrong
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be wrong product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's really important for all of us
groups to work together and have a
[SPEAKER_04]: consistent understanding of what we're
supplying and our roles in that chain so
[SPEAKER_04]: that everyone gets the medicine they need
and it's consistent and it's safe at that
[SPEAKER_04]: point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to completely concur with what
Terry's saying here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are basically the front line for
patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if a patient is upset or unhappy with
their product, Hello Cannabis or MCRCI are
[SPEAKER_06]: the people that hear it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we recommend a product and that
product is not as it stated or it runs out
[SPEAKER_06]: and we've run into many supply issues in
Canada, we're the ones that face the brunt
[SPEAKER_06]: of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, our bottom line and
solvency is dependent on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to come full circle back to Alex's
original question with respect to
[SPEAKER_06]: regulation and I see a value in somewhat
having an unregulated system, but of
[SPEAKER_06]: course it needs to have a balance with
regulatory systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you're looking at a medical
component, clearly you can't have an
[SPEAKER_06]: unregulated market.
[SPEAKER_06]: It opens up the ability for the black
market to take in and you lack that
[SPEAKER_06]: consistency and standardization which is
required with the medical product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now with a regulated product that are
regulated industry, you can start getting
[SPEAKER_06]: this over regulation which limits the
ability for these LPs to be able to create
[SPEAKER_06]: that supply chain and to be able to create
that quality that patients want.
[SPEAKER_06]: So finding that balance between an over
regulated market and an under regulated
[SPEAKER_06]: market, in my opinion, is one of the
pivotal things that the European markets
[SPEAKER_06]: really need to look at.
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, I don't have the full
answer for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are navigating through it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a moving target, but you need to
find a balance where you are able to keep
[SPEAKER_06]: a standardized product that is regulated
where you can confidently have physicians
[SPEAKER_06]: back this product and have companies and
clinics like ourselves to be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: support this product while not restricting
them from being able to create a supply
[SPEAKER_06]: chain that could break.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because once that chain is broken,
any of the one link in that chain is
[SPEAKER_06]: broken, everybody feels it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why we're all a collaborative
effort here and why all of us work
[SPEAKER_06]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good point, Ian.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I mean, that's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I touched on a few points,
but to my point about consumer education,
[SPEAKER_05]: compliance is required in order to create
a consistent reproducible product that
[SPEAKER_05]: then when you understand these things
about it, it's going to be consistent each
[SPEAKER_05]: time you use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: For our part, we try to strike this exact
balance that Stephen's talking about of
[SPEAKER_05]: create as frictionless a buying experience
as we possibly can while also adhering to
[SPEAKER_05]: the strict regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it is exactly that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an ongoing conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a moving target.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is informed by events like this
where we all get together and we talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about it and we share things that have
worked and things that haven't worked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully, legislators and regulators
look to the market and try to ingest
[SPEAKER_05]: information from that to make sure that it
is this collaborative process where we're
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of working together to craft this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, as you say, striking that balance
is key because the unregulated market,
[SPEAKER_05]: the black market, is not beholden to any
of these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's much more frictionless.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a cross provincial A-B test going
on right now in Canada that we will share
[SPEAKER_05]: the results of when it's a little further
along.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should have some updates on that next
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: But to that point, we've learned a lot of
lessons.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been at this for about six years.
[SPEAKER_07]: As an industry, it started in 2013.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've made some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Germany and other emerging
markets can learn from some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe, Stephen, if you want to start
off with some of the mistakes that we've
[SPEAKER_07]: made and what we've learned.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not fair.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know all about mistakes, don't you?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a long, long list.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can say some of the mistakes that we
saw from a regulatory perspective is,
[SPEAKER_06]: again, circling right back to this
overregulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very challenging for LPs to be able
to increase their capacity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Say you bought a 40,000 square foot
facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's certainly not enough to be able to
facilitate a large medical market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you create so much regulation
that you cannot expand this, your supply
[SPEAKER_06]: chain gets completely broken down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say one of the personal mistakes
that I made as a business was,
[SPEAKER_06]: one, not being able to facilitate proper
funding for scalability.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can give a personal experience with
respect to my failures, a young CEO A lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of CEOs, I find they're drawn to
empowering people and hiring people that
[SPEAKER_06]: they see potential in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's something really special about
seeing talent and being able to foster and
[SPEAKER_06]: nurture that talent and see them exceed
their own expectations of what you expect
[SPEAKER_06]: out of them as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of my favorite parts about
being a leader.
[SPEAKER_06]: One big mistake I made is when you have 13
people that you empower and you see big
[SPEAKER_06]: talent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also see you as the leader and
more or less the nucleus of all of this
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, they need your
leadership.
[SPEAKER_06]: And your knowledge to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's completely unscalable when you
have 13 people that are looking at you to
[SPEAKER_06]: be able to lead them every single day
while you're also trying to scale a
[SPEAKER_07]: company.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I thought you were going to say that
everything's been perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we maybe fool everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's April Fool's.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess you didn't want to make that
joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's also the second mistake I've made
in this panel right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm off to a great start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alex, thanks for reminding me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was going to say that I like your
story there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tend to try to surround myself with
people that are way smarter than me so
[SPEAKER_05]: that it doesn't all land on me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all I'll add to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a blooper reel.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a blooper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the mistakes that we kind of
participated in in very earlier stages was
[SPEAKER_04]: the lack of being able to work in
conjunction with the colleges for the
[SPEAKER_04]: doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to get up to speed much quicker
and get more educated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is when in the earlier days was
very difficult because the doctors were
[SPEAKER_04]: being actually reprimanded and told not to
support cannabis, even though there was a
[SPEAKER_04]: legal program in the country to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you've got the medical body
saying this is not a quantified medicine,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's not enough studies, and you've got
the ability for doctors to do it and
[SPEAKER_04]: thousands of patients asking those
doctors, this was a real challenge and one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the breakdowns that we saw in regards
to be able to support those patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we go around the country and we're
seeing the resistance we still see from
[SPEAKER_04]: physicians, even with the large demand for
product, that is one of the challenges
[SPEAKER_04]: that we have that I see that we need to
really push forward on getting more
[SPEAKER_04]: education to those doctors and the
colleges themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though we have doctors that are
willing to do it, the colleges need to
[SPEAKER_04]: take a closer look at this so they can
actually support that initiative rather
[SPEAKER_04]: than resist it.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Canada, the CMA, Canadian Medical
Association, had a statement, the
[SPEAKER_04]: president stated or the CEO stated at one
time, that they were glad that
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational was coming in because they
wouldn't have to follow through with the
[SPEAKER_04]: medical program.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, they should get rid of the
medical program.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is something that was very serious
in our side of it to have someone of that
[SPEAKER_04]: nature come out with a statement like that
because there's no way medical is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: disappear.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's too many patients, there's too
much benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we see is a direct separation of
this industry, the exact same plant being
[SPEAKER_04]: used for two different segments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people think when you're
growing cannabis, you're growing medical
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, you're growing recreational
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same product being processed at
the end of that grow period to facilitate
[SPEAKER_04]: either one of those markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a breakdown in the medical
regime that we see.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think anyone taking lessons from
that and from Canada would be looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: that to get the education from the
colleges to get on board more so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And education is the magic word.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to talk about that in a
second.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll talk about the CMA in a moment.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Andrew, any thoughts on that question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I have to reiterate what
Terry was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the CMA doesn't support the cause,
it really puts a damper on the good work
[SPEAKER_03]: that people are doing and the improvements
that thousands of patients are seeing on a
[SPEAKER_03]: daily basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get your medical associations on side
and educate it as fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you've got to remember when that
comes from a source like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: patients that are hearing that are now
maybe reluctant to go down that path when
[SPEAKER_04]: they hear one of the top authorities
making those statements.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not fair to the patients either
when they are put in that position.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to remember in Canada,
the program was started not because
[SPEAKER_03]: legislature said, yeah, you know,
we should legalize this product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was because the court said it's a
fundamental right and freedom to use it as
[SPEAKER_03]: a medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they pushed it to the legislature and
said, create a program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've evolved since then,
thankfully.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can understand why the 80 years of
prohibition have left us with a dearth of
[SPEAKER_03]: research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's a lot of research in the last
10 or 20 years that is really starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: ramp up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly the work of Dr. Mishulam
predating that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we don't start looking at
observational data today, we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: wait 10 years before the doctors are happy
with what's coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the last 20 years in Canada and North
America, there were numerous studies done
[SPEAKER_04]: on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But 96% of those were looking at the
negative effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where it's changing now.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more research being done looking
at the positive effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was really a kind of deterrent
and what the medical associations look at,
[SPEAKER_04]: our studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was really a challenge and one
of the roadblocks as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, good point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ian, do you have anything to add?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, these are all great
salient points for the medical space,
[SPEAKER_05]: just for the rec side in terms of like
mistakes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's really important to look at
how quickly as a country we have done
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it kind of had to be done that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had to be done very, very quickly to
make sure that the path didn't deviate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you do something like that,
you stand up this industry or bring this
[SPEAKER_05]: industry into the mainstream or into the
light, there's going to be lots of bumps
[SPEAKER_05]: and bruises.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're not going to get it right
exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were joking like if we had stood up the
rec side of things and everything went
[SPEAKER_05]: swimmingly well and there was not a single
problem, I don't know, I would have
[SPEAKER_05]: assumed I was unconscious in some sort of
dream state.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's no perfection.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we're still striving for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one thing I wanted to point out that
Terry brought up, so the Canadian Medical
[SPEAKER_07]: Association, they did come out and say
that they don't actually want a medical
[SPEAKER_07]: system, that they wanted to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wanted to put a little context to
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is an important lesson I think
that Germany can learn from.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what we did at first, so the
government went to the doctors,
[SPEAKER_07]: to those Canadian Medical Association,
they said, we're going to consult with you
[SPEAKER_07]: on this program.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're thinking of having you do the
medical authorizations.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they said, great, let's have this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently, the way I was told in
speaking with them is they said they woke
[SPEAKER_07]: up one day, and they were told that this
is what's happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said, hey, what happened to all
our consultation?
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of politics involved,
and there's a lot of bitterness there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lesson that could be learned is try
and involve the medical community right
[SPEAKER_07]: from the start.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to set up this alternative medical
community of selling directly to patients
[SPEAKER_07]: and opening up separate clinics because
doctors weren't prescribing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there's a lesson to be learned
there, it's try and include the community
[SPEAKER_07]: and try to work through the community
rather than try to avoid them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because by avoiding them, you get other
problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remember going to conferences in
2013 when I started, and our minister of
[SPEAKER_07]: health, Rona Ambrose, she would say,
cannabis is not an approved medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis is not good for anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I would be at a conference,
a medical conference, the next day amongst
[SPEAKER_07]: pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people would walk by and be like,
didn't I just hear you're not even a real
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing here?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, well, I have a license to be
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are some crazy times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that had the result as well,
that all the Canadian pharmacies didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: get on board right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we have this vertical
integration direct to patient system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're getting on board.
[SPEAKER_07]: And full circle, we do have pharmacies on
board.
[SPEAKER_07]: The largest pharmacy chain in Canada,
Shoppers Drug Mart, is also now on board.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we expect a lot more to come through.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a key thing that every year I come,
and it's a key thing, and I really want to
[SPEAKER_07]: touch on again, is education.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't stress enough, everyone's so
obsessed with marketing and promotion.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the right way to talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis doesn't need to be marketed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't need to be promoted.
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to be educated on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just did my first non-medical
education last week, because now we have
[SPEAKER_07]: retail stores.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's so many similarities between
recreational and medical.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think from an outside, you think there's
a lot of differences.
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, people are trying to find an
effective outcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to spend money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of paying and sleep management,
they're looking to go to a concert or go
[SPEAKER_07]: to a movie or something after a date,
whether it goes good or bad, maybe a
[SPEAKER_07]: different type of variety.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the end of the day, there's a lot
of similarities.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we can just quickly touch on
education, because I can't stress enough
[SPEAKER_07]: how important that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's helped us so much when we figured it
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And everyone here knows the value of
education.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe if we can start at the end with
Andrew and what your thoughts are on
[SPEAKER_07]: education, maybe add some advice on how
Germany can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell you how much we've learned
just watching the data grow that we've
[SPEAKER_03]: been capturing over the last three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like how many sativa is actually
our high end myrsine and cause drowsiness.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sativa indica doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we hear that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, people are still talking in terms
of sativa indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to teach that there's more than
just the physical appearance of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to teach that there's more than
just THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's up to 450 chemical constituents in
every single plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's different every time you grow it
and every batch, even if it's grown in the
[SPEAKER_03]: same facility by the same people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot that we have to
understand in terms of chemical
[SPEAKER_03]: constituents.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot we have to understand about
anybody's endocannabinoid reception
[SPEAKER_03]: system, which is determined by genetics
and many other factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to understand dosing much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to continue to learn as we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unbiased plug, it's all about data.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you feel like we need to also be
mindful that the average consumer isn't a
[SPEAKER_05]: super science person that's going to be
able to understand all of that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like to package it in a more digestible
format?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think what we do is help to arm the
people who are creating the curriculums,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you guys, and put them in the hands
of the patients and the doctors.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's enough data out there now to
create curriculums that will be very
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial to doctors and patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's up to you guys who all have that
great educational background.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that was one of the biggest issues
when we started.
[SPEAKER_04]: As, again, when we started 11 years ago,
there was very little information out
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And education was paramount for our
patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a program.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: People looked at cannabis from a
recreational point of view of people
[SPEAKER_04]: getting stoned, the old Cheech and Chong
sort of scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we started to do the medical side
of it, we didn't have a lot of education.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really had to take that from some of
the original pioneers who were working
[SPEAKER_04]: with patients through compassion clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really had to get some knowledge
from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get our doctors on board.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start to train other doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was a real issue because we
didn't have the ammunition at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was really difficult, in many
cases, to get it to pass along to the
[SPEAKER_04]: patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when a patient comes to talk to us,
they have many, many questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can't just learn it from reading.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to have a direct conversation
with their physician.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we do training for pharmacists,
which, again, we started several years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting enough, when this program came
into effect in Canada originally,
[SPEAKER_04]: they had invited the pharmacists and
pharmacy organizations to be part and
[SPEAKER_04]: parcel of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They declined to be part of the
organization at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very interesting now that after
all this time has come through,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're probably talking 15 years ago when
that program came about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're coming back on board because
you see the benefits of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the earlier stages, if they would
have been included, I think we might have
[SPEAKER_04]: seen a lot different program than we do
now because this is where people are going
[SPEAKER_04]: back to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even when they talk to their doctors,
they still have many questions for their
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in many cases, they feel more
comfortable talking to the pharmacist than
[SPEAKER_04]: even their doctor, given some of the
things that happened in the past,
[SPEAKER_04]: which helped us create this program where
people were getting kicked out of their
[SPEAKER_04]: doctor's offices for even asking to be
prescribed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's changed dramatically since that
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how it started, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: People can't believe that someone would be
threatened to be kicked out if they say,
[SPEAKER_07]: if I find out you're using cannabis,
I won't even see you anymore as a doctor.
[SPEAKER_07]: People just cannot understand that that's
what was going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully that never happens here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve, some thoughts?
[SPEAKER_06]: My orthopedic surgeon actually said the
exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he is now somebody that is referring
patients to Hello Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that transition happened over the
course of seven years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it does require quite a lot of
patience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: All kinds of patience.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with respect to education, truly one of
our mandates is, of course, trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: relieve all of this misinformation that's
out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Andrew touched on one of my favorite
ones, which is when you go into many of
[SPEAKER_06]: the so-called gray area, which in my
opinion, in the law's opinion,
[SPEAKER_06]: is essentially a black market area,
they have this common statement like,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, sativa is something that's more
cerebral that you want to smoke during the
[SPEAKER_06]: day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And an indica is something that is more
sedative and they want to smoke that at
[SPEAKER_06]: night.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reality is that there are sativas
available that have the polar opposite
[SPEAKER_06]: effect of what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we now have the data that's able to do
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our original goal was to be able to
actually educate the physician so that way
[SPEAKER_06]: they were more comfortable when you go to
see a doctor and they say, take three of
[SPEAKER_06]: these pills every four hours, you don't
question it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think 99% of people just do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And physicians weren't comfortable doing
that at first.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was what Terry was able to pave
the way for many other people like myself
[SPEAKER_06]: to follow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was fortunate enough as a previous
role as an investment banker, I knew a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of physicians and I suffered a tragic
injury that unfortunately rendered me as
[SPEAKER_06]: an opioid addict.
[SPEAKER_06]: I quit two months into a lifelong
prescription and I used medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they saw firsthand how it worked for
me, but this was completely anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_06]: We now have data and thankfully because of
Andrew as well where we have all joined
[SPEAKER_06]: forces combining data, combined with the
pioneers, combining with people that have
[SPEAKER_06]: a very interesting and powerful origin
story and connections with physicians to
[SPEAKER_06]: all combined forces in one giant circle,
allowing e-commerce to step in to be able
[SPEAKER_06]: to increase access.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a very large group effort
where I truly believe that the education
[SPEAKER_06]: needs to start with physicians.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once the physicians are converted,
they will bring their patients in and then
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody else will follow.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are able to educate physicians,
I think you will be able to streamline
[SPEAKER_06]: this process and be able to relieve a lot
of the headaches that we faced here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what, that's hopefully
something that people here are taking back
[SPEAKER_07]: with them is that it does feel very
competitive, but it's important that you
[SPEAKER_07]: collaborate together.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're trying to build an industry
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes it feels a little weird that
you think you're giving away your secrets.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's very few secrets in this industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the beginning, everyone's so
worried about, oh, they're going to learn
[SPEAKER_07]: what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you want to do is pretty much the
same thing everybody wants to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the faster you realize that you have
more in common, start working together,
[SPEAKER_07]: create an industry, and then you can worry
about competing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I want to just do before,
I feel like there's some questions here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll just do super quick rapid fire,
the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: Innovations and technologies you're
excited about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's two innovations and
technologies up here besides yourselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: What other innovations and technology are
excited about the future?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just quick bullets and then we're going to
go to the audience for some questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, not to continue to say this,
but anything that exactly allows these
[SPEAKER_05]: patients and recreational consumers
understand the product better.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to get to the level of where
alcohol and tea is right now, where you
[SPEAKER_05]: know the type and the amount that works
for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to get to that level, both from a
medicinal standpoint and from a rec
[SPEAKER_05]: standpoint, but also in general,
just innovation in the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone was mentioning from the audience
in the last panel about oils and vape pens
[SPEAKER_05]: and edibles and nano emulsified beverages.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what really excites me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think very quickly those types of
products are going to eclipse flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and especially beverages.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are socialized to drink and be merry
with our friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once you can do that in a way that
isn't so calorically overwhelming,
[SPEAKER_05]: some really cool stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: With respect to innovations, I'm very much
looking forward to regulated standardized
[SPEAKER_06]: forms of different product delivery
systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're starting to look at nasal inhalers,
topicals that actually penetrate through
[SPEAKER_06]: the epidermis, even receiving things with
elderly patients and pediatric patients
[SPEAKER_06]: where suppositories that bypass the liver
are being used.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are many different ways to
administer this product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we look at the medical delivery
systems, I think the innovative products
[SPEAKER_06]: that are there are going to be able to
help a lot of people and avoid a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: pain and suffering that unfortunately has
ironically been induced by the
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmaceutical industry that is using,
in my opinion, and I believe many others,
[SPEAKER_06]: far more harmful substances, administers
in far more painful and inappropriate
[SPEAKER_07]: ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: And suppositories, although very popular
in hospice and palliative care,
[SPEAKER_07]: not popular parties.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not happening at the recreational
world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe not the parties you go to,
Alex.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not in any of the parties I go to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear in Berlin it might be a party.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't mention that club.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, Terry?
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, I won't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a quick bullet to quick innovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the innovations we're going to
see here, very simply, we're going to see
[SPEAKER_04]: a separation of the medical market and the
recreational market.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way the products are marketed and the
way they're developed are going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see the pills, the patches,
the suppositories on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll see a lack of connection to
specific strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas when we see the recreational
market and we see it going ahead,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're going to continue to work within
the culture, talking about different
[SPEAKER_04]: strains that are popular and more of the
experience you're going to have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we're seeing now is people
looking and marketing towards experiences.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to take this joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to enjoy a movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's the area we're going to
see as we push forward for rec.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then medical is going to fall right
into the typical medical products that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're used to seeing on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand in Europe, you've already
had CBD here for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to start to happen in the TAC
side of things, where you'll have specific
[SPEAKER_04]: products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the names and the culture will
roll through on the recreational side.
[SPEAKER_07]: Andrew, and then we're going to take a few
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think exactly right, we're going to
start to see real, true personalized
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to see formulated full
spectrum products that will be in whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: route of administration or whatever
recreational form, and that will be true
[SPEAKER_03]: personalized forms.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just a quick one to add, different
cannabinoids and terpenes are going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: important.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to start seeing a lot of
devices, like a vape pen of just maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should go visit him over there that
has it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's all kinds of different future
technologies relating to which
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoids and terpenes will do
different things in research.
[SPEAKER_07]: Questions from the audience?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for the panel one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have time for one, maybe two
questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold the mic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Annie Sulkana, New Frontier Data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just wondering, what is the
physician patient privacy model in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: as regards sharing the experience of a
patient?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it's, as you would expect,
the highest level of privacy regulation
[SPEAKER_03]: around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything that has to do with the
medical record has to be dealt with in
[SPEAKER_03]: absolute privacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how else to answer it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about as tough as any other market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's higher than we call it military
grade.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and there's a challenge right now
where a lot of people are collecting data.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't have the patient's
authority to do the data, like in a string
[SPEAKER_07]: print, they get the data from the patient.
[SPEAKER_07]: But some other people, they collect the
data from the EMR and from the doctors.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the patient never actually gave them
access.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is there some interesting technology
with using AI to answer questions and do
[SPEAKER_07]: that where no one's actually collecting
the data?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all very anonymous.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that could be something very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, we have very high regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you want to quickly touch on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for Shopify.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually set up a Canadian hosted
version of our product.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually a really cool blog post
that our production engineering team put
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go check out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also plug into some of the major
compliance platforms in a completely
[SPEAKER_05]: anonymized way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just sort of get a success or
failure notification from whether or not
[SPEAKER_05]: they're a patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that's all the Shopify even
really sees from the seed to sale or
[SPEAKER_05]: prescription patient management platform.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Time for one more.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got the last question for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot for taking my question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several Canadian producers own and operate
their own clinics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just wondering what your thoughts
are on there for the potential conflict of
[SPEAKER_01]: interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, by law, they're not supposed to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they have done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They try and separate themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little it is a little conflict of
interest in that if you own that clinic,
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously you want to direct them to your
clinic supply products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as again, as I said, by law,
they're not supposed to be doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They found end arounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We feel that the patient should have a
much wider variety and much wider choice
[SPEAKER_04]: that they have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And through our clinics, we work with all
the with all the main LPs as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And any patient can choose the location or
the LP that he wants to go through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we help them with making those choices
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the clinic LP owning its own clinic,
you know, it's difficult for the patient
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes to get a wide variety of choice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very common question we get.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Guinness does Guinness own their
own bar.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a common thing I get.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve, last last comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we got to go to any last
comments.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to maintain objectivity,
especially if you're actually caring about
[SPEAKER_06]: a patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to be able to direct them to
exactly what is in the best interest of
[SPEAKER_06]: the patient while maintaining compliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you own an LP, that clearly is a
massive conflict of interest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we very much disagree with that model.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just say contrast that to the to the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: experience where they're all vertically
integrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a different lens in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lens in Canada is public safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lens in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: is commercial.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we're around for more questions,
if you have any other questions and
[SPEAKER_07]: hopefully we'll back next year to talk
more about the fantastic material once
[SPEAKER_02]: again for Alex and the rest of the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you can accost them in the
hallway and they will be happy to answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are like Aerosmith or something
or right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Loverboy, that's a Canadian band.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's working for the weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rush.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's five of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rush is a power trio.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, this next panel is going to be
entirely in German.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't speak German, you can go
back and get a translator from the
[SPEAKER_02]: translation booth and that will help you
to understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you could just nod and smile.
Thank you very much.
