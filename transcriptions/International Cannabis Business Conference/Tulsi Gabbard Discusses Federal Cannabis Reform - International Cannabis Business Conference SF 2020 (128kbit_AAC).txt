[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Representative Gabbard?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for calling in to the
International Cannabis Business Conference
[SPEAKER_01]: here in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very excited to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Representative Gabbard, you're
crisscrossing the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're hearing from Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they telling you about medical
marijuana reform and adult use cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the sense of where America is at?
[SPEAKER_00]: America is more united around this issue
than those in Washington would have you
[SPEAKER_00]: believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing thing and really hope
inspiring actually to see how,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at my town halls, I'm here in
New Hampshire right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're holding town hall meetings every
single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've held over about 120 town halls here
for the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at every single one, we have
Democrats, Republicans, independents and
[SPEAKER_00]: libertarians coming together talking about
the issues of the day and this upcoming
[SPEAKER_00]: election.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this issue around legalizing cannabis
is one that has such incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-partisan support and that people in
some of the most rural conservative towns
[SPEAKER_00]: here in New Hampshire also support.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frustration here in New Hampshire is
that even as it is the live free or die
[SPEAKER_00]: state, it has still the most restrictive
laws relating to cannabis, even medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in a neighborhood of
Massachusetts, Vermont and other states
[SPEAKER_00]: that have done so much more to legalize
and ease people's access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We held a panel here recently,
a presidential forum that we hosted and
[SPEAKER_00]: brought in different leaders here,
legislative leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a woman who's a nurse who is
advocating for the legalization of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis with the Nurses Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a woman who is on a medical board
here who herself needs needed medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and who's the citizen's advocate
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they brought an incredible treasure
trove of real life experiences and the
[SPEAKER_00]: real challenges that folks in New England
are facing, which I think are reflective
[SPEAKER_00]: of a lot of the challenges that we're
facing across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hopeful thing is that this is not
a right versus left issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for most Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a question of freedom and fairness
and choice and for people to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: access this plant as medicine to regain
their lives, to achieve wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many cases, even as we're dealing
with the opioid crisis, to save people's
[SPEAKER_00]: lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical marijuana is polling at 91 percent
in America right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think clean water polls at 91
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been in Congress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you you've helped push legislation
forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you tell people when they ask
what's the disconnect here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any hopes for congressional
reform in 2020 or 2021 with regard to
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really it's really going to require
the kind of grassroots driven pressure on
[SPEAKER_00]: members of Congress to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continue to be surprised even as you're
talking about the approval ratings,
[SPEAKER_00]: the popularity or the favorability ratings
across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most states have have legalized some form
or another of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still in Congress, there's a lot of
unwillingness to even look at the facts,
[SPEAKER_00]: to examine the data and therefore just
rely on the stigma and myths or the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they heard growing up saying,
hey, marijuana is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they say, I don't want my kids to smoke
marijuana, so I can't support any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others use the excuse of kind of the cart
before the horse thing saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you know, I serve on the Financial
Services Committee, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I co-sponsored and supported pushing
through the Safe Banking Act to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that banks who are working with local
dispensaries or others within this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry are not living under the federal
shadow of potential prosecution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of my my colleagues on the
committee, I was surprised they were just
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, well, look, you know, even as they
advocate for states rights and respecting
[SPEAKER_00]: states rights, they say, well,
this is something that is still federally
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal, so we can't pass this bill
because it's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the states have done it,
there's not a whole lot of logic to the
[SPEAKER_00]: arguments that are being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, I really believe in order
for us to bring about the kind of change
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to pass legislation like the one
I've introduced, the only bipartisan bill
[SPEAKER_00]: in Congress to end the federal cannabis
prohibition, it's going to require
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents, residents, citizens of this
country, you know, call and call and
[SPEAKER_00]: endlessly tweeting, emailing, dropping by
mounting this pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will force leaders in Congress to
catch up with the rest of the country's at
[SPEAKER_01]: given that 91 percent support and we still
have trouble moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything that's incremental and
bipartisan and realistic that we can do in
[SPEAKER_01]: this Congress or next year's Congress,
given everything else that's going on in
[SPEAKER_01]: the country?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just going to happen at the state
state level?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we're seeing is it's already
happening at the state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the financial industry is now
paying more attention to the opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: that exist within the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's another pressure point
that can help influence members of
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress to recognize if nothing else,
there's a strong economic argument to be
[SPEAKER_00]: made here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as an incremental approach,
you know, we have a number of bills in
[SPEAKER_00]: place that try to chip away at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, you would think as much as
our country supports veterans,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that would be kind of an easy win,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A low hanging fruit to be able to say our
veterans are coming home dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic pain, many of them are traumatic
brain injury, post-traumatic stress,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't want to just numb that pain
away by taking these highly addictive
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids and they want to be able to have
access to medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's let our VA docs prescribe that or
even refer them to someone locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even that is not something that this
Congress, this highly partisan environment
[SPEAKER_00]: in Congress has been willing to get done
and to put on the president's desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think potentially the strongest argument
that could be made where there could be an
[SPEAKER_00]: incremental approach is around medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is undeniable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are so many examples of how
medical cannabis has saved people's lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a little bit of progress made
around the story of Charlotte and how her
[SPEAKER_00]: parents and those like them found the only
relief for their children in their
[SPEAKER_00]: epileptic seizures through the use of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot more that we can
do on that to say, if nothing else,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's begin with a national
decriminalization, legalization of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about states leading the
charge, I see Hawaii is implementing
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's continued drive to bring adult use
cannabis to Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you foresee happening in your home
state?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Hawaii, unfortunately,
we've been on the cutting edge of a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I'm really proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this area, it's it's disheartening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really there's there's a bit of a
generational difference, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some ways, even though we're a strong
Democratic state, the representatives and
[SPEAKER_00]: senators are pretty diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really disheartened when even as
both our state house and state Senate
[SPEAKER_00]: passed legislation, I think it was last
year or the year before that said if
[SPEAKER_00]: opioid addiction qualifies under our
medical cannabis access laws, it was it
[SPEAKER_00]: had bipartisan support.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our governor vetoed it, citing two
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, he says there's just not
enough evidence and data to show that
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis will help people who are
struggling with opioid addiction,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy because we've seen how in
states where people have that option to
[SPEAKER_00]: use medical cannabis, the numbers of
opioid addiction and opioid related deaths
[SPEAKER_00]: have decreased dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second reason he cited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, if they want to if they
want to include this, then they can go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the bureaucracy of the medical
review board and so on and so on,
[SPEAKER_00]: who we already know is opposed to this and
will have a predetermined outcome just
[SPEAKER_00]: shows the work that still needs to be done
even in my home state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am counting my voice among many to
be able to push this forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it has to do directly with adult
use, with opening up medical cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the different needs that people
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also is impacting the hemp industry
that I think has so much potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in my home state of Hawaii,
where you can farm 365 days a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to completely destroy a whole
crop of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was grown at the University of
Hawaii to begin this pilot project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it had some minute fraction of too
much THC in that hemp and they had to
[SPEAKER_00]: completely destroy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just it doesn't make any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Citizens often feel bewildered and
powerless when it comes to affecting this
[SPEAKER_01]: national change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sure you've seen how citizens
every day can affect their environment in
[SPEAKER_01]: their local cities and counties,
whether it was in the city of Honolulu all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way through their regions and their
state legislators office in 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the the checklist as a citizen for
engagement and pushing on these issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like it starts with being
registered to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Registering others to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you tell people to make them feel
empowered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Registering to vote and making sure that
your vote, your voice is heard through
[SPEAKER_00]: your vote at every level of government is
essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to do at least a little bit of
research before you go in and cast your
[SPEAKER_00]: vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask your your elected leaders questions
and share information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think the biggest hurdle here is
overcoming this gap in lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And demystifying the myths and stigmas
that still surround cannabis and really
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about the real life examples of how
this has has created a lot of opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: or personally impacted someone's health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or really, it comes down to the question
of liberty and freedom that every one of
[SPEAKER_00]: us should have the freedom to be able to
choose what we put in our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so making sure that that your voice is
heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only through the ballot box,
but actively engaging with your elected
[SPEAKER_00]: leaders and others in your community is
what I think will have the most the most
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've got to do it at every
level of government.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do get those emails from your readers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are your constituents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get those physical printed letters?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do you get those meetings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have they moved the needle for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have personal stories that have
changed your votes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not not related to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have had other situations
where there was a bill that was coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: the House floor, for example, that had to
do with privacy online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something that as we were heading
quickly to the vote, I think the day
[SPEAKER_00]: before it had large bipartisan support.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were things, though, in that bill
that would have had unintended negative
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences on our own civil liberties
and privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw in real time how in my office,
phones are ringing off the hook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emails were coming in like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitter was blowing up with people saying,
don't support this bill because X,
[SPEAKER_00]: Y and Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will have a negative impact on our own
civil liberties as it pertains to our
[SPEAKER_00]: online engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within a span of hours, on that day
that the vote was being had on the House
[SPEAKER_00]: floor, it went from a bill that had
overwhelming bipartisan support to having
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelming bipartisan opposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bill died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this doesn't happen every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it illustrates the power of of
the people in this country that that that
[SPEAKER_00]: really too often isn't recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people rightly so they feel frustrated
because they feel like their voices aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: being heard in a lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is one of, I think, a few
examples that shows, hey, when we all
[SPEAKER_00]: stand up and use every platform possible
to make sure that our voices are heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on how your elected leader
responds is how we as voters can hold them
[SPEAKER_00]: accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still have the power to hire and fire
people if they're not doing their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, Leafly, the app that I work at,
our news organization, is releasing a jobs
[SPEAKER_01]: count this morning that finds that in
2020, about 240,000 Americans are employed
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cannabis industry, you know,
comprising billions and billions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars of economic activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like the level of institutional
advocacy for cannabis might be higher than
[SPEAKER_01]: it's ever been in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of industry leaders in
the audience who've been battered by high
[SPEAKER_01]: taxes and regulations and ongoing
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them must be wondering if the
message is getting through to Capitol
[SPEAKER_01]: Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my last question is, are you seeing
that lobby being blitzed, are you seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: the advocacy show up like never before on
Capitol Hill?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these K-Street dollars being well
spent in terms of the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to, you know, participate and get
its voice heard?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's too early to tell,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I'd have to go back and look
at the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we passed the Safe Banking Act as
one example on the House floor,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see anywhere near the kind of
bipartisan support that I felt it should
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's still a lot more that
needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how much is being put into
this from an industry perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: but bluntly, there are still some high
hurdles to cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's so important that we don't
allow this issue to become caught up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the hyper-partisan environment in
Washington, where, yeah, sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: now in the House, Democrats have the
majority where we can pass legislation,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the Safe Banking Act, almost with
full Democrat support, with no or very few
[SPEAKER_00]: Republicans on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's going to the Senate,
where it's sitting there, like many other
[SPEAKER_00]: bills, just waiting for a vote that may or
may not come about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think on a bright note, an area where we
can look to how this has worked has been
[SPEAKER_00]: around the successful inclusion of hemp in
the last farm bill that was passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that saw a lot of opposition,
even for Mitch McConnell, for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know how powerful the hemp industry
that's growing in his home state had a
[SPEAKER_00]: direct impact on him in being the one to
make sure that the provision that we
[SPEAKER_00]: worked to include in the House stayed in
that Senate version that was finally
[SPEAKER_00]: signed into law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Representative Gabbard, thank you so much
for standing up and leading Americans and
[SPEAKER_01]: enduring that criticism of doing so and
participating in this wonderful experiment
[SPEAKER_01]: in self-government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to speak to you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a wonderful conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aloha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
