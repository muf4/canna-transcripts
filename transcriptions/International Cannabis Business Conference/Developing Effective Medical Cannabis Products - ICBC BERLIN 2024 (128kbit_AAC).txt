[SPEAKER_07]: International Cannabis Business Conference
2024 Berlin, brought to you by the Tallman
[SPEAKER_07]: Group and various other people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're good to be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to discuss developing
effective medical cannabis products,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is always good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, the later part of the day is
the medical part of the day, which is
[SPEAKER_07]: good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you can't.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: To lead us, the CEO and founder of Keen
Lock Natural Tools, LTD.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, he's very good at opening water
bottles, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's very dexterous.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you carry them all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for Dwayne Stewart.
I
[SPEAKER_07]: got one for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're good?
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's good?
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon, Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having us here today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations on your
quasi-legalization, not-legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a bumpy ride for you all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming from Canada, we've watched the
industry explode and implode and come back
[SPEAKER_06]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to talk a little bit today
about the foundation of a cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: release, which I think is medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the medical products that
we're going to talk about today are a big
[SPEAKER_06]: part of what has driven the history of the
prohibition of cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_06]: re-emergence over the years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my name is Dwayne, and we run a company
that does terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keen Lock Naturals.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also focus on medical products
through our wellness brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in 2022, we won the World CBD Awards
for the best CBD edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did that because we wanted to put
up our products against the world and made
[SPEAKER_06]: sure they were good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here at ICBC, I'm excited to announce
that we just completed a landmark
[SPEAKER_06]: observational study with Zentrila
showcasing the difference between our
[SPEAKER_06]: product, a CBD gummy with 50 milligrams of
CBD in it, versus a capsule.
[SPEAKER_06]: With 50 milligrams of CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we found that we had over 300% more
efficacy and over 500% more efficacy with
[SPEAKER_06]: women.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's those kinds of studies that have
driven the interest in this panel here
[SPEAKER_06]: today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want to talk a little bit about
where we've come from, why we do it,
[SPEAKER_06]: and what everything's all about.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to the panel members, take a moment and
introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And tell me, what is the thing that you go
to to munch on when you consume?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you consume?
[SPEAKER_03]: When I ever consumed?
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, I have a munch on chocolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a known thing for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They always say it's something for women.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in your study, the difference between
male and female that sometimes fades,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially with me, when it's about
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Charlie, you've been in the industry
forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us what you do at Bedrican.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us what you do at Bedrican.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we actually do is making basically a
raw pharmaceutical material.
[SPEAKER_03]: In very distinct five distinct varieties
that are genetically stable, that are
[SPEAKER_03]: chemically stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can be used to make products out
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't do that ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: We cooperate with industry partners here
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a strict pharmaceutical focus
in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where we are coming from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we have been doing for now,
almost 20 years in this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when did you start at Cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: 32 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: 32 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: The real pioneer here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make sure everybody knows that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Michael, how are you today?
[SPEAKER_06]: What need did you first see in the
marketplace that inspired you to do what
[SPEAKER_06]: you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't hold a candle to that to 32
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in Cannabis for only about six
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in senior government for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably should have used more
Cannabis then when I was in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: My company Remitos in Canada, we make the
equivalent to an asthma inhaler.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I saw was a need for a device
that was not only accurate, but acted
[SPEAKER_04]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has purified THC, or we can
customize the product in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it works really, really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: The challenge with it is fitting that
niche that we saw of having something that
[SPEAKER_04]: could work really quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gold standard being smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also have an accurate dosing,
which people want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's your go-to munchie?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your go-to munchie when you
consume?
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's got to get the munchies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of sleep through those,
I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use the knife.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin, from Abstract, how are you doing
today?
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw the booth.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys looked active.
[SPEAKER_06]: It smelled great.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the better smelling booths.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what role do you think technology plays
in differentiating product offerings in
[SPEAKER_06]: such a competitive cannabis market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to tip my hat to Marcus.
[SPEAKER_02]: He kind of did a good bang up job for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we invested heavily into analytics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what Marcus was showing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to invest in analytics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came out to be like 100 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do the 1,000 times more powerful than
your regular QC instrumentation that you
[SPEAKER_02]: see in the states today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that enables us to do discovery into
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that enables us to see 500 different
compounds in each sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we do that discovery,
it enables us to answer a lot of questions
[SPEAKER_02]: like, what happens when it sits on the
shelf?
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes cannabis gassy?
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes it exotic?
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we answer those questions,
we're able to create IP.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by extension, it enables us to be an R
&D partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And an innovation partner to our
customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that enables us to, in turn,
make better products.
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you find the terpenes are playing a
driving role, even in products that are
[SPEAKER_06]: meant to be single cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the terpenes is kind of like a
colloquial term, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, once you dig in there,
it's a lot more than just terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got the thiols, and the indols,
and the esters, and everything else under
[SPEAKER_02]: the sun in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's just a term to describe
the experience, the flavor and aroma of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what do you taste when you are
experiencing that product?
[SPEAKER_05]: Brenda, at the end there, how are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's always good to be at the
tail end and wake everybody up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's everyone feeling?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good?
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brenda, you guys are very
research-focused.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your company produces a CBD for inputs
around the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us a little bit more about the
clinical trials that you do as a
[SPEAKER_06]: prerequisite to product release.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that an important part of the
development?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you've got to think about the
pathway of the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a prerequisite for all products,
clinical trials?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, because you have a pathway of medical
products that don't need clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are limitations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're looking at dosing levels and
giving confidence to physicians,
[SPEAKER_05]: you do need the clinical backing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to go through a clinical
program, you do have to have clinical
[SPEAKER_05]: background.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're looking at acute pain versus
chronic pain, faster onset versus slow
[SPEAKER_05]: set.
[SPEAKER_05]: So depending on the product form,
depending on medical versus pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_05]: drug, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the medical pathway, no, you don't need
clinical trials for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want RS drugs, if you want more
champions in the medical community,
[SPEAKER_05]: GPs, pharmaceutical industry to get
involved, then yes, it is paramount and
[SPEAKER_05]: important to have clinical backing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you think that observational
studies have a place in that process?
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they have to carry enough weight
behind them for the pharmaceutical and
[SPEAKER_06]: medical market versus pure clinical phase
one, phase two trials?
[SPEAKER_05]: If we want to attract the pharmaceutical
industry, then we've got to do the full
[SPEAKER_05]: gamut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think sometimes within this
industry, I think there's some myths and
[SPEAKER_05]: false assumptions that just because it's a
natural plant-based substance,
[SPEAKER_05]: that regulators are going to take a bit of
a break or a faster pathway.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not true because, you know,
if you want to follow the biotech and
[SPEAKER_05]: pharma pathways, it's written in law and
regulation, and you have to do the full
[SPEAKER_05]: gamut to get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I won't jump in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally agree with what you say.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I do think cannabis is a very
specific product, and it's a natural
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody's talking about cannabinoids
as being the main component, and that
[SPEAKER_03]: needs to be researched properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that doctors and scientists are
doing that quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, however, that the value lies in
the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the value lies in
sterilization of a whole plant have
[SPEAKER_03]: specific, very specific chemical varieties
that you can actually research,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that is consistent for the next time
when the researcher comes back and has to
[SPEAKER_03]: do other research but with the same
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So making that possible and working
towards products in the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_03]: industry they have to take one hoop,
meaning they have to go off the
[SPEAKER_03]: single-compound theory, single-target
single-compound theory, and they have to
[SPEAKER_03]: accept a whole plant, but a standardized
whole plant, as a way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if we can achieve that,
then cannabis will get to the right place
[SPEAKER_03]: where it belongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is not only THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it was that, then products would
already have been long into the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the research should focus on whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: plant product to my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's many pathways, and I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabinoid research and isolating is just
a pathway we've chosen to get there,
[SPEAKER_05]: and following what regulators want to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at the market authorization
drugs, it's all from isolated products.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I agree, this is what needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_05]: More innovation, the more we study the
whole plant, the more products will be out
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the pathway that we've chosen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing watching the cannabis pioneer
fight the political activists at the end
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: An activist, you've got a lot of politics
in your background.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting your comment about if we
want to attract pharma.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we want to attract patients?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's part of the challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we look at the world of patients,
I think currently, if you see at a global
[SPEAKER_03]: level, it's about 10% of the doctors that
are willing to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_03]: 90% is not yet there and needs clinical
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree, we need to do clinical research
on every level.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that 90% of people that we cannot
reach, that can profit from cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine, that is the 90% you have to
reach through a pharmaceutical approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't agree more to that than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a good segue into safety.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk a little bit about safety.
[SPEAKER_06]: What role does safety and quality control
play in the product development that your
[SPEAKER_06]: company does?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you support safety?
[SPEAKER_06]: Mike, we'll start with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: A product like ours, Wayne, the QA and the
QC on it, it's built like a drug product.
[SPEAKER_04]: We follow the international ICH guidelines
for how you'd make a medical device like
[SPEAKER_04]: an inhaler.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tested all the way through front and
back end.
[SPEAKER_04]: We make the product to GMP criteria simply
because it's going to evolve that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though in Canada, the way the
licensing works is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Globally, it's going to be a GMP product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just had a great talk earlier on the
confusion of how every country sets up
[SPEAKER_04]: their own rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: The closer we can get to those standards,
those GMP standards, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: easier for everybody to understand the
product and for it to move around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone said something earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you enter the industry or when the
industry starts up, the barriers to entry
[SPEAKER_02]: are usually lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it progresses and matures, those
barriers get much higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: In California, QA and QC are huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things are starting to be adapted.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already adapted by a majority of
the Canadian LPs and the US companies are
[SPEAKER_02]: catching up to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Further on that, you have the regulatory
packets that you have to be completely
[SPEAKER_02]: ready for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you know all about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, toxicology is a big one that's
getting a whole lot of investment now.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start off in the industry,
ISO might cut it, but not anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to go to SQF 1, 2, 3,
GMP, and you have to go through the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: gamut now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brenda?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think safety is paramount to give
consumers, patients confidence that the
[SPEAKER_05]: products they're consuming are safe and
reliable.
[SPEAKER_05]: The stigma still exists in this industry,
as we all know.
[SPEAKER_05]: The industry hasn't helped itself where
they put products out there that has a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of banned substance in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The approach we've taken to assistive
safety, I think it starts with your
[SPEAKER_05]: manufacturing has been mentioned,
your toxicology, and also the safety
[SPEAKER_05]: profiles are two things that were
paramount when we look at novel foods in
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe that they want to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that we've done as a
company to your question, Dwayne,
[SPEAKER_05]: was we provided our own data when we did
our applications rather than relying on
[SPEAKER_05]: third-party data.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the data in our submissions is from
our own manufacturing, our own molecules
[SPEAKER_05]: to put that forward in our facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that is paramount if we want to
build confidence amongst consumers and
[SPEAKER_05]: patients and attract more people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bedrocken was the first company that
became GMP licensed back in very early
[SPEAKER_03]: 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that GMP should go to the level of
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where it all starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the Dutch government went with
us in the beginning saying, we include
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation the way you do it as part of
your GMP license.
[SPEAKER_03]: Later on they said, difficult,
cannot be.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be GACP anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, what we have been doing as a
company is we implemented GMP in our GACP
[SPEAKER_03]: manuals and made it GMCCP as we call it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're making up your own acronyms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: At Flow Scientific, our terpene company,
we constantly are being asked to include
[SPEAKER_06]: new molecules in different formulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: We revert to the best available safety
data and provide or don't provide them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we get complaints, your product is
more expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're like, yes, it's not being cut with
questionable products, which we've seen
[SPEAKER_06]: from some providers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Often it's the effect of the marketplace,
especially on the rec side, that'll use,
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to push the boundaries and gain
market share.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the medical side, fortunately,
I don't see that happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that rec pushes medical?
[SPEAKER_03]: The other way around, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bit of a shame to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that rec should be rec and
medical should be medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: The overlap between the two, it's a little
bit heartbreaking, especially when I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to convince doctors.
[SPEAKER_03]: We as a company are trying to convince
doctors that you can use cannabis the
[SPEAKER_03]: right way for patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the doctor is pointing to the medical
world or to the recreational world and
[SPEAKER_03]: say, look what's happening there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are looking to what is happening in
Germany right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some sort of a gray overlap
between medical and recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doctors, they shift away from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to be there and they don't
want to be mentioned that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I think it's fair enough to say,
recreational world, create your own world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fine with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem on that side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't mingle with the world of patients to
that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is too big group that has is in need
of cannabis for many ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell Health Canada that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the medical and rec are very
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: From my experience in Canada, when rec
came in, we had hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_04]: patients with medical documents and it
plummeted.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we see is, when I used to be involved
in executive side in healthcare,
[SPEAKER_04]: until you convince the person that holds
the pen, that's writing the script,
[SPEAKER_04]: you need to have the quality to tie all
this together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Between the QC, the QA, the label.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't talk about the label.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the medical side, the label is so
important because when a doctor writes a
[SPEAKER_04]: script, they don't question the label.
[SPEAKER_04]: They assume it's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They live in a world where if the cancer
drug says X, they assume that's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get to that standard on the
medical side.
[SPEAKER_04]: The clinical and observational,
you asked a question on, I think
[SPEAKER_04]: observational work is so important and we
have such an interesting opportunity
[SPEAKER_04]: because cannabis itself has notice of
compliance, to use a pharma term.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the industry in Canada,
several places in the United States and
[SPEAKER_04]: now coming into Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do observational work that you
can't do with an API in the drug side
[SPEAKER_04]: where you have to go through quality,
safety, firm talks and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll come down to how smart we can be in
this room about asking the right questions
[SPEAKER_04]: on the observational work, convincing the
white coats in our world, this does work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're almost there.
[SPEAKER_04]: REC is going to create amazing
opportunities and amazing challenges at
[SPEAKER_04]: the same time because our physicians will,
Michael, go across the street and just go
[SPEAKER_04]: pick it out yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to carry the liability.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to learn a lot as we
go rapidly through this from
[SPEAKER_04]: decriminalizing and bringing in this
amazing oil that can help so many people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bridger, I didn't want to forget to have
you pitch your keynote tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you going to be talking about
tomorrow morning?
[SPEAKER_05]: Tomorrow morning we'll be talking about
advancing the cannabinoid scientific
[SPEAKER_05]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the challenges?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the course?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the rewards?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's on the horizon in terms of
innovation that's happening within the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been told by the organizers it's
going to be the highlight of the
[SPEAKER_05]: conference, so it's a must attend,
10 a.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: You brought your own fluffers,
did you?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just passing on information I've been
told, Dwight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking the truth at the end of the panel
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin, terpenes and flavors and esters and
ethols, as you pointed out, are always
[SPEAKER_06]: making waves in product development in
North America.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm certainly seeing that in Canada as
being one of the key differentiators of
[SPEAKER_06]: how products are made to appear different
from their competitive products.
[SPEAKER_06]: What future trends do you foresee in
cannabis product design over the next few
[SPEAKER_06]: years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically in Germany, we'll see how the
medical market develops here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm specifically very interested in seeing
how that develops and how the recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: market develops and if there is going to
be a divergent between the medical and the
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational or if it's just going to gray
together essentially into people releasing
[SPEAKER_02]: the same product in both markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we see in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see every product under the sun is
what it seems like when you walk into a
[SPEAKER_02]: California dispenser.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if that's the same thing
that's going to happen here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of speculation in that
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems in phase one that we're not going
to even see the ability to sell or buy
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be phase two or pillar
two, as I've heard this weekend.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Canada, we've certainly blended that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your comment, Michael, about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just go across the street and pick
it out yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: The challenge with that process,
at least in Canada, has been that the
[SPEAKER_06]: arbiter of what's available in rec is
individual people that are part of the
[SPEAKER_06]: monopolies that actually control
distribution, meaning the provincial
[SPEAKER_06]: governments.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that doesn't happen here for
Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be the main thing I'd recommend
they do not do.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as the ability for medical to
access greater product selection that are
[SPEAKER_06]: actually effective, I think medical does a
better job of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to have the opportunity to
produce products that hit a very specific
[SPEAKER_06]: outcome, whether it's in female health,
whether it's in relaxation stress or pain
[SPEAKER_06]: control.
[SPEAKER_06]: Charlie, how do you think that's going to
be unfolded here in Germany?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very difficult to predict how things
are going to look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I do know, however, is that if people
want to use cannabis for a specific
[SPEAKER_03]: purpose in their health, most of those
people like to stick to the brand or to
[SPEAKER_03]: the product that they get.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a problem in recreational type of
production, especially when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or flour product, that it will be
difficult to maintain those products for a
[SPEAKER_03]: longer time in the market, because they
will be replaced by other types and other
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it will be difficult for that
specific group to find and to stick to a
[SPEAKER_03]: product that is always there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, when you start working product
into other products, it might become a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit better.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, flour is still one of the
biggest products in the market and is
[SPEAKER_03]: there to stay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even in Canada with a wide selection of
product formats, edibles, topicals,
[SPEAKER_06]: vapes, et cetera, flour is still 70% of
the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then pre-rolls are another 20% of the
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's 10 or 15% of the market that's
being used by non-flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm putting pre-roll into that flour
category.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that you've done over
the years, Charlie, is if you've had to
[SPEAKER_06]: move your business around to support
regulatory changes, how do regulations
[SPEAKER_06]: affect where you operate?
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulatory compliance is actually one of
the first commitments we have in our
[SPEAKER_03]: company.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been bound to the Netherlands for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the rules were changing in Canada,
we have been there for a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we saw the mix of recreational
and medical arise again in Canada,
[SPEAKER_03]: things started to become difficult for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Europe, we see a change now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are more countries coming online
with regulatory-friendly environments for
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's the reason why we are
moving to Denmark as we speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plans are moving this month, so we hope to
be online in Denmark by the end of this
[SPEAKER_03]: year and to have more regulatory freedom,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see it's a patchwork in Europe still of
regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to adapt to that patchwork,
kind of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, with medical marketing in
Germany really being driven by the
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmacy distribution and that really
impacting the product designs that we can
[SPEAKER_06]: put into the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Michael, how has that really impacted your
product design concepts?
[SPEAKER_04]: A product like ours will be a medical
device, as I understand it, in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be treated like a drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Countries in Europe, Portugal,
United Kingdom are a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's regulations around cannabis
medicine or integrated devices.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think as it harmonizes, it will come
together and it will be a GMP-level
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the comments that were just made on the
quality assurance and the label,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going to be critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the regulatory aspect of a product
like ours, it's going to be highly
[SPEAKER_04]: regulated simply because it's a device and
then the quality of the API that goes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany's got a really great opportunity
here from watching and learning from
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada and the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the regulations will probably be
great on the QA, QC side.
[SPEAKER_04]: The quality of the product will be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be access to market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany likes its rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the quality of the product is
going to be very high.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to see 60, 70 percent flower
as it evolves and then there's going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: other products come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you see the regulation on the screen
where the flower could only have 10
[SPEAKER_06]: percent THC?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that an age gate thing or was that
meant to be across the board?
[SPEAKER_06]: Age?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: 27 percent cannabis in Canada is like,
oh, is it that low?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's going to happen here.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the medical side, as we develop
products for medical, how do you find your
[SPEAKER_06]: motivation and the reward and results of
focusing on medical versus rec?
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that impact your products?
[SPEAKER_06]: And, Brenda, maybe we'll start with you on
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're focused on the medical
pharmaceutical side and don't do anything
[SPEAKER_05]: on the rec side, but we're guided by the
evidence and the science.
[SPEAKER_05]: We look at cannabinoids and see how they
work in the body, how they work with the
[SPEAKER_05]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_05]: We follow the science.
[SPEAKER_05]: We work with researchers around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, we're in 30 clinical studies
globally that are utilizing our active
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmaceutical ingredients.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're guided by the evidence.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're guided by the science.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're guided by what the researchers like
the Welsh paper say on what these
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids can do, and we feel it's
important to isolate them, to study them,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then figure out how they work
individually and how they work in
[SPEAKER_05]: combination, and then put that through
clinical research.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're developing new chemical entities
also doing our research, but we're driven
[SPEAKER_05]: by the science.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're driven by the data in terms of our
approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Driven by science, we just opened up our
own clinical research unit in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Netherlands, getting to a level of
scientific results that we are aiming for
[SPEAKER_03]: with our own products, with our own flour,
basically, and getting those results out
[SPEAKER_03]: there, basically getting the thumbs up
from the medical world on the way we
[SPEAKER_03]: approach it is for us very rewarding.
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to the science part of it,
I've learned so much from the sales data
[SPEAKER_04]: on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got into this thinking naively that an
inhaler like we were making would be great
[SPEAKER_04]: for people that are naive to cannabis,
and what the sales data is showing us in
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada is people that smoke a lot of
cannabis are picking up an inhaler,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're doing it because of
anti-smoking laws that are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people that consume medical cannabis
globally are smoking it because that's the
[SPEAKER_04]: primary format that we've had for years
and years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think as it evolves, it's gonna be a
very interesting product to see how people
[SPEAKER_04]: evolve and continue to smoke because
that's the way they've taken it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know in medical systems, when you ask a
patient to stop smoking, they don't,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm not trying to shame anybody about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the way they consume their medicine,
and we're gonna see better products come
[SPEAKER_04]: along to help them keep their THC levels
appropriate and manage their indication.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kevin, do you find that your clients are
coming to you with consumer-based demand?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you seeing that the demand for product
development come from the level of the
[SPEAKER_06]: consumer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, more or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting how you said how you're
following the science, and it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: objective, whereas when we're developing
products for consumer-focused,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're developing it for our clients,
we're just doing it for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our science is a bit squishier as it
depends on the consumer's experience,
[SPEAKER_02]: and my experience of cherries is morally
different than your experience of
[SPEAKER_02]: cherries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we analyze something,
we analyze it to the nth degree,
[SPEAKER_02]: all as many compounds we possibly can,
and then we take this huge sensory panel
[SPEAKER_02]: of many people to say, how does that smell
and taste to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that experience to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then trying to combine these databases
together to create this robot that can
[SPEAKER_02]: predict how something might be later,
and we're using that to develop these
[SPEAKER_02]: products at a larger scale for more
people, essentially, to make more custom
[SPEAKER_02]: products for these consumers in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_06]: We certainly experience the Kinloch
Wellness consumers coming to us and
[SPEAKER_06]: expressing joy with a given product,
and that really helps us direct where
[SPEAKER_06]: we're gonna go next, and certainly the
sales data is a big indicator of that,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we've had products that have failed,
products that we think they're great,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the consumer's like, meh, and in a
busy marketplace, meh, doesn't cut it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gotta be spectacular one way or the
other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just quickly add, too, on that
thing, I think, think about products,
[SPEAKER_05]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta think about innovation,
too, in terms of advanced delivery
[SPEAKER_05]: systems, finished usage forms,
how we're enhancing buy availability,
[SPEAKER_05]: solubility, the stability on this product,
and viability's a key one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that is gonna be key,
too, and I think targeted delivery systems
[SPEAKER_05]: is also gonna be key, too, as we move,
so innovation's also gonna push,
[SPEAKER_05]: too, in terms of developing products.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's time for questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who has a question?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, there's one right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was gonna say you were wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is clearly not time for questions,
and yet you were right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was watching the clock, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm doing my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: We come from Morocco, and we are new to
the medical legalization of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we see is this, the medical
position is to go to the molecule while
[SPEAKER_00]: the world is looking for the flower,
and we just don't understand this
[SPEAKER_00]: schizophrenia between the consumer that
came to cannabis and heard about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and 1,000 years of reputation,
and medicine is coming to it because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower, and now we are breaking it to
molecules, and we just don't know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: navigate to this because we are going to
extraction, and the further we go into
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction and the further we go from the
origin, and we don't know whether it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule or it's the full spectrum that is
needed, and in that case, if it's the full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum, why an oil full spectrum
wouldn't be a medicine and why a flower
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't be a medicine, and since we are
investing, every day, it's getting foggier
[SPEAKER_00]: and foggier, so welcome to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more we study, the less we understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to cannabis or is that welcome to
corporate science?
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the regulation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may, what actually happened to
cannabis in general, people found out that
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis has its medical value,
and then all of a sudden, we have to push
[SPEAKER_03]: it into a system that we call medicines,
and people don't understand it,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we had lots of discussions in our
company as well where we actually say the
[SPEAKER_03]: horse has always been behind the cart.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to do your research first before
you bring a pharmaceutical product to the
[SPEAKER_03]: market, and guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is there for 60, 70, 80,
100 years, thousands years already in a
[SPEAKER_03]: market where it's basically a traditional
medicine to that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there's a very important thing to
cannabis because cannabis is not cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: always the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have those different products with
different molecules, and then we're coming
[SPEAKER_03]: to the terpenes, to the cannabinoids,
to everything together there, so the
[SPEAKER_03]: option of picking out one molecule is for
a doctor and a pharmacist the most ideal
[SPEAKER_03]: option.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for them the best way to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, history has shown that whole
plant, in many cases, works better,
[SPEAKER_03]: but not this specific whole plant,
but that whole plant, so what makes that
[SPEAKER_03]: difference?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where standardization,
the chemical standardization of your plant
[SPEAKER_03]: matter comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm starting to lecture now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand your question, but there's
basically no real answer to it other than
[SPEAKER_03]: look into history, what happened there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brenda?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I think it's an ongoing debate,
and we hear this all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there are many pathways,
and I think there's no right answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want a pharmaceutical drug out
there, there's a pathway to establish what
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to do and isolate molecules,
and if you look at the approved market
[SPEAKER_05]: authorized drugs, it's all dealing with
molecules, but if you want a medical
[SPEAKER_05]: pathway, that's there too, and I don't
think there's a wrong answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just where your focus is and the
approach that you want to take.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think maybe some of the challenge,
though, that we see is that the scientific
[SPEAKER_07]: approach or the pharmaceutical approach
tends to overshadow, because there's more
[SPEAKER_07]: money, so it tends to overshadow,
and they try to push the plant magic out
[SPEAKER_07]: of the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the tension that built.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the reasons we did the study that
we just released yesterday to answer your
[SPEAKER_06]: question, sir, is that we believe that
broad spectrum is critically important,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we believe there's a larger market for
non-THC products.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of our products actually don't contain
any THC, but they do have CBG and CBN and
[SPEAKER_06]: CBC and CBD and terpenes, and what we were
able to show was that a CBD isolate
[SPEAKER_06]: molecule without the additional plant
components was not as effective.
[SPEAKER_06]: It still worked, but it wasn't as
effective, so I actually, you take a
[SPEAKER_06]: counterpoint that I actually don't think
the focus on the molecule by itself is the
[SPEAKER_06]: right path, as I think you're trying to
articulate, but it is, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_06]: a path that can be understood,
and Brenda, I think, would agree with me
[SPEAKER_06]: that if you can understand a thing,
you can regulate a thing better,
[SPEAKER_06]: and therefore, you can make it go forward,
but that isn't necessarily right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to follow up on the earlier
question and your great panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this question, belief versus proof,
as cannabis puts itself as a traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, but also very modern medical
product, what modern techniques are there
[SPEAKER_01]: to solve your problem of proving out the
efficacy that traditional medical trials
[SPEAKER_01]: can't do, and maybe more complicated
modern data analytics might be,
[SPEAKER_01]: so what techniques would you see in the
future?
[SPEAKER_06]: The specific technique that we use with a
company called Zentrella, I encourage you
[SPEAKER_06]: to look them up, is they used an AI-based
algorithm that was analyzing EEG data,
[SPEAKER_06]: so we actually put an EEG on people's
heads, have them consume the product,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then compare the results between their
pre-consumption state, their
[SPEAKER_06]: post-consumption state, and the states
that they achieve between the two products
[SPEAKER_06]: over two different sessions, and so that's
a good example of taking new technology as
[SPEAKER_06]: non-invasive and that can be observed,
it can be done fairly quickly,
[SPEAKER_06]: it can be done with some economic
viability, and it's a good use of
[SPEAKER_06]: artificial intelligence, and I know we had
a great AI chat just before this,
[SPEAKER_06]: but gentlemen, what else are you seeing
done as far as modern techniques to
[SPEAKER_06]: resolve that question?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're looking at the efficiency,
how you could do clinical processes more
[SPEAKER_05]: efficient, because right now, you're
looking at a billion dollars in 10 years
[SPEAKER_05]: to do a full trial, but how you can do
your in vivo, in vitro, and look at some
[SPEAKER_05]: of those signals there.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not getting a thing,
cut your losses and move on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the innovative ways that you can
go that work with CROs, we're working with
[SPEAKER_05]: IQVIA, and how we can do these more
efficiently to move ahead, but I think the
[SPEAKER_05]: key thing for us is that if you're not
getting the signals earlier, you got to go
[SPEAKER_05]: find a new direction and move on,
and then don't flog a dead horse.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing I've seen that I think
works well is joining together,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, cooperatives that have an
outcome that benefits everyone,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, you're seeing that a little bit
with the novel foods groups, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the novel foods people are getting
together to say, you want this data?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's all get the data.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be the same data,
and then get the regulator to try to
[SPEAKER_06]: approve that, but share the cost divided
by 30 instead of divided by one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's maybe not that innovative
an idea, but in a highly competitive
[SPEAKER_06]: environment, I think it's rare.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_06]: More questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're on time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: All done.
Thank you.
