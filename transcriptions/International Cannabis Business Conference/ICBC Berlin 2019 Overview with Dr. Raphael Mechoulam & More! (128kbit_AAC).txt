[SPEAKER_00]: I'm delighted that people from many
different aspects, working in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke to people from many different
countries, many of them grow the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: others try to formulate it, make it into
drugs, or make it into edibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I expect that all of them will have to
sit together and discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many problems that have to be
solved in the future, and such meetings
[SPEAKER_00]: like this one will help understand them,
and then cannabis will come into the
[SPEAKER_00]: market with a much better background and
understanding of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Sebastian from Greenception.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a German tech startup, and we claim
to have hacked the sun, so I can create
[SPEAKER_01]: sunsets, I can simulate daytime,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been to quite a lot of trade fairs,
conferences, et cetera, and I really think
[SPEAKER_01]: that was the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: The speakers or the topics that we were
selected with were very interesting and
[SPEAKER_01]: very well organized, so thank you,
guys.

all my languages and use my cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: skills to be a part of something that is
very magnificent.
