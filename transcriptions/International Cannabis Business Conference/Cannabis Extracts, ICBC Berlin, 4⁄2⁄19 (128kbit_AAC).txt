[SPEAKER_00]: While the panel is entering the stage,
I want to thank you for coming to our
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And may I introduce to you David Laroussa,
from sales director from Atex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have Vince, no, we have,
we have Zach from SOJ Companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have Pete Patterson from Vitalis
Extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Pete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, we have Mike
Maybach from Lab Society in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I introduce the panelists in
detail to you, I want to give a short
[SPEAKER_00]: overview of what we're going to talk about
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the panel before, you heard a lot about
extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard a lot about standardization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very specific problem here in
Germany, because the whole plant extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: did not reach our pharmacies yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have in the pharmacies is those,
we call it monosubstances, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: adrenabinol, which is a monosubstance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it was mentioned before,
we have Zativex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have just one whole plant extract,
which is very new in the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or no, it's two offered by a Canadian
importer, by a Canadian producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But except that, only private persons know
anything about extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the knowledge within the cannabis
industry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extraction knowledge is not very
widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, different from the US and from
Canada, it's on a very private level,
[SPEAKER_00]: which gives, which makes a big problem
when it comes to the medical use of
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of patients know better than their
doctors and know better than the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacists, because they know the
extracts from the private, from the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market or from extracting the medical weed
they get privately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people privately who do
make, for example, who extract their
[SPEAKER_00]: Betrocan cannabis, make a whole plant
extraction because this is not offered in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they only can get that strain,
that specific strain in the form of butts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you need an extraction,
you have to do it on a private level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very proud to present to you five
experts, four experts on extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of them are using a different approach
to extract medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a little sorry that I have to use
my crib, because I have two panels today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to introduce anybody as he deserves,
I do have to use my crib.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to start with David.
[SPEAKER_00]: And David Larosa is sales director at
APEC, super critical, a leading CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction manufacturer based in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave directs the sales team at APEX,
helps streamline and implement processes
[SPEAKER_00]: to help improve the customer's experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we talk in the green room before
the meeting here, before the panel,
[SPEAKER_00]: you cannot, you don't have products in
your state yet, but you're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on producing or on the technique
behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first question goes out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your company is specialized and focused on
developing super critical CO2 technology
[SPEAKER_00]: on industrial level.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, especially in Germany,
we're not so experienced with extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe give a short overview?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is CO2 extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it differ from the old ways of
extraction we know so far?
[SPEAKER_02]: So CO2 extraction is the extraction using
a CO2 solvent, taking CO2 from a gas to a
[SPEAKER_02]: liquid at high pressures, thus extracting
the oils, the waxes and the lipids,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then removing those from the actual
plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: At APEX, we focus on introductory systems,
but also scalable to industrial size.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with our systems, we actually operate
them on the same platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as customers scale their business and
grow their business, it's an easy
[SPEAKER_02]: transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: From going from an introductory system to
a medium system to the large system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a producer of extraction technology,
you have a bigger overview of what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did the demand for cannabis
extracts develop in the US and on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian market within the last years?
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously, it started off in the West.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the demand for cannabis and hemp,
Andy was approached by the select
[SPEAKER_02]: customers, and they wanted another method
of actually extracting through a cleaner,
[SPEAKER_02]: purer process, which would then ultimately
reduce the amount of post-processing time
[SPEAKER_02]: and refining it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to come back to what I said in the
beginning, this is also a technique you
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot use on private and small level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is very different from your
technology, Zach, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me introduce Zach first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zach is based in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's the VP of Rosin Tech Products,
a California based industry leading
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless extraction company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Solventless is just heat and pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do Rosin presses at Rosin Tech
Products, and you take your flour or your
[SPEAKER_05]: dry sift, your ice water hash,
and you are setting your temperature,
[SPEAKER_05]: your time, putting your material in a
filter bag within the parchment paper,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you're pressing for about 30 to
60 seconds, and you're getting your
[SPEAKER_05]: solventless hash oil, or your Rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the Rosin, it's full spectrum,
and it's just a matter of taking your
[SPEAKER_05]: material and then whether you're doing
CO2, or you're doing VHO, you're always
[SPEAKER_05]: using a solvent with solventless.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to worry about that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the medical demand,
here in Germany, this technique is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to medical production,
what about your home?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so with Rosin, it's very affordable.
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of extraction, it's very easy to
get started.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Germany actually is one of our largest
countries that we sell Rosin presses to.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of patients want to be able to make
their oil, and it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a Rosin press is pretty small,
so you can keep it on your counter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, Rosin started about 10
years ago, maybe even a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: People started with hair straighteners,
and now we've developed presses that are
[SPEAKER_05]: just a little bit more pressure,
but that allow you to get the oil with
[SPEAKER_05]: less time under the heat, which allows for
greater terpene retention.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with Rosin, you get a really tasty end
product that, with ice water hash,
[SPEAKER_05]: is some of the best oil out there on the
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ice water hash would be washing your
material, putting it in a freeze dryer,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then pressing it and getting your ice
water hash Rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and this is also a technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients can use on a very small scale,
can't they?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you can do, it's pretty much a
connoisseur product out there,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we do work with a lot of processors
all over the world who are attracted to
[SPEAKER_05]: the idea of doing solvent lists.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you go into a supermarket now
and you look at your shopping cart,
[SPEAKER_05]: everything's organic with solvent lists,
and consumers and patients are excited
[SPEAKER_05]: about the idea of having a clean,
tasty, terpy end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pete, it's great to have you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You founded Vitalis Extraction Technology
back in 2016, and before you have 15 years
[SPEAKER_00]: of experience in varying industries,
in legal retail, manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and healthcare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I did some research on your
homepage, I found the following.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before opening the doors on what would
become the leading manufacturer of an
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial size, super critical CO2
extraction systems, three partners went
[SPEAKER_00]: out to extract us and asked that very
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer took them on a two year journey
of research, ideation, and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: May I ask you to mention the cornerstones
of the answers you found?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this work?
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came out of the private equity side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we have anybody from the
finance world in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess everybody's interested in
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you're sitting here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a customer buying these systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to build just some big gigantic
machines is kind of the approach that we
[SPEAKER_01]: took.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we looked at the determining
factors for these systems, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of information that's out there with the
Apex systems and Eden and Precision and
[SPEAKER_01]: all sorts of different types of
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tried to say, okay, how can we
normalize that a little bit and make it a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more understandable?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at just the pillars of
extraction being temperature, pressure,
[SPEAKER_01]: and flow over a certain amount of time,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So temperature and pressures, you can vary
those depending on the type of output that
[SPEAKER_01]: you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then increasing or decreasing your
flow rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount of solvent that you're
adding to the equation to, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: get a different type of result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our talk track, our basis of
extraction, basis of research and design
[SPEAKER_01]: has been around temperature, pressure,
and flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to decrease the amount of
time that it takes to facilitate the
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your company announced a cooperation
with Hemp America CBD, a very big CBD oil
[SPEAKER_00]: producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And despite hemp farming in the USA is
more an exception than a rule,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can produce on a very large amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: How come?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Big flow, big systems, big vessels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are probably seeing it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine since the farm bill just
passed in December in the US, that has
[SPEAKER_01]: created a monster demand on the say CBD
extraction side of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're also seeing that across Europe
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD is becoming far more popularized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to happen in tandem when
cannabis or marijuana is being discussed
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of a sudden CBD is just is brought
up along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's been available for quite
a period of time, there's hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we've seen by a number of different
panelists, there's hundreds of products
[SPEAKER_01]: already in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really just when our customers
approach us, especially with these large
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp systems are looking for large volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking for just clean,
efficient extraction processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what's allowed us to
service that side of the market pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you describe the ratio between
CBD, the demand for CBD and THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: So your personal experience from a
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, I'd say 40% of my customer
base is extracting from hemp and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: buying the much larger systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we call it the R 200, which is a
hundred liter extraction vessel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them will stack, you know,
three or four or five of those side by
[SPEAKER_01]: side by side to be doing, you know,
a couple of a couple thousand kilos a day
[SPEAKER_01]: of hemp extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I come to our fourth expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is representing another technology,
another method to make extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael has graduated in environmental
chemistry and has served his passion for
[SPEAKER_00]: developing cannabis specific laboratory
equipment into a multimillion dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And congratulations for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And despite he's of quite young age,
he already founded a lot of companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the recent project is focusing on
short path distillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that differ from the
techniques we've had from so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: And may I ask you to explain that short
path distillation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So short path distillation really is
actually a method of refinement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it actually works really cohesively
with all of the extraction methods that
[SPEAKER_03]: we've discussed here today, as well as
other methods of solvent extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nice thing about distillation is that
you can essentially render any substance,
[SPEAKER_03]: any sort of extract solvent free in the
end, which is great, especially for large
[SPEAKER_03]: scale processing procedures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So through the distillation process,
we're using heat and vacuum, specifically
[SPEAKER_03]: deep vacuum to lower the boiling point of
cannabinoids since they're typically very
[SPEAKER_03]: viscous and very heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to boil them off, we lower our
boiling point using vacuum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from there, we can use fractional
columns or wiped film distillation stills
[SPEAKER_03]: on the continuous side, especially with,
like Pete was saying, with the farm bill,
[SPEAKER_03]: the scale has jumped tremendously.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started off with small units that were
doing, you know, a half kilo to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, our largest small scale system
does about 12 kilos per batch to a system
[SPEAKER_03]: that does 10 to 20 kilos per hour feed
rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously it's a substantial
difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from there, we're also looking to
scale from 50 to 200 kilos per hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about much larger
systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the true benefit to distillation is
the creation of a standardized product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So through product development,
you know, I believe in the last talk,
[SPEAKER_03]: they were mentioning that there's just so
many different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much that we need to know from
the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nice thing about distillation is that
we can render a cannabis extract that
[SPEAKER_03]: normally would have terpenes and all these
other things in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can render it as a sole cannabinoid
fraction, which will have all the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids present in the initial
strain, initial phenotype, typical
[SPEAKER_03]: expression of that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from there, we can reintroduce
terpenes and other flavonoids and other
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds to actually create an extract or
a medicine that is more directed towards a
[SPEAKER_03]: specific illness.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other great thing about distillation
is that you can work from a distillate
[SPEAKER_03]: into isolates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And using isolates, obviously there's some
bad connotation to that depending on who
[SPEAKER_03]: you're talking to on the medical side,
which I completely agree with.
[SPEAKER_03]: The entourage effect is definitively a
real thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the benefit of distillation is that
you can start with a very pure product
[SPEAKER_03]: prior to these processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What leads me to my next question,
because standardization is a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very important thing, as we heard before.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a German patient enters a pharmacy and
he wants to have an extract, he only gets
[SPEAKER_00]: to know the CBD and the THC content,
that's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your company able to produce a whole
spectrum profile?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't specifically produce the
products, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: We help manufacturers and consumers,
well, really end processors, produce
[SPEAKER_03]: products for end consumers that would have
a wide spectrum of different products.
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest issue right now, I think,
especially in America, is just the lack of
[SPEAKER_03]: standardization of process and the
analytical side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a company, we've kind of pivoted
towards analytics, standardization,
[SPEAKER_03]: processing, just really trying to dial in
our SOPs not only for the GNP side,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also for just the analytical side.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a wide spectrum of cannabinoids
that all should be recognized in
[SPEAKER_03]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only that, but the residual solvent,
the pesticide content, the heavy metal
[SPEAKER_03]: content, all these things are really
important for a patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you're going to say,
hey, this is a medicine, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: it better be treated as such.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the medical world, these things are
all extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave, let me ask you another question
about standardization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your state, you're coming from Ohio,
is just in the phases of regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just regulating the medical
cannabis market.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is standardization for your
company?
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is it for the authorities,
for the dialogue with our authorities?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one, from the APEC side, selling the
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure that we put the
equipment in the customer's hand,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're getting the right equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So understanding the standardization,
understanding the regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the states right now, because it's
federally illegal for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: but states are legalizing it, they're
making their own rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're kind of taking a shot at the dark
to find out, OK, what rules can we follow?
[SPEAKER_02]: What rules do we have to abide by?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea of a standardization process
will help us provide the right equipment
[SPEAKER_02]: to the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what would you say if you look at the
German regulation system and compare it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the American to the US regulation system?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Germany, we have good standardization,
but we don't have any products.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the US, the standardization is not
perfect, but you have products.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is better in the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the standardization,
first and foremost, then this way we can
[SPEAKER_02]: follow the regulations, and then this way
it's consistent across the board versus
[SPEAKER_02]: having variables in different regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may add to that, being in Canada,
we've seen a little bit of a mix between
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening in the European market as
this market evolves, and then seeing on
[SPEAKER_01]: the US side of things where you really,
state by state by state, it's opening up.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we approach this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What levels of standardization must be
reached?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in Canada, because the Canadian
market really wants to reach into Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: and start to sell there, we've seen kind
of a little bit of a hybrid model.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you every single time I come
over to Europe, I'm always impressed with
[SPEAKER_01]: the people that I sit down, the customers
that we're chatting with and discussing
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a cowboy approach by any means of
bringing pharmaceutical experience to the
[SPEAKER_01]: table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're asking questions about GMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're asking questions about equipment
certification with PED.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're asking stuff about IQ and OQ and
PQ, so installation qualifications,
[SPEAKER_01]: operational qualifications, performance
qualifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And making sure that their equipment's
gonna pass the stages or the
[SPEAKER_01]: standardizations that your German auditors
are gonna require to not only make that
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, but to operate the equipment
that's going to make that medicine at a
[SPEAKER_01]: standard level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding what's the requirement to
the European side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, the Europeans, and some of the
Canadians in the room and US in the room,
[SPEAKER_01]: but really the Europeans are stepping up
that level of, say, manufacturing and that
[SPEAKER_01]: level of compliance that the globe is now
looking to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really impressive to see what's
going on over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next question goes out to an expert on
the Canadian market.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you maybe know, we have, I think,
meanwhile 25 different cannabis trends in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pharmacy, but only one whole plant
extraction from Canada so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that so?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the, like in Germany,
it's the German regulations and the German
[SPEAKER_01]: laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: We typically see regulations start
wherever it may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it starts state by state by state.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, it started the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start with flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a minimum viable product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's introduced to the market
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, you get some pretty
basic extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the Canadian extraction
market, the most popularized ones are
[SPEAKER_01]: these little tinctures where you have,
you know, 3% THC or 3% cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the rest is coconut oil or
propylene glycol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the patient in Canada actually has to
consume a lot of fluid to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids that they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you know, in a little bit more of
a conservative, even though we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: liberal government, in a little bit more
of a conservative society, it is an
[SPEAKER_01]: approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a step to administering that medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll start to see, in Canada,
we'll start to see that portfolio of
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts evolve a little bit further,
but because it's government led,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's federally led, it's very slow and
it's very conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Germany, we say, or some people
complain government is over-regulating the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis, would you say Health
Canada is under-regulating it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Health Canada is over-regulating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any LPs in the room,
you guys would also nod your heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a heavy over-regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they are commissioning committees
and basically public opinion to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what the public does want to
see from that component.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also Health Canada, I've seen and seen
some of the Health Canada regulators and
[SPEAKER_01]: representatives go down to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and go down to Colorado California,
Washington, Oregon, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: are some, say, some very established
states when it comes to the medical and
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational markets to talk to them about
different products that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: released.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be on the side where maybe the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't regulated enough in terms of,
you know, some of the extracts that may be
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a gummy bear in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: that has a thousand milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you eat that, you're on your ass for
two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a conservative approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a patient, I don't, to be completely
honest, I've never rolled a joint in my
[SPEAKER_01]: entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So edibles were also scary to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know, like, if I had one,
when was it going to kick in?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it going to be like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's very normal for people that
don't consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having a small approach,
a conservative approach, I think is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to build that trust within that consumer
brand or the consumer market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zach, when it comes to consumer trust,
to building a brand, we have seen that the
[SPEAKER_00]: other kind of extractions are already
available somehow here on our market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your rosin tech is, I've seen it in
Spanish social clubs a lot, meanwhile,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's a really small revolution going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, your product is not in the
pharmacies yet, and it's not on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: here yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you see the, what's the future
of rosin tech, of rosin extraction?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so overall right now, it is on the
end consumer side and in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing a lot of clubs in Spain,
but also interests in the Netherlands and
[SPEAKER_05]: other places.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are seeing a lot of, like
originally when we were getting started in
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe about two years ago, it was the
patients reaching out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Patients with stage four cancer looking
for an affordable way to get their oil
[SPEAKER_05]: would contact us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then tell their friends, and that's
kind of how we got our start in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think going forward, rosin as a very
affordable way, almost like having a
[SPEAKER_05]: juicer in your kitchen or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I envision rosin in the future
for Europe being really popular for the
[SPEAKER_05]: end consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, as we head more towards the
recreational side in Europe, down the
[SPEAKER_05]: road, I hope to have the solvent-less
experience like we do in the US,
[SPEAKER_05]: where you can bring your flour,
we'll press for you for free, and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: just all out in the open.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all about education.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I think down the road,
you're gonna start to see more shows where
[SPEAKER_05]: there's more pressing going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people bringing their buds and you
educate them, whether it's CBD flour or
[SPEAKER_05]: with CHC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've seen it developing in Barcelona
the year before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, I think there were four or five
booths and they were all crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my last question, because time is
really pushing us, goes out to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never talked about terpene extraction
so far, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: But terpene is also something you can
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only cannabinoids, you also can
extract terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us something about that, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: So terpenes, obviously, the boiling point
is gonna be very different than that of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason that you smell them is because
they're boiling off, they're volatile.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the extraction methodology for that,
believe it or not, CO2 actually is a
[SPEAKER_03]: fantastic way to extract the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen some extremely good terpene
products come from CO2 extractors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that equipment on scale,
which is really what my business is
[SPEAKER_03]: focused towards, is difficult because when
you start to talk about terpene extraction
[SPEAKER_03]: at scale, you're involving heat,
you're involving pressure, which changes
[SPEAKER_03]: the actual terpene structure itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at that point, it's really a question
of what scale, who's actually
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturing these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are a very viable product.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also have medicinal aspects to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say that terpenes plus
cannabinoids are really the key to the
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as the extraction methodology
goes, I would say the best extraction
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques for getting the terpenes would
be CO2, hydrocarbon, and actual steam
[SPEAKER_03]: slash vacuum distillation themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd really, really like to go a lot deeper
into the material, but time is pushing so
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it again for the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have one quick question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because you mentioned the terpene
extraction, and I've seen a lot of new
[SPEAKER_04]: companies who specialize in terpenes,
but they're not cannabis-derived terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like artificially, not
artificially, but created.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get terpenes from somewhere other
than the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they the same?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the same thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it different?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are the molecules different?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a fantastic question.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cool thing about cannabis is that it
has an array of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, for analytics on that side,
we really have trouble determining which
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes are in the actual plant because
there's so many.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's hundreds.
[SPEAKER_03]: There might even be some that are unique
to the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what you're discussing is that yes,
absolutely they are the same molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rose hips, orange peels, eucalyptus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much any plant that has a good
smell, those terpenes may be found in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what a lot of companies are doing is
they're taking extracts from other plants
[SPEAKER_03]: that can be done at a much larger scale
efficiently, mixing them together to mimic
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes profiles from cannabis.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: They may smell the same and taste the
same, but will they have the same effect?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the question, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you actually look at the profiles
on cannabis, there's so many small amounts
[SPEAKER_03]: of these terpenes that you can't really
get from other plants that when in
[SPEAKER_03]: conjunction with each other, they make
different effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really hard to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really great field of study.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's going to be something that
we really need to, as an industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: push towards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all very, very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it again for our panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very informative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
