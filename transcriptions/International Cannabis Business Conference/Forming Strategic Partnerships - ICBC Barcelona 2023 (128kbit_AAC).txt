[SPEAKER_07]: And now this panel, we're going to discuss
forming strategic partnerships.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to lead this panel, the CEO and
founder and international consultant for
[SPEAKER_07]: the New Holland Group, let's hear it for
Jamie Pearson!
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, hello, come on, people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we're not going to have photos,
okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: This chair feels amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so you know, it's comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the color.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so happy you all stayed here and
waited to the very end.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll see all of you at the party.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to say thank you to the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to dive right in.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll wait till all those people up there
get out.
Get out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, get out if you're going to talk.
Bye.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're going to... Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes it easier for everybody in the
crowd if we sit in front of our pictures,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we're going to do first is I'm
going to have my esteemed panel introduce
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody here is an expert in forming
strategic partnerships.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we're here to talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to let them introduce
themselves and talk about who they are and
[SPEAKER_05]: what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm George Terry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the executive vice president of
RADSource Technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a photonic decontamination company
that works on making sure that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: clean supply of cannabis flower without
gamma or E-beam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Petra Morinko.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from Pharmagic Company from
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are producers and manufacturers of
premium cosmetic products and food
[SPEAKER_00]: supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a bit different approach because I'm
passionate about clean cosmetics and clean
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't use anything toxic in our
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for sticking around till the end of
the day with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Brian Passman, Hunter and Esquire.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're an executive search firm.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're head hunters.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do human capital advisory.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started in 2017 to serve the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We expanded into psychedelics in 2020.
[SPEAKER_04]: We recruit globally on any role in the
cannabis or psychedelics ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_04]: primarily focused on executive leadership
placement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Dr. John.
[SPEAKER_03]: My company, United Science, basically puts
people into the business of cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do engineering.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been involved in a tremendous
number of different partnering and JVs and
[SPEAKER_03]: all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really excited to be on this panel and
just kind of talk about what's worked and
[SPEAKER_03]: what hasn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll introduce myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Jamie Pearson.
[SPEAKER_05]: As Ungayo said, I'm a consultant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do global consultancy now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was the CEO of Bang.
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you who know Bang Chocolate,
I did that job for three years.
[SPEAKER_05]: After seven years of being in the company,
I left.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people have been asking me to help
them bring their companies to Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my specific target this trip was
finding some of the bigger players that
[SPEAKER_05]: were wanting to do deals around $50 to
$200 million.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the big players that are going to
come conquer this market, I came to find
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're out there, come find me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the reason that I've been
successful in the cannabis industry is
[SPEAKER_05]: that I believe 100% that we are not
competitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are competitors.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are colleagues.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when people know each other and they
connect their networks, that's when magic
[SPEAKER_05]: happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to start by asking George,
I'm going to just go in order because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm linear.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kind of how my brain works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you name a time that you've formed a
partnership that was really beneficial to
[SPEAKER_05]: your company?
[SPEAKER_05]: And were there challenges in getting that
partnership formed?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if so, how did you overcome them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just recently, we formed a partnership
with Belushi Farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hang on one second.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, that was a panelist.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was about to go off on somebody out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a pass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody shut off your phones,
please.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's Passman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does he get a pass?
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't Passman.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Dr. John.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you gave Dr. John a pass, but that's
Passman.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said be entertaining.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be entertaining.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the last minute of the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's dying here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So recently, we just did a partnership
with Belushi Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jim Belushi does a show on discovery
called Growing Belushi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're doing a cannabis rescue in
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met him in MJ BizCon in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a problem with the flower was
very dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were not passing Aspergillus,
CFU.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have the equipment that can fix
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we formed this partnership with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The obstacles to overcome are mainly
regulations within the state of Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working together with them, understanding
what their scope was, what our scope was,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we could offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is together,
we formed a union that's going to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to help this failing farm in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 10 vendors in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lighting vendor that's
actually here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Fos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple other vendors that are
helping them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the nutrient one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have one for hydration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a really good strategic
partnership that we have with these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because not only are we helping them,
but they're helping us as far as the image
[SPEAKER_01]: of decontamination in general.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I can imagine it's a bad deal when
you're Belushi's farm, you're high
[SPEAKER_05]: profile, and then you have someone say
your flower is dirty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody wants to hear that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That can really harm a company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you provide a solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where a strategic partnership was a
win-win.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the other thing I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Win-win is the key.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because even if you could get a home run,
but you make sure the other side has the
[SPEAKER_05]: win.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when the partnerships last forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Petra, same question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great partnerships that you could name.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if there's been an obstacle,
or when you have to vet somebody,
[SPEAKER_05]: talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we were lucky to find a really good
partner from Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canole is the name of the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny how in every business it's
hard to find a partner that has the same
[SPEAKER_00]: goals that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oriented in the similar business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually it's all about the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to that, there are so
many steps to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes gut feeling is the thing
that gets you going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if we still listen to that,
I think that we're safe there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a challenge to do this,
especially in cannabis business,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people come into this
just because, okay, cannabis, we see the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits and the prices go and we will
earn a lot of money and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of people that don't
actually mean something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we kind of got lucky and we're really
hoping to develop a really nice strategic
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they do exactly?
[SPEAKER_00]: They do different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do medical cannabis facilities now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have their connection and they
are distributors for products that we
[SPEAKER_00]: make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you make the product and they
distribute them in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did you find them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, they found me through ICBC pitch
that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Global investment forum that I had three
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every partnership takes a while
and you cannot do anything through the
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were picky too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't go for the first one who
came.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really important who you
choose to represent you and to represent
[SPEAKER_00]: your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if someone does that, it's important
that it stands, that it has the same
[SPEAKER_00]: principles that you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people want speed to market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people want price protection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever it is you want, you've got to
find the right partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cooperation is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the communication, we can adjust to a
lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we can have someone say how
it goes in different markets and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's really important too that
we, for me as a brand ambassador,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a brand presenter, that I need to be
involved also in those kind of business
[SPEAKER_00]: with strategic partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because eventually, at the end of the day,
it's the brand that sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it must be important who to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important who you choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how they do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brian is a headhunter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm thinking about when I was running
Bang and I was using recruitment services
[SPEAKER_05]: to place executives, naturally,
you're going to be a strategic partner for
[SPEAKER_05]: me because I'm going to tell you
everything I need and you got to go find
[SPEAKER_05]: that person.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also found working with you that
partnership was different because it was
[SPEAKER_05]: truly a partnership.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not just here's the task,
go jump through the hoop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So talk to me about how headhunters for
companies can be strategic partners in
[SPEAKER_05]: ways that people in the audience maybe
aren't aware of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree with everything you said
earlier about partnerships coming through,
[SPEAKER_04]: building relationships, getting to know
each other, which is I think how often all
[SPEAKER_04]: of our strategic partnerships came about.
[SPEAKER_04]: We knew each other socially really well
before we started working together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got loads of great stories from
consuming weird stuff on mountaintops with
[SPEAKER_04]: people that became clients to the stories
galore.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a fun, I think, real quick on my
strategic partnership story because I have
[SPEAKER_04]: a fun one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the guys that run the Canadian
Securities Exchange are pretty fun to hang
[SPEAKER_04]: out with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they approached us at a gathering in
Miami Beach a year or two ago and asked if
[SPEAKER_04]: we would mind being listed on their
website as a search partner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, wow, what's that going to
cost?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know you place a lot of the people that
a lot of our clients need.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would actually be doing us a favor if
we can just refer someone to you instead
[SPEAKER_04]: of trying to help them hire their chief
accounting officer, whomever they needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously a big win for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a lot of business from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a funny way, a win for them because
they didn't have to try to be recruiters.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not everyone wants to try to be a
recruiter as their hobby.
[SPEAKER_04]: So having a good recruiter as a strategic
partner rather than a vendor is a benefit
[SPEAKER_04]: to our clients and companies that use
recruiters in a similar partnership way
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're your eyes and ears out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're talking to everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the industry, they're driving business
your way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our clients get referrals from us all of
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't like to monetize every
introduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their success is our success.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a reason my LinkedIn pronoun is
super connector.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just love making introductions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think my partner wishes I'd monetize
more of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think I would have the
goodwill that we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to build up a lot of goodwill
currency in your bank account in this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's all I have to say on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so I'm kind of a fangirl of Dr. John.
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't know that, but I just disclosed
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's kind of a big deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's doing a lot of pharmaceutical work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's going to be big in
Europe because I think where cannabis in
[SPEAKER_05]: America, in most of the states,
started from medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's different, though,
here where the medical element of it
[SPEAKER_05]: really does require EUGMP API.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actual pharmaceutical ingredients have to
be run through pharmaceutical grade
[SPEAKER_05]: technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question to you is, you have these
companies in Europe and in the US that are
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you help them get launched in
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we help them on many, many different
levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not just products coming from us
to them or even services.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, we might connect a grower in
one region under our GACP with a GMP
[SPEAKER_03]: producer in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we might connect a US investor that
wants to get into the EUGMP world with a
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical company and a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done all of those connections.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes we're involved in the
transaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it's just, hey, here we know
this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're looking for this other guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a nice way to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it allows them to grow their business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get social credit, and we also get
the business credit in the process of
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that we've really
been working on is making sure that the
[SPEAKER_03]: products that we have are applicable to
the pharmaceutical world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one example of a very good JV that we
just went through recently is a company
[SPEAKER_03]: where we're using our technology,
which is basically CO2, and we're using
[SPEAKER_03]: that to create water-soluble products for
formulations, which we weren't in before.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just one step away from what we
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's using our technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a Canadian company.
[SPEAKER_03]: The company is called Isolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our JV is Isolate USA JV.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're basically providing them access
to the market, access to pharmaceuticals,
[SPEAKER_03]: access to in European customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually operating in our
facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they brought tobacco companies to
us with a bunch of tobacco money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's stuff that I never could have
connected myself, but now we're creating
[SPEAKER_03]: all kinds of APIs based on nicotine,
for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That has nothing to do with cannabis,
but we also do cannabis work and
[SPEAKER_03]: connecting those people now with our
customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that we always look at JV
partners or joint venture partners with,
[SPEAKER_03]: does it fit strategically?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it fulfill the need in both of our
portfolios?
[SPEAKER_03]: And can we work together?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we like each other?
[SPEAKER_03]: That type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of that's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like single malt scotch or not?
[SPEAKER_03]: That type of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to see their name come across
your phone, or you're not like,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, it's that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, not him again.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, oh, I get to talk to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't work with the rest of the team,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do the cultures really work well
together?
[SPEAKER_03]: When we do JV work, basically the teams
get integrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if their culture doesn't match your
culture, just in the way they work,
[SPEAKER_03]: that won't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the most fundamental thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there has to be a culture match with
the joint venture partnerships.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think culture's the most important,
first fundamental piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I was going to give every one of you a
piece of advice, because everyone loves
[SPEAKER_05]: unsolicited advice, it would be that you
have to open your mind to the possibility
[SPEAKER_05]: of a connection.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really believe that if you think
everyone that comes at you is a colleague
[SPEAKER_05]: and not a competitor, and you think,
because I think sometimes people are like,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, that person's competitive to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you may be competitive in one thing
that you overlap.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you do become partners,
you figure out, you either retain that
[SPEAKER_05]: piece, do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you can figure out how to make that
person, their gaps fill your gaps,
[SPEAKER_05]: you become stronger.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have to be willing to give up a
little bit of something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that might be control.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of us have control issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have control issues, but some of
us do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody want to add something?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the biggest thing is
understanding what your strength is and
[SPEAKER_01]: where you exceed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody's going to do it by themselves,
especially in this industry and in most
[SPEAKER_01]: industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to really understand where
you need the help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got to be a symbiotic
relationship where you're going to help
[SPEAKER_01]: them, they're going to help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do it with regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it with some of the states in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got consultants that we work with as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what I give you and what you give me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you're going to give me
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'm going to give you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end, we're both going to be
rising.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not going to be safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be generous.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to be willing to give more
and be generous.
[SPEAKER_05]: It always pays you back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had competitors that we've worked
with competitors where we provide products
[SPEAKER_03]: that they don't have, actually,
for downstream processing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it works well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not afraid to help your competitor.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I've had calls with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shows like this are really great for
meeting people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's on a personal basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love what you're saying that you operate
that way and how you answer the other
[SPEAKER_04]: question.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like you're building ecosystems
within your strategic partner communities,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to also add that what is
really great, I think one of the big
[SPEAKER_04]: overriding themes of conversations I've
had today, hearing about people that are
[SPEAKER_04]: setting up in Europe, is the idea of
coopetition, which seems to be something
[SPEAKER_04]: that the European cannabis community is
grasping because it's so challenging here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has been missing a lot for the
most part, aside from what you're saying
[SPEAKER_04]: we're seeing up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been missing in the American cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more like crabs in a barrel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the coopetition attitude
everyone's taking here is really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really key.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not afraid to refer business
and clients and whatnot around,
[SPEAKER_04]: it comes back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, again, I'll probably mention it
a dozen more times, just the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: goodwill thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big, small community, and
coopetition's where it's at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Petra?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just wanted to add something
regarding the competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, for example, the competition is a
target customer because they need
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm the first one to know how bad it
is if you don't have a good product on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know their needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think to know what you do best,
like George said before, is the key
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient to adjust to the risky
competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're all basically saying the
same thing, coopetition, helping a
[SPEAKER_05]: competitor, knowing your strengths.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically being generous with your
spirit, with your time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cannabis, we have to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all need help.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I don't think everybody realizes is
that these two gentlemen at the end are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a strategic partnership with that
microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a cute observation.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, I want to know if there's any
questions from the audience for our group.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: When does our panel end?
Never.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ongoing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're stuck here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's when the drinks are ready,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we done at 5?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we done at 515?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you have a question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Tor.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Tor Hamler of Green Nexus Seed
Cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get new opportunities to work
with people.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a process?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, for evaluating new opportunities.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is absolutely disciplined.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, because first of all, like in my
business, we can go in 100 different
[SPEAKER_03]: directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have an ingredients company from
DuPont calling us, asking us to do
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have fermentation companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, let's say, oil and gas companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you have broad-based technologies,
and you do broad-based marketing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to get in a whole bunch of
different types of inquiries and requests.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you sift through all of those to
make a disciplined approach?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you really have to start first with
your strategy in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: You must have a company strategy and your
vision for your company.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have that in a three-year goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's our company going to look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to describe what that looks like
to your employees, to your business
[SPEAKER_03]: development people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you need to have your company
values really well established so that you
[SPEAKER_03]: can understand, OK, well, maybe that
doesn't fit because that's not in our
[SPEAKER_03]: company value.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oil and gas company comes to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a sustainable company.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, let them go do what they're going to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, the last thing I would say is,
back in the 90s, everybody was doing these
[SPEAKER_03]: strategy maps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's a really great
discipline.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has allowed us to follow a market
strategy, which is, OK, we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: invest in the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a market strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we tie that to a product strategy
with a strategy map.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, well, here's the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what it looks like at one step,
one step, two step, three.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we just look upstream and
downstream of that, and upstream of where
[SPEAKER_03]: we're operating, those are potential
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because not only we can provide channel,
we can provide market.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if they're not upstream or downstream,
then they don't fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they're out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they're out, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a triage committee on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And usually, you have to have your
executives involved in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, are we going to go after this market,
or are we not?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tell you the truth that,
if you are very focused on what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing, focused in on success with one
single market strategy, it is a superior
[SPEAKER_03]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it just is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So market strategies are really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have lots of different products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody up here has lots of different
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in the cannabis industry,
we say, it's easy to get the something
[SPEAKER_05]: shiny syndrome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's opportunity everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're constantly being distracted
by this, that, or the other thing,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you have one strategy, and you do that
one thing, and you do it really well,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a good item for your success.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the other thing is, we have a framework
process also that we run.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we have quarterly meetings with
our top staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also an R&D.
[SPEAKER_03]: R&D is where all this stuff comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get all the great ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every idea goes on a list.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we process it according to a process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you bump it up against your
values.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of strategy is to kill stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the purpose of strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can kill it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's too many ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's too many markets to go after.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's too many different potential
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, which ones make the
most sense for your organization?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which ones will fit with your organization
and fill in gaps where the joint venture
[SPEAKER_03]: will be profitable for both entities?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say early in my career,
we had a less disciplined way of doing
[SPEAKER_03]: JVs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are all gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those JVs are gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: They either didn't work, or the partners
weren't right, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Focus is the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And make sure you do a process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Run the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because even with a two-man company,
or a two-lady company, or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: even with a small company, you can follow
a market strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can still say, here's my values.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my three-year goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's my big rocks that I'm going to
be working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And review those every quarter so that you
don't get off track.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can destroy your business
pursuing a dream of someone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't want to do that.
You got anything to say you want to add?
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions out there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there's one back there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you shout, please?
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm coming with the microphone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here I come.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the price is right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name is Humberto.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Portugal, working mainly on the
hemp business, but also on medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: My main question of so many questions I
would ask you all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, thank you so much,
George, Terry, for being probably one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the only representatives of other genetic
human groups here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mean to blame the fact that.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Ngaio?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but especially to Terry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like my brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look alike.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my main question is, we've seen a lot
of movements lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Colombia, for example,
was being hauled for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no exportations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clever leaves, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have South America providing
the western, the northern western
[SPEAKER_02]: hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also on the hemp side, let me tell you,
Zimbabwe is providing providing to Europe
[SPEAKER_02]: very, very cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is I'm formulating,
if you allow me, is selling a lot of CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: African CBD to Europe now for extractions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this show at least suggests that in the
near future, all this billionaire
[SPEAKER_02]: investments that are being being done in
North America and in Europe have their
[SPEAKER_02]: days count.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what strategies to adapt to a point
where cannabis is a commodity being
[SPEAKER_02]: cheaply produced in the southern
hemisphere?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the strategy for the companies here
in the northern western hemisphere?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, from my perspective, we actually
have a unit, Columbia, we're putting units
[SPEAKER_01]: in Canada, and we're now almost GMP here
in the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually contracted with consultants
in this area, much like Jamie,
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring us into this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key thing, and I said this in Berlin,
is knowing your regulatory landscape,
[SPEAKER_01]: know what's required of you, of what you
have to do, and the partners that you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: need to get you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we first came in to the EU at ICBC
in Berlin two years ago, we didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a consultant that knew the market,
brought on attorneys in Germany and
[SPEAKER_01]: Düsseldorf and other consultants,
brought in a consultant in Canada for us
[SPEAKER_01]: to get IQ, OQ, PQ, so that we were able to
do the GMP process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew I knew we weren't going to do
it alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to understand what you need from
those people and set timelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, I said this is not going to
be a three-year process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted this to be a one-year process
that ended up being a two-year process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So set a timeline, have milestones,
and just involve other people,
[SPEAKER_01]: pick the right people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might cost you some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we also have people that are in the
industry, like Xavier.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been excellent to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's connected us to a lot of the people
in this room, Maria and some of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are very famous in this room,
in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So events like this are very important,
guys, because you get to network with
[SPEAKER_01]: people and you get to learn about other
people's business and what their other
[SPEAKER_01]: hurdles are and what their other
strategies are, and you get the
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligence on what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know, Malta's moving ahead of
Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's where the consultants
leapfrog you.
[SPEAKER_05]: They might cost you some money,
but the time that you spend figuring it
[SPEAKER_05]: out for yourself costs you the same money.
[SPEAKER_05]: But time is the compounding factor for a
lot of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say, to answer your question,
I would mimic what George is saying,
[SPEAKER_05]: that you need to know what all the
compliance things are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, when the German
regulation, the draft regulations came out
[SPEAKER_05]: and they said they were not allowing
import, understanding why is that the
[SPEAKER_05]: draft regulation, and then perhaps hiring
a regulatory consultant to go do some
[SPEAKER_05]: lobbying to get the law changed so that
you can get your product in or find the
[SPEAKER_05]: work around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you get your product into Portugal,
do the EUGMP certified dance, and then get
[SPEAKER_05]: that product can go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always a workaround if you find
it, but you got to know what the rules
[SPEAKER_05]: are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_05]: South America, I have a client that's a
Colombian company that's currently working
[SPEAKER_05]: in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're producing great cannabis so
cheaply, but it isn't welcome right now
[SPEAKER_05]: for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of that is, if you're in Germany
and you're going to have an industry and
[SPEAKER_05]: the EU is not going to approve you because
you can't cross borders, they're waiting
[SPEAKER_05]: for that EU approval, and that might be
one of the hurdles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, Germans are saying,
maybe we're not going to have border
[SPEAKER_05]: crossing for rec, but they will have it
for medical.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it just boils down to knowing what the
rules are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I would also begin with the
end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you want to be in the growing
area, you want to leverage maybe some land
[SPEAKER_03]: that you have, or you're looking at the
market saying, wow, this is supposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: have a very high compound in your growth
rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I want to be in this market.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, why don't you begin with the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go get your takeoffs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go get the takeoff agreements.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go get the contracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go do your business development up front.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make sure that you have that base
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you rely on distribution after the
fact, you're way behind the eight ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a classic mistake.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to grow some weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I've got a bunch of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I do with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it just doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your weed is going to sit there for a year
and it's not going to be sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you need to do is go do that
business development first.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be hitting all the shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be the ultimate networker.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be, you know, before you start
growing anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, a lot of people like,
oh, how do you find those people?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I find it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: LinkedIn is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, everybody here has, I mean,
we're a LinkedIn star, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so go on LinkedIn and find and start a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything starts with a conversation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Petra?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the same with our business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you do a product, you firstly,
the main thing that you need to know is
[SPEAKER_00]: who is your customer and customer and why
are you doing this for them and what are
[SPEAKER_00]: you doing for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually are lucky to have Slovenia
being so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a two million population to
test the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really interesting how some
products don't do that well on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: when you thought that would be a hit or a
bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will sell really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nice to know where the where to
go and to adjust quickly because the time
[SPEAKER_00]: difference that comes from one product to
another product is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you place something on the market,
you should always be ready to make
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the key things to be successful in
this kind of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a risky business because we don't
know what will happen to tomorrow with the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's the catch 22.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to be ready to pivot quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to you want to buy packaging
at scale and then you buy one hundred
[SPEAKER_05]: thousand boxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you'll do that regulation
changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, you know,
you got to be ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to predict some things that could
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to have deep enough pockets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: To allow for things to not go right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times the regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my big thing is that's all I
deal with is regulations between 50 states
[SPEAKER_01]: and however many countries is they
telepath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to figure it out sitting
in Atlanta, Georgia or Fort Lauderdale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where my friends in the industry
call me up and they say, hey, did you hear
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on with these guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or hey, did you hear what's going on in
Michigan or Colorado or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the kinds of partnerships.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the kind of friendships you want
to make in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's going on in Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on in the EU?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the kind of events where you can
make those those those those friendships
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you know, hey, I know somebody
who's in Canada or I know somebody who's
[SPEAKER_01]: in Slovenia or I know somebody who's in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me reach out to them and see if
they've heard anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and I always I can't tell you how
many times today I said to people,
[SPEAKER_05]: don't assume I know I would rather hear
the same piece of information 40 times
[SPEAKER_05]: than never hear it because everyone's
like, oh, Jamie already knows that if you
[SPEAKER_05]: hear something and you think somebody
needs to know it, be a resource.
[SPEAKER_05]: Share the information.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: What time is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And when do we end?
[SPEAKER_07]: It is 5 16 and we end at 5 15.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if there's one more question,
one more question from the audience,
[SPEAKER_07]: is there one more?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, why do you wait?
[SPEAKER_05]: Greg Dunaway, Maple Creek Consulting.
[SPEAKER_05]: What can we do for you?
[SPEAKER_06]: As the industry scales up, you're one of
the top recruiters in the United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the pivotal positions for people
in Europe that you see either being filled
[SPEAKER_06]: poorly as companies scale in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: or are difficult to place for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, way to save the easy one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so we we do live in the constant
state of being called on to fill the
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult to fill roles.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I want to live.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want our clients just feel like
they have to call us with everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually had this conversation
earlier with some other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if the European market is
there yet, but really difficult to fill
[SPEAKER_04]: roles are head of legal, head of finance.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't a lot of people here told me that
the market here is not mature enough to
[SPEAKER_04]: need a lot of that hiring.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are really difficult to fill
roles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it'll be as difficult in
Europe as it's been in the states for CFOs
[SPEAKER_04]: in particular because of the current state
of the industry with federal prohibition,
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's a really risky role.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're asking someone to take on a lot of
risk and put their name on a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: signature on a lot of things that maybe
haven't been done before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you filling them with infractional
people?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we we do expect more of that to
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of those professional
professionals are more and more and more
[SPEAKER_04]: interested in fractional roles and outside
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: role.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then are you bringing Americans with
that experience over to Europe?
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're done here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate you all being here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if any of you need anything,
look at this group.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it all again for a fantastic
panelist.
[SPEAKER_07]: We thank you all for coming to the
International Candidates Business
[SPEAKER_07]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_07]: in Barcelona, twenty twenty three.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the Auditoria de Cornea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to I-spire for being our title
sponsor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Spandex for having us over.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to all of you for coming to
support.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see you at the after party tonight
at the Art Hotel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Starts at nine o'clock and we'll see you
in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is I'm Guy Obelam.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all so very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: See you later.
Thank you.
Thank you.
