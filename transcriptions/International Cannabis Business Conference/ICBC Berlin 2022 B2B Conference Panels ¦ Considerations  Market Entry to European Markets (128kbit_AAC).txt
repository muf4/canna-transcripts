[SPEAKER_06]: Hi everyone, it's a pleasure to see you
all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you're having a great time in Berlin,
as we are, and thanks to Alex Weidner and
[SPEAKER_06]: everyone at ICBC for a wonderful
conference so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always a pleasure to be a part of
their programs.
[SPEAKER_06]: They really do a great job of bringing
people around the world together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a fantastic panel here to discuss
entry into the European market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to briefly say hello to our
panelists here, allow them to introduce
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start at the far end, my friend
Martin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Martin, could you please say a few words
about yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my name is Martin Webke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a partner of SKW Schwartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a law firm, three men people,
with 70 years history in Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a large international network,
also working with Tom very closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with three colleagues of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Julia, Mark, Rick, and Oliver,
all in the hall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an M&A lawyer practicing for 20 years,
venture capital, M&A, private equity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and part of the cannabis team for SKW.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dear friend Guillermo, say a few words
about yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom, my name is Guillermo Fern√°ndez.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the co-founder of SCF Abogados.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a law firm specializing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked all over Spain since 13 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work around Europe and also some in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Benedict, thanks, Steve.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very great looking forward to this
panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Benedict, co-founder and managing director
of Kanzativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kanzativa is really one of the first
companies within the cannabis space in
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're active since 2017 and are the
exclusive partner of Bfarm when it comes
[SPEAKER_05]: to the distribution of cannabis from
domestic cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our simple goal is that we want to enable
cannabis and become the largest retail
[SPEAKER_05]: platform in the leading B2B marketplace
within the recreational space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, and Sonja?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everyone, it's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Sonja Bonelli and I'm the CEO
of New Garden Group.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our business has two focuses.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one medical GMP facility in North
Macedonia.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a second one here in the heart of
Berlin where we produce health and
[SPEAKER_04]: wellness products as well as a private
label.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have successfully positioned our
brand Herbless on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel free to come and visit us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Sonja.
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you who don't know me,
I'm Tom Zuber.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the manager partner of Zuberwaller.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have been in cannabis in America since
2006, which makes us a science sort of.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we were probably the first
bonafide corporate law firm in the space.
[SPEAKER_06]: We represent a large percentage of the
biggest brands in North American cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go ahead and get started with Sonja.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sonja, this is a question for the whole
group.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's start with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is the European cannabis market
heading over the next six, 12 months?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Tom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, we all want to see the
recreational market open.
[SPEAKER_04]: Following the public consultation hearing,
which has been concluded in the past
[SPEAKER_04]: month, I think the regulation is now
heading towards the final stages.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will hopefully see a draft law reaching
the parliament by the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: The agenda is clearly very ambitious.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, there are a lot of political and
legislative hurdles, such as the UN single
[SPEAKER_04]: prevention.
[SPEAKER_04]: As well as the shame treaty, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the most important thing is really
to see government establishing those
[SPEAKER_04]: social and health as well as commercial
and taxation policies to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: provide a secure, above-functioning
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at the CBD industry, it's going
through quite a rough time at the moment,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simply because of the very complicated
regulatory environment, normal food is
[SPEAKER_04]: still an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially in Germany, we are still seeing
authorities going against CBD products,
[SPEAKER_04]: which makes it really difficult for
companies to really deliver a sustainable
[SPEAKER_04]: business model.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at some other markets in Europe,
like UK, for example, or the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_04]: where CBD is tolerated and is still sold
as a food supplement, they are performing
[SPEAKER_04]: much better.
[SPEAKER_04]: The conversation that we're having now
with the UK companies, they're all saying
[SPEAKER_04]: that the market has recovered quite well
post-COVID or post lockdowns, especially
[SPEAKER_04]: the brick and mortar markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the trend in Germany has been mostly
negative.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing declining revenues,
but also we're seeing very little
[SPEAKER_04]: willingness.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of scale, we're seeing very
little willingness from the bigger retail
[SPEAKER_04]: chains to list the CBD products in absence
of legal clarity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we're still far away.
[SPEAKER_04]: The normal food process and everything
that the IH is doing also on the
[SPEAKER_04]: toxicological studies and so on,
I think this is going to take a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be an easy fix.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see how this will evolve.
[SPEAKER_04]: In general, it's the CBD industry at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an easy place to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say it's not impossible.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have managed, with our own brand,
our risk to get quite a big market share.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even last year we expanded to 30
countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's our product that plays with the major
retailers because we have been building a
[SPEAKER_04]: brand since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is something that is very
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that has been neglected in the
past in the CBD space.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are seeing much more quality brands,
I have to say, on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that as we move on and as the
industry expands, this will be even much
[SPEAKER_04]: more important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those brands or those companies
who are building brands and who are
[SPEAKER_04]: building a compelling story behind the
brand will ultimately be the winners.
[SPEAKER_04]: In general, I think when we look at the
market from a medical perspective,
[SPEAKER_04]: or in general, just the cannabis market,
there is still a lot of stigma.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is still a lack of understanding of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The medical market in Germany is by far
the biggest in Europe, but there is still
[SPEAKER_04]: only 2% of the doctors willing to
prescribe a medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are different reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it really comes down to the legal
framework, to the education, and also to
[SPEAKER_04]: clinical evidence.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is just not enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although there is real-life evidence,
which has a lot of validation and should
[SPEAKER_04]: be ignored, but that educational process
needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Education needs to happen, and also this
more simplified legal framework in Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to be able to allow the industry to
expand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the legal clarity, both on the THC
and the CBD side, will have to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will see the industry expand,
which will bring very much new stability,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially on the capital markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Sonja.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a very helpful overview.
[SPEAKER_06]: Martin or Benedict, would you mind telling
us, doing a bit more of a dive into
[SPEAKER_06]: Germany, what is going on here,
as long as we are here, particularly on
[SPEAKER_06]: the recreational front, what are we going
to see over the next couple of years in
[SPEAKER_06]: regards to recreational cannabis here in
Germany?
[SPEAKER_05]: Shall I kick it off?
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, what was already mentioned
is we are in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization process, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany is really the driving force I
would consider that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be that Germany will be the
starting point for a whole domino effect
[SPEAKER_05]: across Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we do here is a thing that didn't
happen in history.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should be all aware of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes to the German market,
we already know that there is an existing
[SPEAKER_05]: illicit market.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are already, on an annual base,
400, maybe 800 metric tons sold on an
[SPEAKER_05]: annual base.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to translate this into an
addressable market, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe four, even eight billion euros as an
addressable market, but we use the 10
[SPEAKER_05]: euros program as a figure for a better
price.
[SPEAKER_05]: The economic perspective is massive,
and in addition to that, it is also clear
[SPEAKER_05]: that the state, the federal republic,
they can benefit from such a program.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, which is good, and what we heard
already today among those great panels,
[SPEAKER_05]: is that everyone is aware of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everyone here in this room feels
this intense process already, is excited
[SPEAKER_05]: about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But me, as someone who's in the middle of
the industry, obviously talking to
[SPEAKER_05]: politicians, talking to other suppliers,
talking to distributors, talking to
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmacies or potential point of sales,
there is still just this aspect that we
[SPEAKER_05]: need to wait for some further clarity.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of things can still go wrong,
but if we have these debates, these
[SPEAKER_05]: discussions, I believe that also
timeline-wise, what Mr. Lienert mentioned
[SPEAKER_05]: earlier this morning, if we have a draft
law beginning of next year, there is a
[SPEAKER_05]: real opportunity that quite shortly after
that, we have the first set of sales,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's something I'm super excited
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what we also saw last week is
that Malta, Luxembourg, and Germany
[SPEAKER_05]: published a joint statement on certain
regulatory aspects of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: framework, which is also a nice indicator
that things are also discussed on a
[SPEAKER_05]: European level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, you saw, you mentioned, the UN
Single Convention, European law,
[SPEAKER_05]: and all that, and it's a good sign,
and I'm very optimistic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good, and what's a short time frame,
assuming that legislation passes early
[SPEAKER_06]: next year?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's a short time frame?
[SPEAKER_06]: Six months, 12 months, 24 months,
before we see the first sales,
[SPEAKER_06]: recreational?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's really hard to assess,
because a lot of bits and pieces are in
[SPEAKER_05]: the responsibility of the regulator and of
governmental authorities, but we have a
[SPEAKER_05]: clear commitment from our government that
within their legislative period,
[SPEAKER_05]: there will be cannabis legally sold in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they mentioned in their
coalition agreement, so it definitely will
[SPEAKER_05]: be before September 2025.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's their clear commitment,
and if I were them, I would try to make
[SPEAKER_05]: this happen earlier to also have this
support for a future election,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe from all the people, not only in
this room, but out there, because I
[SPEAKER_05]: believe the society is ready for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gerard, would you mind telling us what's
going on in Spain on the THC front,
[SPEAKER_06]: medicinal and if you care to, recreational
as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, thank you, Tom.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Spain, the medical regulation just
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be implemented in a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are one step behind from Germany,
for example, but that's good news for
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medical agency has now like six months
to study the head subcommission
[SPEAKER_00]: resolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: This medical resolution will allow people
access to cannabis with medical conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: like multiple sclerosis, some seizure
disorders, endometriosis, nausea and
[SPEAKER_00]: vomiting for chemotherapy, pain related to
cancer, chronic pain, including
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's been illegal to grow in Spain for
a lot of years, but this medical
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation is implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacy will be able to dispense to
qualify patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The situation is not as commercialized in
other countries, but it's a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: progress and a good proof for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the situation now, but keep an eye
on Spain because the political party in
[SPEAKER_00]: power, they asked my team to draft an
adult use regulation last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulation will be voted as soon as
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make it within the design
important first step to lead more change
[SPEAKER_00]: in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's see what happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: And why don't we stay with you,
Guillermo, and can you tell us a bit about
[SPEAKER_06]: the Spanish CBD market and what's going on
on that front as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the majority countries in Europe,
Spain has not its own CBD market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a huge market about CBD products
in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Spanish consumers actually use
CBD at much higher rates than other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as I said, there is a really,
really big market in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we are seeing a lot of
companies making moves to establish their
[SPEAKER_00]: position in the market ahead of further
legal change in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things change after the European
Court resolution on CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things change in a good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to explain quickly these three
segments of the market we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have CBD flowers, cosmetic products,
and food supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about the CBD flowers,
as a good attorney, I have to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: that you still can get in trouble with the
CBD flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a lot of demand for this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And risk comes with good business
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want you to know that we are being
successful in every single case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are winning every single case on court
because we are selling a cannabis flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the CBD flower is not psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this product is not psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The public health is not a risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what our judges and
prosecutors are starting to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also, if you want to sell CBD
flowers, import these flowers from any
[SPEAKER_00]: European legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for you to know if you have been in
Spain in a short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last one, two years, there is so
many stores selling CBD flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thankfully, this is not an appear to
be a priority for the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: About cosmetic products, cosmetic products
containing cannabis were never a focus for
[SPEAKER_00]: the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even less now, after European added
CBD, CBD, and CBD to available ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: in cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about cosmetics, and as
everybody knows, the European list for
[SPEAKER_00]: cosmetic ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about food supplements, I think that
everybody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said already, we have to wait what
happens with the European food
[SPEAKER_00]: administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Spain is a really good place now to
set up a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it quickly and expensively.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a huge market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a present, a significant sort of
midterm opportunity for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for entrepreneurs who are not afraid
of a piece of risk, there is an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to get an early foothold in
the market with many kind of users trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to partnerization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely, it's a really good moment
to think about franchise as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Guillermo.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was very helpful of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Benedict, do you want to tell us,
the medical cannabis market is so exciting
[SPEAKER_06]: to watch from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: perspective helping here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to hear your thoughts and the
whole panel's thoughts, but starting with
[SPEAKER_06]: you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the medical market here still
attractive from your perspective?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is the right time to engage the
European cannabis market from both
[SPEAKER_06]: domestic practitioners, from domestic
companies and inspiring companies,
[SPEAKER_06]: and also from the international
perspective looking into Europe?
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, it's exciting that they also
talk about medical cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think many are very much focusing on
recreational.
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's face it, the only legal market
for Germany and many other countries in
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany is the medical cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the development first, it's super
exciting how it started here in 2017.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about 1.7 metric tons
sales in 2017.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year, we were up at 15 tons.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's quite a significant increase and
we expect for the next few years a further
[SPEAKER_05]: very positive development.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, when we then get deep dive,
into different parts of this German market
[SPEAKER_05]: and I talk about European market in a bit,
we need to look at patient, numbers of
[SPEAKER_05]: patients, we need to look at pharmacies
and we need to look at doctors.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, there are around 300,000 patients
in the German market.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we compare that, for example,
to Canada in a world pre-legalization of
[SPEAKER_05]: adult use in this country, there were
figures like 1% of the population that
[SPEAKER_05]: seem to be pretty reasonable.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have some potential here in Germany,
300,000 versus a potential of maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: 800,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's point one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those patients are divided into
self-payers, so very cost-sensitive payers
[SPEAKER_05]: and people and patients that are under
statutory health insurance coverage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is important to understand that
the part of those self-payers that are
[SPEAKER_05]: rather cost and price sensitive,
they might transfer in a legalized adult
[SPEAKER_05]: use market, maybe into self-therapy if the
offer in a adult use market is maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: cheaper and you have comparable products.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second group I wanted to look at is
the numbers of doctors and that was also
[SPEAKER_05]: already mentioned, there are not many
doctors actually prescribing medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a limited number, there can be still
significant growth and this comes back to
[SPEAKER_05]: a more professional education which needs
to be implemented and we as an industry
[SPEAKER_05]: need to work on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And last but not least, I think it's quite
interesting that out of 18,000 pharmacies,
[SPEAKER_05]: only around maybe two or three thousand
pharmacies in Germany are regularly
[SPEAKER_05]: dealing and handling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just maybe 100 are responsible for
significant portions of the market and
[SPEAKER_05]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also exciting to see that we have
on each of those groups still a huge
[SPEAKER_05]: potential, but if legalization of adult
use happens, there might be an effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I still believe it's a attractive
medical cannabis market in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's still plenty of opportunities
to enter the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it's not like two, three or five
years ago where you just needed to have a
[SPEAKER_05]: product and then somehow you can sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to be smart, you need to really
think through what's your business model,
[SPEAKER_05]: what's your part of the value chain,
what's your value proposition,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then there's still a lot of
opportunity to make a good business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the European opportunity,
obviously Germany is a very bit unique
[SPEAKER_05]: because we have statute of health
insurance coverage which helps to really
[SPEAKER_05]: accelerate potential sales, accelerate
revenues.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we see in other markets, let's look at
Malta, let's look at Poland, we see that
[SPEAKER_05]: exports are already, for example,
happening into those countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is something happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the other hand, there are
suppliers, cultivation sites in Denmark,
[SPEAKER_05]: in Spain, in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a whole ecosystem that
developed over the last few years and
[SPEAKER_05]: those companies are also making good
business.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other thoughts on the panel here,
particularly as to the timing,
[SPEAKER_06]: when is the right timing to enter the
European market from the perspective of
[SPEAKER_06]: the others inside it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say I'm also thankful to
be here and I think the recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, they will do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may take longer, but they want to have
the tax anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, this doesn't help us over the
next six to 12 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the original question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it going to look like in six to 12
months?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in the middle of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a crisis going on in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a very tense macroeconomic
climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're struggling with European finances.
[SPEAKER_01]: The European Central Bank is not really
daring to put up the interest rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a certain level because they say that
the economy will go down again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all framework conditions that
are not ideal for the market, not even in
[SPEAKER_01]: the healthcare market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a B2C, if we're talking about
medical kind of business, it's not a B2C
[SPEAKER_01]: business right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nonetheless, the investor climate is
decreasing, it's getting worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we as M&A lawyers, we see that,
we are told by the way, but the investors,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the climate is, we're like
pre-indicators.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not driving the deals, but I see
what's going on in deal activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is already reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, I think it has to be regarded
closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot say because recreation is a good
new thing, hey, this is two years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: two years in the future, sorry,
two years to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will not help us immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the industry has to face,
and also companies willing to do business
[SPEAKER_01]: here have to face, that this is still a
pharma business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real pharma business, and pharma is
complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's highly regulated, it takes long,
it requires huge investment, it takes
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, investors have really bought into
the infrastructure already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have been, I would invite
investors to go on and develop new
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines on a kind of business basis,
and we've just had little products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the market is not unlimited,
but it's still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the recreational will not help us out
of this situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nevertheless, I'm confident that this
industry will grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, in terms of the political
climate here in Germany, it's good that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have this kind of leadership in this area
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope that the government would
show this leadership maybe in other areas
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they need to drive this,
because the economy in the world is not
[SPEAKER_01]: great at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have divided worlds, they need to have
the industry move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my view, and I hope we all can
contribute to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Martin.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Martin, let's stay with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is really open to the whole panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love to hear everyone's perspective on
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any advice for companies that
are looking to enter the European market?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a general question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you get a general answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I cannot comment on the European
individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no prominent market in this area,
apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just say, if we talk to people
willing to enter the market, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: go to Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the largest market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's well equipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the infrastructure, the
infrastructure, also the players in this
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've spoken about this before we had this
panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's already set.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a couple of deals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have bought in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone knows what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis agency is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the problems are not high, but the
infrastructure is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can settle here, and you can use
Germany as a starting point for the
[SPEAKER_01]: European expansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have to be sure when you come
to Germany, of course, apart from the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory stuff and the tax setup,
you have to be sure what product you are
[SPEAKER_01]: selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be an investment company,
like a buy and build company?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that in Germany, also these
concepts are pursued.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you a developer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you trading a mixture of everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: In early stages of a market, this can
attract attention from investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also dilutes your business case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the end, investors want to earn
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to have a clear view on the cash
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there can only be one platform
or two platforms, but not a third and not
[SPEAKER_01]: a fourth one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to specialize.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be aware that this is a pharma
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really complicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'd like to add some further aspects
to these points.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the opportunity, if you enter the
medical cannabis market, to learn a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: about cannabis, about regulatory,
about quality systems, about distribution,
[SPEAKER_05]: about sales channels, about so many
aspects that are super important for not
[SPEAKER_05]: only the medical cannabis business,
but also for your recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: system that will happen at some point.
So I believe that some companies,
maybe this is a bit cash intended,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it might make sense to enter the
market, to learn, to get exposed to the
[SPEAKER_05]: mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because let's face it, the adult use
market, it will be a regulated market.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to accept that it will be highly
regulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we discussed some of those aspects in
this morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: What if the point of sales is licensed
dispensaries, but also pharmacies?
[SPEAKER_05]: What if marketing for products is not
allowed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are all things that in a certain
form already have existed in the medical
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I believe exposure here can be worth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for us as a company, we are in the
industry, you said dinosaur for the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are maybe dinosaurs for Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes to medical cannabis,
this is a real value proposition that you
[SPEAKER_05]: have, because you have a team,
you have processes, you have the
[SPEAKER_05]: knowledge, and all this is probably one of
those things that are super important for
[SPEAKER_05]: the recreational world as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: And any other comments on it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that the cannabis market is,
there's absolutely nothing just parallel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Transferable from territory to territory.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is the challenge in
Europe, that every single market is
[SPEAKER_04]: handling it differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that you also really need to
be operational in the market to understand
[SPEAKER_04]: how to work within the confines of the
existing legislation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And quite a complicated and restrictive
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that ultimately also in the
recreational business, the supply chain
[SPEAKER_04]: and for those companies who are already in
the supply chain or have built a
[SPEAKER_04]: distribution network, this is going to be
really, really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be different distribution
channels, but at least they understand the
[SPEAKER_04]: supply chain.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you say nothing is transferable
market to market, what do you mean by
[SPEAKER_06]: nothing is transferable market to market?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the legislative frameworks are
completely different in every European
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: How the license, the imports, the GCP,
the products, what goes into the
[SPEAKER_04]: formulation and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very different to each market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I meant.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a fascinating topic to me because
the United States obviously is split up by
[SPEAKER_06]: sovereign jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are 50 states and each state does it
differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: And furthermore, unlike Europe,
you can't put cannabis in the trunk of
[SPEAKER_06]: your car and drive it across the state
line without risking getting arrested.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Europe is, in some sense, going to
develop a little bit like the United
[SPEAKER_06]: States, I think, if it's okay to say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in some ways, it's going to develop,
I think, in a more exciting way with
[SPEAKER_06]: greater interaction between jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think at that point, it's worth
exploring, I think, where exactly things
[SPEAKER_06]: are going to fall.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of course, you're right,
market to market is going to be very
[SPEAKER_06]: different.
[SPEAKER_06]: But unlike the United States, you won't be
able to have operations that distribute
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis to different territories within
Europe way sooner than that's going to
[SPEAKER_06]: happen in the United States, which will
require federal legalization in the United
[SPEAKER_06]: States.
[SPEAKER_06]: So on that note, maybe Martin will come to
you weighing this point at you first,
[SPEAKER_06]: but this really is, again, for the whole
panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm a company outside the United
States, outside Europe, and I'm looking to
[SPEAKER_06]: enter, whether it's from Africa or from
anywhere else, where do I want to set up
[SPEAKER_06]: my holding company?
[SPEAKER_06]: What country do I want to be in and launch
operations from which to send cannabis out
[SPEAKER_06]: to the other European territories?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's not one answer, apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely, I mean, there are a couple
of players who have the holding structure
[SPEAKER_01]: also in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the couple of aspects are
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Substance, where is your focus?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not only relevant for tax
purposes, so even if you have a holding
[SPEAKER_01]: structure under the European regulations,
European guidelines, you have tax
[SPEAKER_01]: preferential tax treatment in a group.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, then you need to have substance
in the individual group entities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot say it's just a shell or it's a
post box.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't work anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, I think Germany would be a
good start.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have your substance and your focus
there, if you want to control the group
[SPEAKER_01]: from Germany, then Germany is your place
to be also for the holding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are based in the UK or if you
are based in, if you're originally from
[SPEAKER_01]: North Macedonia and you have a plant
there, not a problem to have the holding
[SPEAKER_01]: company there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've spoken to Zanya.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also groups that have their
holding companies offshore, not really,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in tax preferred countries like
Cyprus, Malta, and other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the Netherlands, we know,
have a rather low corporate tax rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the UK and Ireland have a low tax
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, tax can be a driver, but it doesn't
help you if your substance is somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: else because then it will put you into
trouble because then you may risk that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a permanent establishment abroad.
[SPEAKER_01]: If these are the two, so where is
substance and do you have a permanent
[SPEAKER_01]: establishment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fictitious permanent establishment abroad
may be the wrong one in another country.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will put you into tax trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and therefore, in this regard,
I can only advise substance, look at your
[SPEAKER_01]: organization, where are the people you
want to hire, what is an attractive
[SPEAKER_01]: market, what is maybe the first place for
your product rollout, and then put this
[SPEAKER_01]: all in a reasonable compliance regime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't stop with the regulatory filings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, include a corporate compliance
system because otherwise, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the journey, it's particularly
strict.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a compliance system,
you are committing an offense.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a manager and you're not
looking after the system, you can't say
[SPEAKER_01]: this by my minus two manager did that
mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm responsible for what's going on in the
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically, so we have a lot of
flexibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are the aspects I would put in
the center.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I add some color of comments on what
we also discussed just before that
[SPEAKER_05]: particular question with regards to
harmonization of EU regulatory frameworks
[SPEAKER_05]: and also what you mentioned, cross-border
trade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what we see already in the medical
market is that there is a product flow
[SPEAKER_05]: from Denmark to Germany, from Germany to
Poland, from Spain to Germany,
[SPEAKER_05]: from Portugal, the Netherlands,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have an existing cross-border trade
already.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, when talking to U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: folks, it's pretty exciting, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is also a huge opportunity and
chance when we're talking about the
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational system because harmonizing it
across Europe is probably crucial to make
[SPEAKER_05]: it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, we may end in a situation where
we have individual solutions and
[SPEAKER_05]: individual countries and this will
definitely not work out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time, it gives us already
in a existing medical world quite a taste
[SPEAKER_05]: of how a inner European ecosystem and
supply chains could look like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here I actually disagree a bit with
your statement that things are not
[SPEAKER_05]: transferable between territories.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe we already have in
pharmaceutical world quite a harmonized
[SPEAKER_05]: system.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I said, trade is possible and the joint
goal of the European Union should be to
[SPEAKER_05]: adapt that and adjust it and also make a
harmonized recreational system in the
[SPEAKER_05]: future possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to have a final question and
I want to leave a few minutes for
[SPEAKER_06]: questions from the audience here.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be an open question for
the panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about entering European market
by way of setting up a company.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about through investment?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any advice for folks looking
into Europe from other parts of the world
[SPEAKER_06]: that are considering entering the market
through a substantial investment into an
[SPEAKER_06]: existing or soon-to-be-launched cannabis
company in the European market?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's open for the group here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonja, anyone else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: About Spain, it would be about the
business to appeal for producing medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have already several companies
producing medical cannabis in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first company that started
producing medical cannabis in Spain is
[SPEAKER_00]: about seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have absolutely security to run your
business and now it has become more like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, the Spanish medical agency is
making it easier to get a license to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would it be a good idea to come to
Spain to produce cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a low cost of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, as everybody knows, an excellent
climate to out the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to remember that everyone has the
price electricity going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rapid approval process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opportunity for the first mover
advantage at the market is to open up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the most patients very soon and the market
has not grown at all yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the main requirements to grow it in
Spain, you need an LOI.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to sign an LOI with a medical
company to sell the product you grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you have to provide the seeds for
the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to work with certified clones for
seeds and just a security plan and an
[SPEAKER_00]: engineer project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you need in Spain to become a
cannabis medical producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything we could help you with?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe to add some ideas on how I would
look into a potential investment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would really look at what is the vision,
what is the team, what is the operational
[SPEAKER_05]: track record.
[SPEAKER_05]: If those three items somehow match
together and I would believe that this
[SPEAKER_05]: team is capable to really drive the
cannabis industry, then I would believe
[SPEAKER_05]: those are good indicators for a potential
investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just maybe to add, if you have an
international structure, if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: large player in the bank, it's easier to
invest because you can make use of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cost advantages of the expensive dollar at
the moment and you have a longer value
[SPEAKER_01]: chain, so you have more flexibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But another tip is only invest in what you
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the German market, generally the
market, that is a complex picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you invest, speak to other
investors, co-invest, invest with other
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller funds that have already been
invested in that company, ask them,
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the due diligence they have done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do your own due
diligence.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that, we'll leave a few questions
from the audience here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it for David, everybody.
Alright,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got your hand up right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please keep your questions to the first
four rows so I don't have to walk too far.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Ricardo from Akron Solistas in London.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a question regarding allegiance
between all European countries when it
[SPEAKER_03]: comes to recreation, which Benedict,
you were mentioning, I can see that
[SPEAKER_03]: happening for Germany because Germany has
got advanced medicinal specs, but don't
[SPEAKER_03]: you see there being a problem,
this is open to all the panel here,
[SPEAKER_03]: by having a recreational market in the
rest of Europe where their medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: market has yet to develop, don't we run
the risk of cannibalizing the medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: market with a recreational market?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my question.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'll actually take a shot at
that just because I think there are
[SPEAKER_06]: lessons to be learned from how we screw
things up in the United States in some
[SPEAKER_06]: respects.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll take it from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just having a conversation with a
new friend just maybe two hours ago when
[SPEAKER_06]: we were talking about how in the United
States there was a shift in focus from the
[SPEAKER_06]: medicinal market to the recreational
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's sensational in many respects,
and it's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been very excited about that and
still am, but there was something that was
[SPEAKER_06]: lost too, which was the medicinal
conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It got lost in the United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that in the States that obviously
legalized the recreational level.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is a significant loss because
there is so much technology that God put
[SPEAKER_06]: into this plant, and we really don't
understand it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you know, we're a bunch of
bio-science nerds, so we actually love
[SPEAKER_06]: that stuff and love hearing how this
stuff, not only alleviates the pain of
[SPEAKER_06]: cancer patients, for instance,
but actually may help fight cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that is just an amazing statement,
and we have to explore it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is a WTF sort of moment where you
realize we just forgot to really focus on
[SPEAKER_06]: that as a nation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would love to see things develop
differently here in Europe, where as you
[SPEAKER_06]: go to the recreational market,
it's great to be able to buy drinks and
[SPEAKER_06]: relax, but there is a danger, sir,
and I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a danger that the medical
conversation will be lost here as it was
[SPEAKER_06]: the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that would be very sad for the
whole world, because this plant can do
[SPEAKER_06]: much more than helping you relax.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for the opportunity to talk
about something that's screwed up in the U
[SPEAKER_06]: .S., and I hope our friends in Europe get
it more regularly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is, what is your advice for
Latin American markets to access European
[SPEAKER_01]: markets, and what is your vision on the
Latin American markets?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I take that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first of all, the question would be,
what is your business plan?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your business model?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to bring the ISU cannabis into
the German and European market?
[SPEAKER_05]: Then my question would be, do you want to
do everything on your own, meaning
[SPEAKER_05]: building your own assets, building your
own license sets, and to be an operational
[SPEAKER_05]: company in the target market or not?
[SPEAKER_05]: If the question is yes, build it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get the funds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get the team.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to go for a partnership,
go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to go for a commercial watch,
having someone that can actually enable
[SPEAKER_05]: your market access can take care of the
integrity stuff like distribution,
[SPEAKER_05]: storage, packaging, addressing the point
of sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some very good companies that
could help you and assist you and give you
[SPEAKER_05]: the room to market, and obviously this is
one key activity of one of our business
[SPEAKER_05]: units, so we're very much doing this as a
daily business.
One last one over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Stuart McKenzie from New Aquino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany, talking about the role in Germany
and how it's going to develop in the
[SPEAKER_02]: medical and also security world,
it's obviously a very big pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the pharmaceutical companies
doing to support our woodblocks,
[SPEAKER_02]: and when it does become from medical and
recreational work, what do you think the
[SPEAKER_02]: role of pharmaceutical companies will be?
[SPEAKER_02]: What can they do after it becomes
recreational and there's no need for the
[SPEAKER_02]: doctor to grow it?
[SPEAKER_05]: The exciting part of it is that most of
the companies in the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_05]: medical cannabis space are not big pharma
traditional companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably the leading companies,
they're not pharma companies from the
[SPEAKER_05]: background.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's actually just maybe one or let's
say two players in the German market that
[SPEAKER_05]: at least got some traction and have a pure
traditional pharma background.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I would look to our competitors in the
market, I would assume as long as this is
[SPEAKER_05]: a valuable, maybe profitable business,
why exiting it?
[SPEAKER_05]: My first statement would be that those
that are engaged in the medical market
[SPEAKER_05]: already without a pharma background or a
traditional pharma background,
[SPEAKER_05]: they will stay, and this is also something
if you look into other countries like
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada, many companies had a medical
background but not a traditional pharma
[SPEAKER_05]: background.
[SPEAKER_05]: They stayed, they added recreational
activities, and that's what I believe will
[SPEAKER_05]: also happen in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second part is maybe the further
traditional pharma companies are getting
[SPEAKER_05]: engaged in the market, seeing this
opportunity, but maybe not in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: much as the formulations, but rather with
very traditional finished products running
[SPEAKER_05]: through clinical trials, having a real
market authorization, but that's really
[SPEAKER_05]: the long-term game.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about years, we're talking
about IP protection, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: significant and heavy funds, and this is
probably the space where those traditional
[SPEAKER_05]: pharma companies have significant
advantages compared to other companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that are engaged in space.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can add, I think consolidation will
tell, so they will buy, as soon as this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry has developed, they will not try
to copy-paste business models,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they will unfold M&A activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for the whole panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
