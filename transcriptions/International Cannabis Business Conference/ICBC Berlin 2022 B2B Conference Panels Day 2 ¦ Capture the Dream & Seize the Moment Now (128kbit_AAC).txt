[SPEAKER_00]: It's right there to help companies start
getting licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were also the first state to allow
adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prop 64 regulate marijuana-like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We passed that in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: First stores opened January 1st,
2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost a decade ago that we've owned
recreational cannabis stores in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did everything go to shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's still awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have more jobs, less minorities in
prison, less problems, less alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've definitely learned some lessons
of what not to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 2014 then, seeing that the feds didn't
rate us, we started working in many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by 2014 with Canada, started
working there, then Germany, then Denmark,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now over 40 states, 40 countries we've
worked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been around seeing lots of
companies from cultivation to
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing to retail, the
internationals that have EUGMP compliance
[SPEAKER_00]: and GACP compared to state regulations in
Oklahoma, which let's just say some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: those aren't the best laws state by state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, blades of glory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two rivals that were skating and they got
in a fight, they got kicked out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Olympics in their class of skating,
male single skating, couldn't do it
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: One went out to be a burnout, the other
was tying some shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden they realized there
was a little change in the regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: that would allow them to compete in
another category, like paired finger
[SPEAKER_00]: skating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they launched to be the first male
paired figure skaters in the history of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world and got to get to the Olympics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one was like, you know, pretty boy,
Jimmy, the little blonde guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like raised to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see him as like the Canadian public
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I went to work and I know about M&As
and IPOs and all these valuations and it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be for a chicken farm or cannabis,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they came from the pedigree,
they were raised to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got these outlaws like Chas
Michael Michaels, who was pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous in doing whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are like the legacy operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like gangster power by any means
necessary, didn't have the resources and
[SPEAKER_00]: training, but they both do beautiful
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they bonded together to capture
the dream, which was a very beautiful kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of sentiment to go on and like actually
win the world Olympics as the first,
[SPEAKER_00]: not even ambiguously gay duo, but like
blatantly awesome duo of skating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at some of these
parallels, at least in my mind three
[SPEAKER_00]: months ago when they wanted this
presentation topic, it was like right now
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's just fricking dreaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dreams don't fucking happen unless you do
something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a great dream to do something,
you better read the rules about what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a team together, have a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because this is cannabis doesn't mean
you're going to be a millionaire or a
[SPEAKER_00]: billionaire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I see companies that do hundreds
of millions of revenue that are like
[SPEAKER_00]: losing money every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian public companies, MSOs,
all of those, and even private companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these different tax
regulations that you have to follow,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only in the United States where it's
federal and really illegal, we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: deduct our business costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our EBITDA should be like five million,
it's like one million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding all of these parameters,
you've got to dream, how to take a dream
[SPEAKER_00]: and a vision and make it something is what
I love to help companies do, but I see
[SPEAKER_00]: that most companies fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're always like dreaming,
I could do this or that, and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The focus for the companies is most
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at the global cannabis
market, and it's constantly evolving,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple more new colors there,
it's happening time by time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about the entire U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and global industry of legal cannabis last
year, about 35 billion U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars in revenue, when you think that
88% of that was in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is federally illegal, and state by
state, it's like we're almost different
[SPEAKER_00]: countries, you've got Canada doing 90% as
a legal medical and adult use industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: Interpol, nobody messed with them,
no one's messed with Uruguay yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest of the world,
this is all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical, adult use, less than 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even Germany last year,
almost 350 million in medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helping patients have less suffering,
healthcare's covering, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like testing the waters on a market,
but Colorado, six million people,
[SPEAKER_00]: close to three billion in revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, 90 million, like 350 million in
revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all people and things are gonna
start to change, especially as the rules
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rules start to allow the change,
but when you're in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: every little state is a country,
and I can't grow things in one place and
[SPEAKER_00]: move it to another, so it's super
inefficient, I have a different god or
[SPEAKER_00]: government I have to serve in each place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states will allow hundreds of
licenses, some will give five,
[SPEAKER_00]: but getting market share in these new
markets, just like international,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a real estate land grab, because it's
commonly for your site master files,
[SPEAKER_00]: or for your QAQC programs, you have to
have real estate that's compliant,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the owner will allow in a city that
said yes, that's not too close to a
[SPEAKER_00]: daycare or a church, that's gonna have to
have power and water and all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: different services, but real estate is one
of the secrets to finding these little
[SPEAKER_00]: places to go, because you can grow
cannabis anywhere, it's a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've grown cannabis in greenhouses all
the way up in Alaska, all the way down to
[SPEAKER_00]: South Africa, middle of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this anywhere, but how much is
it gonna cost you to do it somewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much environmental and social benefit
is gonna happen there, and what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: tax treaties and regulations between
countries, from where the money comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from, where the money goes, how you bank
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that are not as easy as
most people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the United States, from Wisconsin,
sorry, just in advance, not everyone in
[SPEAKER_00]: America is like you see on TV nowadays,
there's still some good ones left,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can still have women vote, they can
have credit cards still, there's still
[SPEAKER_00]: some things, gays can still get married,
we'll check in on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had that in four years, fingers
crossed, but with weed, no current federal
[SPEAKER_00]: bills, acts, attempts to do anything in
the United States are gonna pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's really good for stock prices when
it's like oh, the more acts move forward,
[SPEAKER_00]: great, not gonna fucking happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more acts, CARE, MACE, safe banking,
they're all needed, I'm not against any of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but right now we have such a divided
house, and when you think about the
[SPEAKER_00]: economy, language background, like economy
is oikonomos from Greece, like nomos are
[SPEAKER_00]: the rules of the laws, and oikos is the
house, so the rules that govern the house
[SPEAKER_00]: is like what economy is, and our economy
allows these little stay-right things,
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to the EU, but we don't have like
weird sanctions where if one state does
[SPEAKER_00]: something naughty, we're gonna like remove
them from swift banking or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be interesting, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're thinking about all these
states, and when it started with a few,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's only a few holdouts, we've got
over 1,000 bills nearly to legalize in
[SPEAKER_00]: different programs, it's gonna happen,
but we were the ones that caused the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: show around the world in the 30s with some
of our corporations that were paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: oil, cotton, they're the ones who kind of
worked together to make cannabis illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: just to go after hemp, which is,
we've only been able to do hemp in America
[SPEAKER_00]: since 2014, and that was a shit show of a
program the first few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But state by state, it's coming,
like California gonna do five billion in
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue this year, Colorado probably
three, Oregon, Washington a billion and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half each, some of these new states like
New York, New Jersey, Coronavirus,
[SPEAKER_00]: we went from 10 adult-use states to 20,
because they're like tax revenue jobs,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care, it's like this is gonna
bring in so much more new economy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's the right thing to do on a social
justice standpoint, but we've gotten to be
[SPEAKER_00]: guinea pigs in each one of these states,
different departments of agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: departments of health telling us what we
could do, what we couldn't do,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to figure out that right
there, but we already figured out what do
[SPEAKER_00]: people like, and there are people that are
different in Europe from the things you
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like you like good bread,
Americans don't like good bread because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not any good bread in the country,
I don't know how that is the case,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's different taste concerns in
countries, when it comes to, it's not just
[SPEAKER_00]: flour anymore, it's not just hash with
tobacco, but consumer packaged goods are
[SPEAKER_00]: changing the way that this industry is
going to be, it's gotta have a bar code,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the companies of ours here that do soil
to oil cultivation and manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: co-located, we don't sell wholesale
pounds, 500 kilos here, 500 kilos there,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's in a single one gram,
three and a half gram, seven gram package,
[SPEAKER_00]: every edible is child safe, and then
that's where you make the massive revenue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what you can learn from the United
States, what products are working and not,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to beverages and others,
what will your countries allow in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future, oh you're gonna do a giant vape
line in Europe, well Europe's based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: API and medical right now, other than the
Swiss Path program, you couldn't even do a
[SPEAKER_00]: product really, so you have to know those
rules and what you can do, so what can we
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from the United States and Canada,
long story there, to actually do this
[SPEAKER_00]: well, and like Jimmy, you'd say,
if you can dream it, you can do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: well that's not actually the case,
it takes tons of people to put this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: together, tens of millions of euros at
times to do this stuff, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes just to get started,
so when you think of what products worked
[SPEAKER_00]: in America, what's worked from
regulations, what pesticide testing
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging, what were the problems we had,
in a poll in Europe for adult use,
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest concern is about child access,
we've actually seen teen access go down,
[SPEAKER_00]: and consumption go down in illegal states,
because it's not cool anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in America, I could get shot from my
country, I could buy a house, have a gun,
[SPEAKER_00]: get married, pay taxes, smoke cigarettes,
buy porn, can't rent a car until you're
[SPEAKER_00]: 25, but you can't drink beer, alcohol,
or wine until you're 21, so then here it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like 18s difference, 16s difference for
beer, but drinking is so cool to teens in
[SPEAKER_00]: America, because they can't do it,
but then once it's like your parents are
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking weed, you're like, oh,
it's not that cool anymore, because my
[SPEAKER_00]: folks do it, but it still does happen,
so no matter what you do in Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good educational programs for youth
access, substance abuse education,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're an advocate in this industry,
you're no longer just like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a business, everyone looks at what
you do, from your packaging, your
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling, the messaging that you have for
this, who you support, from substance
[SPEAKER_00]: abuse education, the trainings that you're
gonna do, so, so important, also,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't need pesticides to produce this,
even if you don't have to follow a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard, if you do, like GMP or EUGMP,
or GACP for cultivation, you're already
[SPEAKER_00]: setting and doing all of this risk
mitigation, less risk is better for the
[SPEAKER_00]: investment, and you're higher likely to
succeed, so do the things, even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to do them right away,
because it will not limit you from selling
[SPEAKER_00]: to another market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I went over a little bit of
this the other day, but internationally,
[SPEAKER_00]: the big problem with international medical
cannabis, and as a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: patient myself, is that in the United
States, doctors write recommendations,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't write prescriptions for
cannabis, because that's through the FDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Food and Drug Administration,
they're a federal organization,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is federally illegal, the only
prescriptions that doctors can do there,
[SPEAKER_00]: for like Apodex, Sativex, Drenabinol,
Marinol, so it was that cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_00]: are all poisoned, but they write
recommendations, in some states,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not everything, California,
anything your doctor thinks cannabis can
[SPEAKER_00]: be helpful for, you can get a medical
card, like, I broke my wrist when I was 14
[SPEAKER_00]: skateboarding, it hurts, I can't sleep,
oh, here's your medical card, others,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, do you have a weird disease that I
can barely pronounce, and two doctors that
[SPEAKER_00]: say you have it, okay, now you can have
medical cannabis, but only 5% THC oil here
[SPEAKER_00]: or there, like each state's so,
so different, but we need doctor education
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world, we've been stigmatizing
this plant for so long, so no matter what
[SPEAKER_00]: you are, or where you are, don't ever,
like, go so flowery to sales, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cures this and that, like,
cannabis has been shown to, and we need a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more medical studies, and a big thing
that happened, through the Commission for
[SPEAKER_00]: Narcotic Drugs, the World Health
Organization, and the UN, the rescheduled
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in December of 2020, to be
similar to the US is schedule three,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, has medical value, needs more
research, in America, schedule one
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotic, we're heroin, cannabis is the
exact same, no medical needs, no more
[SPEAKER_00]: study needed, just the devil, so
internationally, cannabis isn't the devil
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore, it has medical efficacy,
needs more studies, if we change that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States, IRC-280E, that tax code
that really kills our industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: goes away overnight, because that's only
applicable to schedule one and schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: two narcotics, when you see that happen by
every single MSO that's in the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the United States, on a public company
standpoint, but we've gotta do education,
[SPEAKER_00]: we gotta get more doctors understanding
the needs for this, and trying this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and using this, that's why patient counts
are so, so low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adult use is starting, you know,
it's happening in Canada, happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: America, happening in Uruguay,
other places in Europe are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow this, why hasn't it happened yet?
And one of the big issues here,
standing in Germany, Deutschland,
biggest GDP in the EU, fucking awesome,
almost what, four trillion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty gangster, almost 90 million people,
like what you do here, Europe will follow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now that you're not competing with the
UK so much, like whole Brexit thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not gonna get into that,
but Germany, you have the ability to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like the trendsetter, like the prettiest
girl at the bar, if you figure this out
[SPEAKER_00]: right, are you going to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely not, okay, bummer,
it's not your fault, it's just who your
[SPEAKER_00]: parents are, AKA the EU, so we've got all
of these international drug compacts that
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Hoban and others talked about
yesterday, the single treaty in 1961 from
[SPEAKER_00]: the United Nations on Psychotropic
Substances, Indian Pharmacies Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these different things,
Canada's in blatant violation of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: Uruguay's in blatant violation of that,
all of the medical programs under those
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing compassionate use programs,
which means they can only be medical API,
[SPEAKER_00]: active pharmaceutical ingredients,
flour, oil, compounding happens in
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacies, you're not selling cookies or
vape cartridges, you know, you can do part
[SPEAKER_00]: A and part B standardization, but when we
think about what are all these things
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be, these are a lot of questions
that we typically try to figure out an
[SPEAKER_00]: answer, but the issue with Germany is that
you're in the EU, and the EU has different
[SPEAKER_00]: sanctions and provisions from member
nations, so you could pretty much do this
[SPEAKER_00]: to the EU, everyone's doing that right
now, no one's doing shit, minus Russia,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's a different thing, also very
unfortunate, but then you're also gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have to think of what's gonna happen not
only in your country, in some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cantons, like in Switzerland, or within
certain municipalities, and what's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, and the easiest way they see it to
do this is through the homegrown,
[SPEAKER_00]: which as a farmer, and being in this
space, some of these legal people should
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to grow it, are people gonna make
moonshine, yeah, are people gonna make
[SPEAKER_00]: extra beer in the salad, yeah,
is it gonna be significant, absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: not, it's gonna be like this much,
how many, you all could brew beer right
[SPEAKER_00]: now and brew wine, how many people have
carboids at home, wash those, put the
[SPEAKER_00]: priming sugar in, you know, yeah,
not many, but how many people had wine
[SPEAKER_00]: last night, we're lazy, cannabis,
it takes four to six months to grow it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you gotta dry it, you gotta cure it,
you got all those things, and it's great
[SPEAKER_00]: that people do it, and it's medicine,
you've been growing it, seeing a plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: helping that, I've seen that massively
helpful for veterans, but if we legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: it that way, it's gonna start a program of
more illicit market, and then it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be harder to rail that in later,
so if they do the right thing early,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna be very, very nice,
when we think about, I threw on the Team
[SPEAKER_00]: America world police on this one too,
like just, you know, America, but we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got stuff we gotta deal with with like the
United Nations, the Commission for
[SPEAKER_00]: Narcotic Drugs, the World Health
Organization, the EU, EU then with
[SPEAKER_00]: Europol, oh, we got Interpol, we got all
this money sitting up in London,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can't do shit right now, even though
they went and like raided and pillaged the
[SPEAKER_00]: world for like half a thousand years,
and then now have all this wealth sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: there that they can't actually invest into
like things because the Proceeds of
[SPEAKER_00]: Foreign Crimes Act from 2002, they can't
even invest into real estate in America,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we leased to a cannabis company,
so they can only invest certain proceeds
[SPEAKER_00]: into like other legal things that are
legal in their country, which is mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD type things, but when you think about
all these regulators and things you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to worry about, not that Team America's a
regulator, but you know, they like to act
[SPEAKER_00]: like it, but since we were the dickheads
that did this whole thing internationally,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not gonna be the first to say like,
we're sorry, cannabis should have never
[SPEAKER_00]: been illegal, we're gonna do this right,
we're gonna take the IP and companies will
[SPEAKER_00]: be leaders from the US in what they've
done, but we will be one of the latest to
[SPEAKER_00]: adopt this, and always that crystal ball
question, how many years until federal
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization in the United States,
five to nine years, I've been saying for
[SPEAKER_00]: five to nine years, and based on who our
last president was, which he shall not be
[SPEAKER_00]: named, nothing's gonna happen,
current administration, just a great bill
[SPEAKER_00]: from Biden the other day to actually like
take certain people out of jail,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not about not putting more new people
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: International Narcotics Control Board is
definitely pissed about everything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on, especially when it comes to like
all these vape cartridges, new
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, people doing isolates,
isolating something from nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: versus just like full distillates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you isolate something from nature and
you try to make an API, that's $562
[SPEAKER_00]: million of clinical trials to get a
standardized drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I took beta carotene out of a
carrot, and I was gonna make a supplement
[SPEAKER_00]: or something for that, or a pharmaceutical
drug, half a bill, just to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: so always use the word distillate,
not isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in this gray area where there's all
this new learning, all this new science,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's no regulators really cracking
down, other than on the blatantly illicit
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're thinking about what are the
possibilities in this place, are people
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna like weed in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be a whole different rollout
for how you live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're thinking 467 billion in 2022
in alcohol sales, that's almost half a
[SPEAKER_00]: trillion euros, and normally that'd be
like a lot more, but like the dollar and
[SPEAKER_00]: the euro, about the same right now,
which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome for us, sorry for you,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally that'd be like, oh god,
467 billion euros, oh my god, it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: $650 million, oh my god, it's the same
now, but that's a huge market share,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's not something that's poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We allow alcohol, but we don't allow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody seen a drunk person and a stoned
person?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not saying one's better than the other,
but damn, the problems that alcohol causes
[SPEAKER_00]: to society over what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, like helps to treat and make
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol, and then you've got tobacco,
almost a quarter trillion dollars a year,
[SPEAKER_00]: and smoking's cool here, it's not in
America anymore, it's really a bummer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like all these new things,
Juul got banned by the FDA, like those
[SPEAKER_00]: little vape cartridge type things,
like tobacco is still this weird thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It built our country, but also like kind
of killing the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about this market share and
what's happened in Colorado, most of our
[SPEAKER_00]: data, and there's a lot of data companies
out there, but long term we project that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be one billion in revenue
from every million people for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for every dollar spent on cannabis,
there's about five dollars of velocity of
[SPEAKER_00]: capital, the real estate, the consulting,
the legal, the packaging, the electricity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plumbers putting in things,
like manufacturers in China, like you buy
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, you're contributing to this
whole other industry, so even if we say
Colorado's doing three billion in revenue,
we're probably doing like 12 billion of
additional economy, 15 billion.
What would that look like here,
because the latest that cannabis exists
[SPEAKER_00]: here, now, it's just not being taxed,
tested, regulated, that's what creates the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive opportunities will be the second
largest adult use market in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: within five to 10 years, closer to the 10
year side.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about things, Gianna,
for some slide, but the EU with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical, it's really been happening well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal did something awesome by
decriminalizing drugs back in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only did it allow you to buy a lot of
fake drugs in Lisbon on accident,
[SPEAKER_00]: happens whenever there's like,
people think that drugs are legalized,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's a big difference between
decriminalization, legalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: rescheduling, descheduling, but the
medical programs have been starting here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but mostly have let you down as businesses
because we don't have tons of doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: writing prescriptions all over the place
that create the massive fucking demand
[SPEAKER_00]: that we need to actually fuel these
businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why Canopy, Aurora, all of these
companies that we need to take over the
[SPEAKER_00]: globe, same time we were working,
they spent so much money on things that
[SPEAKER_00]: thought they would generate revenues and
returns two, three years out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were all four to seven to 10 year
plans, and they just got burned like short
[SPEAKER_00]: squeezes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about that adult use in
Europe, kind of awesome, you got the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands coffee house thing since the
70s, that's gone through many iterations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not actually even legal for
non-residents to purchase there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to the Dutch though,
because without them and their breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the 70s, we wouldn't have a lot of
the genetics that we have, and it's sad to
[SPEAKER_00]: see those companies aren't massively
profitable like Driscoll's right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they didn't do brand licensing and
genetics breeding rate stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Netherlands had their program and
has the program and the wheat experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: to allow 10 to produce for 78 coffee
houses, a few more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's over 500 coffee houses in the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one on average does 1.7 million rows
a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, pretty significant in a country
that's not legal for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain has their club model with the
medical club model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, gray area ambiguity, it's
proliferating, it's starting more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luxembourg introduced full legalization,
all of that's gotten shot down and how
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, how we're going to do it,
awesome, but way to go auto, way to go
[SPEAKER_00]: greens, the social template.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone who kind of made that happen,
fucking gangster, to say that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised Germany was first,
I figured Malta would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just the big one everyone's going
to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal is not legalized, it's
decriminalized, and that's all drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've had so fewer drug problems with
all drugs in their country, because they
treat it as an illness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help people instead of put them in
prison, take away their children.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good model of drug control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malta's got that under books, and
Switzerland has this pilot program for
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,000 patients, people to consume in
little club settings, but they allow
[SPEAKER_00]: products, not just flour and oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing in the Netherlands,
the wheat experiment, it was only flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have the Edibles plan yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to do Netherlands 1.0,
2.0, similar to Canada, but these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: countries to really look at and pull
things that work from some of the others,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Germany's got a lot of work ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get into this thing, if you want to
capture the dream, you've got to know the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules to play the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of reading to do in a lot of
languages, but the main thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you wouldn't go to a casino with a million
dollars and go play blackjack if you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't understand the rules, or how you
would double down on things, or I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: gamble, it's a tax on people that are bad
at math, but you wouldn't go and put a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of money down and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, gambling legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of crazy to me too, and gambling
hates cannabis, because we don't make good
[SPEAKER_00]: gamblers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get distracted and we're not like,
yeah baby, we're going to get hammered.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why there's been so many problems
in Las Vegas getting this legal on the
[SPEAKER_00]: strip, but when you know the rules of
what's the law allow, what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: standards I have to follow, what are the
outside industry things that I need,
[SPEAKER_00]: can I even do my business plan where I'm
thinking about doing that business plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this country allow it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you have the idea that you're
going to get an extraction license in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal and make vape pens and sell them
all over the world, well, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: going to happen, unless it's a medical
device compounded and so forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's always from almost Hindi
mythology, you have multiple different
[SPEAKER_00]: gods and you got to serve them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just like Christian Santa Claus
God, just one dude, keep him happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got national, international law,
your federal, your state or country,
[SPEAKER_00]: municipalities or counties, all the way
down to little burros and burgermeisters,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's got to be compliant, top down,
bottom up, and that's not just cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing I see, having done
thousands of applications and businesses,
[SPEAKER_00]: winning the licenses, I focus on because
it's number one, but getting a license to
[SPEAKER_00]: a building permit, a certificate of
occupancy and starting the business,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's capital raising, pre-construction,
site planning, engineering, expensive and
[SPEAKER_00]: time, and little things now, coronavirus
has changed so many things for supply
[SPEAKER_00]: chains, everything you're going to do is
going to right now be two times as much
[SPEAKER_00]: money and take twice as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, we used to just do new
buildings for everything, but retrofits
[SPEAKER_00]: are really starting to be much more
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis stocks are as low as they've
ever been right now, some of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: undervalued, some of them are still
overvalued, but on a public or private
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint, this industry, we're out of
gas, even though we're doing 35 billion in
[SPEAKER_00]: rev and all of the services.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get traditional bank loans,
I can't get other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we don't have institutional
capital, how you raise private capital,
[SPEAKER_00]: how you deal with public capital,
we manage funds, do a lot of SPVs,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've seen over a billion dollars of
capital deployed in this space,
[SPEAKER_00]: some good, some bad, but now more than
ever, if you're thinking about getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into this, starting a business,
we have a very short timeline,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's within the next 10 years that this
is all established.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever gets those first early market
positions, those are the ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the exits that we hope for.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them will stop though,
costs are really high, we have weird tax
[SPEAKER_00]: provisions, people are trying to figure
out R&D and things on things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: already known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big advice, just like Bob said,
this is an agricultural commodity,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a value-added product from
consumer packaged goods, supplements,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't just think you're reinventing the
wheel on everything, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with some amazing new way of
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fucking Dutch with their greenhouses
and the Venlo's have figured all this out
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use their technology, don't develop a new
LED light that you think is going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this magic shit, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture, been around for like what,
10,000ish years, been working pretty well
[SPEAKER_00]: for us, pull from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor, I've been trying to put indoor out
of business for over a decade,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so environmentally catastrophic,
it's cheaper to build big four season
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid greenhouses that can still be GAZP
and GMP and outdoors where all oil will
[SPEAKER_00]: come from in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of due diligence is needed,
if you're an investor or an operator,
[SPEAKER_00]: do your homework before you jump into
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, you will be lost and all of
your dreams will not happen, there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: nightmares and you'll work at McDonald's
someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got more startups than we've ever
seen, they're failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many new companies are here this year
that weren't here last year or the year
[SPEAKER_00]: before that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to really be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you've got these companies going
public and thinking they're going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: over the world, be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can write a good press release and
that's where we are right now in publics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true value, but remember a lot
of those dominate market share and you got
[SPEAKER_00]: new IPOs that are happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp, just the last thing, don't go play
with the woodland fairies after he was
[SPEAKER_00]: kicked out of the Olympics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Delta 8, that's CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Novel cannabinoid right now, hemp,
there's industrial hemp and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: novel cannabinoid extraction, almost a $2
billion side in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is a very good medicinal compound,
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90-95% snake oil garbage industry being
sold in gas stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once hemp didn't make them billions of
dollars and then CBD market bottomed out,
[SPEAKER_00]: what new cannabinoid can I do with this
license?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Delta 8, Delta 9, THCV, all these
others, they'll all be scheduled similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to heroin in the United States in this
next year, even though some farm bill
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just jump on random bandwagons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Main thing, just got to show a panda at
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you practice and you do your fucking
homework, you have the possibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: capturing the dream, but in this room,
you've got less than 1% chance of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's here, left, right of you,
don't want by people, look them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: eye, your partners, your future investors,
they're all here and we're in this
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have so long to put this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right before this whole industry is pretty
much dominated by a bunch of shitbag
[SPEAKER_00]: assholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Philip Morris, all the others,
they're going to buy a lot of our
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great, but if we embed good ethos
into the company now, we can literally
[SPEAKER_00]: change the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most important thing we can be
doing with our lifetime, with your
[SPEAKER_00]: capital, with your money, with your minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is boring and established,
but this is revolutionary, what we get to
[SPEAKER_00]: do at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
