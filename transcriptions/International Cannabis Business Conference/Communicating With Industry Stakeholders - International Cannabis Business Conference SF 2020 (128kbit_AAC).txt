[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to run down our panel here
and do a little quick introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: To my immediate left, Tara Carver,
Jared Kylo, Rebecca Ferre, and Ruben
[SPEAKER_00]: Honig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to start us off, and this is my maiden
voyage here as a panel moderator,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was told my first question was
terrible, so I'm gonna cross that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would like to sort of just go down
the row and have everyone have a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of give their background,
where they're from, and how long they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been involved in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys all hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Alex, and I'm excited to be up
here with the three of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Tara Carver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the executive director of the Humboldt
County Growers Alliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We represent 250 plant-touching members.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority of them are cultivators
or farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have manufacturers,
retailers, distributors, testing labs in
[SPEAKER_01]: our ranks as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come from the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a cannabis farmer by trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I became a policy wonk by necessity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization kind of blew through
Humboldt, and we all had to really step
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we think about communication,
we didn't think about communication,
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was brought up in an era of the less
communication, the better, because you
[SPEAKER_01]: stayed safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've swung the pendulum on this
whole legalization thing and having to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually talk about what we do and what
regulation does and how it impacts us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I probably have the least amount of
experience in communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've found that if you have fun with
it, it actually works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far, we've been pretty successful
in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm here to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Tara.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Jared Kylo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the president of the United Cannabis
Business Association.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are a trade organization comprised
mostly of retailers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like a lot of retailers, there are
quite a lot of other points inside the
[SPEAKER_04]: supply chain that they take on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we definitely prioritize and wear the
hat of retailers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the work that I've done,
I started here in San Francisco about 18
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's nice to still be in my hometown
and still doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do operate in Los Angeles quite a
bit, which I enjoy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I definitely enjoy coming home and
also being a part of this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, communications has been the
biggest part of a retailer because we had
[SPEAKER_04]: a green cross on a street for quite a few
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get the opportunity to hide.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I sat on the medical marijuana
task force here under Gavin Newsome years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago, and it was awesome to have someone
who believed in us enough to give us a
[SPEAKER_04]: space inside of City Hall to actually have
communication, have public hearings,
[SPEAKER_04]: and really try to go through really good
standard operating procedures and give
[SPEAKER_04]: best business practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a way that we got to
communicate to our, you know, to our
[SPEAKER_04]: regulators.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got to tell them what was needed
and what the best business practices were
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be and having subcommittees.
[SPEAKER_04]: That communication has been, you know,
pivotal in being able to run a trade
[SPEAKER_04]: organization because now I had the
foundation of how you can communicate with
[SPEAKER_04]: a kind of a legislator that really wants
to listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it seems like ever since then,
we've kind of been pushing an agenda to
[SPEAKER_04]: try to make sure people listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is now an opportunity where
everyone is here trying to find out what
[SPEAKER_04]: the stakeholders and legacy operators have
done over years and how do we protect that
[SPEAKER_04]: legacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just appreciate the opportunity to
continue to communicate to people and
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to get our message across.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for the opportunity of this
panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Rebecca Ferre.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the communications manager for the
California Department of Food and
[SPEAKER_02]: Agriculture's Cal Cannabis Cultivation
Licensing Division, one of the longest
[SPEAKER_02]: titles I've ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a business card.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I was employee number six or so
for the Cal Cannabis Division.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been here from the beginning,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we license the cannabis farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our job.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are here to help them get through the
licensing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it's not easy, as Lori mentioned
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a process we're constantly reviewing
and trying to improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stakeholder feedback we get is so
helpful to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: As of this morning, I just thought I would
share that we have licensed 5,214 cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're down to about 600 pending
applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've made a lot of progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I came to Cal Cannabis,
I worked in the Senate as a communications
[SPEAKER_02]: director in public policy on many areas,
including agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I worked at the Sierra Club and as
communications director of companies,
[SPEAKER_02]: divisions of Amazon.com and book
publishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a long communications
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this has been one of the most
exciting, constantly changing
[SPEAKER_02]: communications positions I think that Alex
and I have probably been in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's just that the ground is
always moving and the laws are changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to keep up just as much
as everybody else is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Ruben Honig.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am co-founder of Sierra Strategies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a consulting firm that has been
around since 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been in the industry for five
years, originally moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from Massachusetts originally,
but moving from Florida five, six years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually five years this past
December for actually safe access as a
[SPEAKER_03]: medical patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So originally got into the industry with
extreme concerns that people weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: getting in other states or California.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I moved to California, where they have
had a very longstanding medical program,
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of stepped into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then looking at other states,
seeing that there wasn't that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: access and people really needing to figure
that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember going to dispensaries when
I just showed up in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know Jared spoke about this,
about dispensaries kind of being the front
[SPEAKER_03]: line and communicating with patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started to see how butt tenders,
how people were actually communicating
[SPEAKER_03]: with people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people I would see would come into a
dispensary and say, this was my wife has
[SPEAKER_03]: stage four cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our last opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the last thing that we can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do we do?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was kind of this,
depending on who you speak to,
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on who you do, who you're
getting advice from, it wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: standardized, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do more work on local licensing policy
work at the state, locally in the city of
[SPEAKER_03]: Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm based in LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have done a lot of trade associations.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trade association work where
communication is key, communicating with
[SPEAKER_03]: policymakers, communicating internally
with membership.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate this conference and our
moderator, Alex Traverso.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was given the leeway to select what
the panel was going to be, who was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be on this panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so obviously I picked the people that
I am a fan of their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that they all represent sort
of an interesting, they all come from
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting backgrounds and they all have
to communicate with different audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as I think a lot of us know,
the way you reach a grower versus a
[SPEAKER_00]: retailer versus just a general
stakeholder, there's many different
[SPEAKER_00]: tactics, many different ways of
communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm really interested in just kind
of hearing some of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges that we all sort of face in our
day to day lives and trying to communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: with folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I think as much as I want this
to be sort of freewheeling and everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: jump in where they can, I think I want to
start with Jared on this one just because
[SPEAKER_00]: he's not only a business owner,
but he does represent a trade association.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there are different challenges
that come with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll let you take it away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, when we're trying to deal
with a market that is now transitioning,
[SPEAKER_04]: you went from absolutely no regulations
and the attempt to hide.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now when you transition to probably
the most regulated product that we can
[SPEAKER_04]: think of now in California, trying to get
those people to transition has been one of
[SPEAKER_04]: the most difficult parts because they're
trying to keep their business going.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to understand OSHA
certifications.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to make sure that they did
the sexual harassment studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we've got all of these things to
think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I come in as the president of
this organization talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations, possible labor unions,
what labor peace agreements are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is overwhelming for most to even
try to hear all the things that we have to
[SPEAKER_04]: transition to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you try to give them a safe
place to say, OK, how can I boil this down
[SPEAKER_04]: to what your biggest needs are and how do
you create priorities?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, our organization has done a good job
of keeping three or four priorities at the
[SPEAKER_04]: top of our listing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to deal with these first before we
move on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's been a great way of
communicating to people who feel like
[SPEAKER_04]: they're frazzled by all the information
they need to absorb.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they start to look at how much
they're spending on legal counsel and on
[SPEAKER_04]: consulting fees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so trying to be a trade organization
that funnels all that information,
[SPEAKER_04]: lowers those costs and reduces those
barriers because I'm sitting in a seat
[SPEAKER_04]: that says, I have the exact same issues
you do as a retailer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also have to survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the things I'm doing as a
retailer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you sit in a room of everyone
having the same needs, a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation from that is what really
builds up kind of a community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I really wanted in Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being in Northern California, community
was just how you lived.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you didn't have people come and
trim at your grow up unless you knew them
[SPEAKER_04]: or they were a friend of a friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so trying to establish that Northern
California style of community in Southern
[SPEAKER_04]: California was a little difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's like, what are you doing here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you in Los Angeles?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, but what are you doing here?
[SPEAKER_04]: We usually fight with each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are we going to love each other?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realize that that may sound a little
bit soft and like, you know, but the point
[SPEAKER_04]: is we all want to feel comfort with each
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so being in a group and allowing each
other to express each other's needs and
[SPEAKER_04]: then offering possible solutions has been
what this group has why we've stayed
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we spent millions of dollars
passing an ordinance in the city of Los
[SPEAKER_04]: Angeles, Measure M.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like as a trade organization,
trying to get people to pull millions of
[SPEAKER_04]: dollars out of their pockets, telling them
that this is the pathway to their future
[SPEAKER_04]: success is not an easy conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Explaining how to get 109,000 signatures
to qualify an ordinance in the city of LA
[SPEAKER_04]: is not something that most people
understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's been the hardest part about
running an organization of transitional
[SPEAKER_04]: business owners was how do I prioritize
what is most important to them?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I allocate their resources and
funds to the most important parts and
[SPEAKER_04]: really transition them into a space where
they feel comfortable and putting that
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of publicity out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of my members wanted to hide for the
first five and six years of being in this
[SPEAKER_04]: organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do you get them to come out of the
shadows and really stand up for their
[SPEAKER_04]: business, stand up for their industry,
and also stand up for their community that
[SPEAKER_04]: we built?
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that we have this nice community,
we feel there's a sense of comfort.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once that comfort's there, now we try to
go, okay, here's the hard questions we
[SPEAKER_04]: have to answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the things that you're going to
have to consider again today?
[SPEAKER_04]: What labor unions do you really want to
work with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which ones do you think are going to
represent your needs the best?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not easy to talk about politics
in front of a group of people who have
[SPEAKER_04]: never voted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's sometimes a problem,
too, because we stayed out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: limelight for so many years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then to expect all of these people to
engage fully has been a really difficult
[SPEAKER_04]: process.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we're in a place now where
people are proud of the work they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're proud to tell their parents and
everyone that they own a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have to hide anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, when people used to ask me what
I did, I used to tell them, everything
[SPEAKER_04]: else but cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's like the first thing I say
when some people say, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I'm proud of the cannabis work
I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm proud to be in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think what happened now is that
communication of pride is what's really
[SPEAKER_04]: pushing a lot of my members to be out
there, to go hit the streets, and make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure their neighborhood councils
understand the good work they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is truly what did this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pride and ownership of a legal industry
and feeling like you don't have to look
[SPEAKER_04]: over your shoulders wondering when the
police are going to come back,
[SPEAKER_04]: that has changed the view of a lot of
people inside the retail space.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been the front lines for a lot
because in Humboldt, it was helicopters.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Los Angeles, it was any time a police
officer drove by, everyone clenched up,
[SPEAKER_04]: because you never knew if you were going
to be subjective to them coming into your
[SPEAKER_04]: shop, whether you thought you were legal
or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop D in Los Angeles was a mess and left
everyone in this gray area for such a long
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now to feel like we're supported by our
city, to feel like we're supported by our
[SPEAKER_04]: state, and also to see the country move,
that communication has become so much
[SPEAKER_04]: easier because I don't have to convince
people that we have something good to
[SPEAKER_04]: build from.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's being built right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these regulations have really helped.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's probably the best thing I can
say about the communications now style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a question specific to growers
that I want to ask, but I took cold
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine before I came here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a question that I want to ask
Ruben that I'm going to forget if I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: ask him really quickly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is really more about if
you have clients that you're representing,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I think based on the state of
the industry and where we're at right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: that things are a little difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Communication can sometimes be a nice to
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering, what do you tell a
client who maybe doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources to bring on communication
strategy or a communicator?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how do you advise them to sort of
do that work on their own?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you take day quill or night quill?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's daytime, so I took the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know any other way to say
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're dealing with an unprecedented
landscape where, well, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: the communications side, I don't
necessarily see the value right now for
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the business side, there are so many
things that businesses, as we're seeing,
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry is kind of contracting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing a lot of layoffs in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing a lot of issues going on now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're seeing a lot of successes at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's easy to lament and really
pile on and say, oh, everything is
[SPEAKER_03]: horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a crisis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the worst.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all going to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: But going out there and talking to people,
there's a lot of stories out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that aren't
putting out press releases when they raise
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not saying, oh, I have $100
million.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have $200 million.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're quietly building their businesses
one, two, three steps at a time and not
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily getting ahead of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Communicating with local government is
complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, as we probably all know here,
there is a shortage of license
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries across the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are areas that don't have them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do see a lot of dispensaries in bigger
municipal areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, on the other side of that coin,
we're seeing that those stores,
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on levels of enforcement,
and levels of taxation and different
[SPEAKER_03]: inputs, we're seeing stores barely touch
the outer realm of their capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unfortunate to see people not wanting
to go to stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Los Angeles has a great
opportunity to communicate with the
[SPEAKER_03]: public.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through public education, we have seen
weed-wise at the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: The city of Los Angeles still has $750,000
sitting inside of some sort of... Thank
[SPEAKER_03]: you for that campaign plug, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you a plug all day every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: When are we going to communicate more
effectively with the consumer,
[SPEAKER_03]: with the public?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm on my own island all the way
over here, but I think that there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: large majority of people that think since
Prop 64 passed, everything is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that segues into the question for
how to communicate with growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get Tara's thought on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I want to talk to Rebecca a little
bit about that as well, because Cal
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has its own PR campaign that is
focused on reaching cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as easy as potentially the one
that we're talking about with weed-wise
[SPEAKER_00]: and reaching retailers, because there's so
much more out in the forefront of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking to growers, I think the Humboldt
County Growers Alliance does a great job
[SPEAKER_00]: in their communications, member
appreciation, communication posts are
[SPEAKER_00]: always fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt County has a long history,
60 plus years of rebel, outrageous,
[SPEAKER_01]: outlaw, cannabis farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very prideful of our work,
but being a rebel, outrageous,
[SPEAKER_01]: loud, cannabis farmer now, I have found we
have to tone it back a little bit when
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking to the policy makers.
[SPEAKER_01]: My struggle sometimes with communication
is taking my amazing membership and all
[SPEAKER_01]: their outrageous stories and asking them
to be very professional when you go in and
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to your local government about
taxes instead of coming in with protest
[SPEAKER_01]: signs and banging down the door and
locking yourself to the chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had to rearrange a bit of our
strategy, but I guess when I think about
[SPEAKER_01]: growers and communicating with growers
from heritage regions in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: humor is the best way to get a message
across.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, again, because we can be so
serious and outrageous and loud,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you can tone it down with a little bit
of humor, it really makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: communication style very personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to think of our members,
they're very passionate, they're artists.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can communicate to them on a level
of basic humanity, they respond really
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been my trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's great, because that's
ordinarily what I would shoot for as well
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Bureau, is sort of a fun
conversational style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the state kind of frowns
upon that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have too much fun, because it's
not approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to hear Rebecca's perspective,
because I know she feels my pain on a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular basis as well, so getting her
perspective on the regulator side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things and maybe talking a little bit
about the campaign that you guys have with
[SPEAKER_00]: Food and Ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an industry awareness campaign
that is going to unroll very soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be an announcement in a few weeks
where we're going to talk about the merits
[SPEAKER_02]: of being a licensed cannabis farmer in the
state and talking to other farmers who are
[SPEAKER_02]: licensed who will share their stories up
and down the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been working very hard on that,
and we're looking forward to launching
[SPEAKER_02]: that soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to add that Alex and I are always
on the front lines of working with the
[SPEAKER_02]: reporters who do a really good job of
keeping on top of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a demanding beat covering cannabis,
but as former journalists and reporters,
[SPEAKER_02]: we also know the importance of getting
back to people really quickly,
[SPEAKER_02]: finding information that's needed so that
everybody out there can get the latest
[SPEAKER_02]: breaking news.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also had surveys at the Department
of Food and Ag asking farmers,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do you want to get your information?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the best way to get it to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Social media has been very popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have now at Food and Ag, we have an
Instagram channel, which Food and Ag just
[SPEAKER_02]: celebrated its 100th anniversary last
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: They never had an Instagram channel,
but the cannabis farmers said they love to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the beautiful photographs of their
plants, and so we added Instagram to that
[SPEAKER_02]: collection of social media channels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we also recently added a Twitter
Espanol channel, and we have a bilingual
[SPEAKER_02]: person on staff to reach out to some of
the Spanish farmers, and we've been doing
[SPEAKER_02]: more with Hmong farmers as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's from the stakeholder
feedback that we've been getting,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we really do listen to the feedback
that we get from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of material we put out for
people to read, FAQs, fact sheets,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not everybody is a reader,
so we're also doing more short videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing podcasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing more photo essays and things
like that, so we do listen to how people
[SPEAKER_02]: want their information, and we do radio
talk shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do news shows on television,
and we just try all avenues to get out
[SPEAKER_02]: there and get the message heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking about feedback in your
communications and maybe some things that
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our realm at the BCC, I've been at this
for a little over three years now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we set up our social media
channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think initially when we started out,
the general feeling was we're getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit of the doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wait and see how this thing rolls
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the course of three years,
I think the tide has turned a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of speaking about challenges and
some of the feedback you receive in your
[SPEAKER_00]: communications, I think one thing that
stuck out to me the other day,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I read everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see everything that people comment on
our posts and things we put out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody just said, you've got to hand it
to the BCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They continue to put this shit out even
though everyone's killing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting lit up on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything we put out there, you're
terrible people, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the challenges we deal with on a
regular basis because you have to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to put information out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just go dark because you're
getting this negative feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to just run down the panel and
talk about some of the feedback you've
[SPEAKER_00]: received, some of the feedback,
good or bad, that you've received in your
[SPEAKER_00]: communications programs, and maybe some of
the challenges that you just face on a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can all agree that the input of
information that we have to turn around
[SPEAKER_01]: and churn out is a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's the BCC, Cal Cannabis,
other trade associations, news articles,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a constant move.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, we're a scrappy grassroots
organization and we don't have a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: billion dollar, million, trillion,
zero budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three of us, and one of our
biggest challenges has actually come down
[SPEAKER_01]: to finding a graphic designer who's not in
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning that we can't get a graphic
designer to be able to be on call.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing this for three,
three and a half years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started local, and then we outsourced
to San Francisco, and then we outsourced
[SPEAKER_01]: to New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: We literally have a gentleman in Serbia
right now turning over our graphic design
[SPEAKER_01]: work because I can't find one in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some things to say on this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making connections right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alexia is going to be really bummed.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nonetheless, turning over that
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can't get the Instagram post,
because that's how our rural farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate, and thank you so much for
hearing us on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been such a big deal for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can't get that Instagram post out
within 48 hours, sometimes a policy will
[SPEAKER_01]: change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've paid for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not relevant anymore, and I have to
go pay for it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had issues that have changed so
rapidly that I've had three posts that are
[SPEAKER_01]: all worthless.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our biggest issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was interesting because we
stood out really quickly in Los Angeles in
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to make regulations legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dealing with that gray area for such a few
years, quite a few years, we kind of went
[SPEAKER_04]: like, okay, we're going to jump out and
make this happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wrote an ordinance, and immediately as
soon as we wrote an ordinance,
[SPEAKER_04]: we were the target of just about everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were called monopolistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were called deeply entrenched and
trying to make sure that no one else could
[SPEAKER_04]: enter the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens is when you stick your neck
out, everyone loves to point a finger that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're the bad guy, you're the bad girl,
you're the one who's come out here and
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to take over the industry with your
words, and your ballot measures.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was initially how we got started.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing was like, wow,
here's a 53 page ballot initiative in the
[SPEAKER_04]: city of Los Angeles, and we're being
called monopolistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just trying to make sure that the
legal part of this industry continues to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even to today, even when we have a retail
expansion bill that we've been trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: run this year, we're still being called
monopolistic as an organization because we
[SPEAKER_04]: represent a small sector section of
license holders inside the retail segment.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thought is that we're not trying to
grow this industry because we want it all
[SPEAKER_04]: for ourselves, which is, it's a difficult
part to have to try to communicate to
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to be monopolistic when you have
a dispensary in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I really taking over the Northern
California market with my dispensary in
[SPEAKER_04]: LA?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the communication is like,
I really only have reach about five or six
[SPEAKER_04]: miles from the center of my dispensary,
so how can I be monopolistic?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the thing is, with this kind of
communication style, people love to break
[SPEAKER_04]: you down and say that you're bad so they
can elevate themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to elevate yourself above that
chatter, because in the positions we're
[SPEAKER_04]: in, elevating yourself over people who are
trying to just hate on the work that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're doing, you can't just dive into
that every time and lose sleep over the
[SPEAKER_04]: fact that people don't like you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to stay focused.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to keep your group focused.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever someone says something negative
about you, you need to take it in and see
[SPEAKER_04]: if that's true, and if it doesn't feel
true to you, you have to shed it off and
[SPEAKER_04]: not feel like you have to continue to
answer that same negative feedback.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been the biggest challenge for us,
especially in Los Angeles, is to really
[SPEAKER_04]: take that negative feedback and push it
out and really just try to be productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tara, I wanted to let you know that we
have a lot of free graphic artists
[SPEAKER_02]: responding on our Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting very creative with emojis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They communicate very well what they're
not happy about with sometimes R-rated
[SPEAKER_02]: emojis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have a lot of fun looking at
those, but we want to hear the good and
[SPEAKER_02]: the bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to get all the feedback because we
do go back and figure out, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of people aren't liking this.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we make it better?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we change it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The change takes a while sometimes,
but we are listening and we always welcome
[SPEAKER_02]: the feedback, whether it's on social
media, or calling Food and Ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a toll-free 1-833-CALGROW phone
number.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do invite that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate talking to the stakeholders,
and I just want to throw out also some
[SPEAKER_02]: people just like to have one-on-one
conversations with the experts in
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing, and thanks to my partners at
Fish and Wildlife who are here today and
[SPEAKER_02]: the water boards, we are doing about a
dozen free cultivation licensing workshops
[SPEAKER_02]: across the state just for the first half
of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will have more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tried doing online workshops.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do another one on February
21st, and that allows people in remote
[SPEAKER_02]: areas to also look at, maybe they can't
make it to LA or San Francisco or some
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of Humboldt, wherever we might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying this, and it was very
effective the first time, so we're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of this is posted on our social
media, and it's on our online calendar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can plan accordingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do welcome the feedback,
good and bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for everybody's comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: You left me at the end, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that one thing I wanted to
bring up is, and this actually was
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting, in another trade association,
the LA Cannabis Task Force, that I helped
[SPEAKER_03]: found and really kind of got to know the
ins and outs of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to know the ins and outs of LA local
policy, some state policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I learned many years ago,
which is in cannabis years, not in human
[SPEAKER_03]: years, but you need to communicate with
the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that you communicate with the
state is different than the way you
[SPEAKER_03]: communicate with the city of Los Angeles
is different than you communicate with the
[SPEAKER_03]: city of San Diego than you communicate
with San Jose.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got into a position where we placed in
our article or had some quotes that were a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit inflammatory in the city of Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you do stuff like that,
then the council member just cuts you off.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, we're not talking to you
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the state, we were, with my former
business partner, she came from the state,
[SPEAKER_03]: and she was more aggressive with kind of
her positioning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was almost like, oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: These people are being babies.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, you have to be very
conscious of your audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is very, very easy to make a
communication snafu and people are
[SPEAKER_03]: sensitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are emotional.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis industry, I think it's tough
right now because when you're in it every
[SPEAKER_03]: single day and you're working in the
industry, be it ancillary, licensees,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's hard to kind of take a step back and
see perspective of, well, if I care so
[SPEAKER_03]: much about this, do the people at the
state care as much as I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think to your point, I think all of
us on a regular basis are so sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: entrenched in what we're doing that
sometimes there are opportunities out
[SPEAKER_00]: there for different tactics or different
ways of doing things that we may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to capitalize on, utilize,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And case in point, a couple weeks ago,
we were at a different event and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: a regulator from Oregon there and they
were talking about they have a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my boss afterward comes to me and
says, well, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we do, we had a California podcast
and I was like, are you serious?
[SPEAKER_00]: When that thing goes through the editing
and the review process, it'd be like a
[SPEAKER_00]: valium at the end of the day, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would put people to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are things that you think about
as possibilities, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be, the next couple questions
are just gonna sort of serve as the
[SPEAKER_00]: lightning round here before we wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of opportunities, are there
opportunities that you would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: explore and what might they be going
forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sumo wrestling at the state capital for
stakeholders on issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can fundraise off of it and donate to
charities.
[SPEAKER_01]: This industry is extremely emotional,
reactive and hyper engaged, which is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as state regulators,
yeah, I think you should host those sumo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrestling matches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's tough to have everyone's
voice be heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be really nice if we could kind of do
some more like video conference calls so
[SPEAKER_04]: that the BCC and people can ask questions
directly of regulators in kind of a
[SPEAKER_04]: digital format so that we don't have to
come to, you know, drive, find parking,
[SPEAKER_04]: get a hotel room to ask a regulator
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think sometimes in the group
setting, it is nice to hear other people
[SPEAKER_04]: ask questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably were fearful of asking
because you think it's stupid,
[SPEAKER_04]: but then all of a sudden that question
gets asked.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that kind of larger group video
conference would be really nice for people
[SPEAKER_04]: to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just calling someone on a phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get to see facial expressions or
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't know how to judge if your
question is well received or heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think some video stuff would be
really nice for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're actually going to be doing more
videos, short videos on social media
[SPEAKER_02]: because we found that they're very
effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are really busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really analyze what are the
questions that are most often asked?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can get those out there like the
top three and the answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you need more information,
where to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to make, we just redesigned our
website recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to make it easier to navigate where
to find what you need absent making a call
[SPEAKER_02]: or sending an email, which of course you
can also do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's something that we work on very
hard at the Food and Ag.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to vote for sumo wrestling first
though, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just throw down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard the question, then Tara said sumo
wrestling, and then I lost the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alex, where were the speed rounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it matters anymore really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it not matter?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see more collaboration.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that between trade associations,
between stakeholders and the state,
[SPEAKER_03]: BCC, CDFA, CDPH, the consolidated version
of whatever we're going to see next year
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of compliance issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a big drop off right now with
metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state is politely being a little bit
lenient with it, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's fair to say that there is all these
different things that are just making it
[SPEAKER_03]: more difficult to just run a business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that more collaboration between
the state and stakeholders to put more
[SPEAKER_03]: information out so people can have a
baseline understanding of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't have to necessarily hire a
high priced or mid priced or low priced
[SPEAKER_03]: consultant, or they don't have to deal
with their lawyers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand people have to run their
businesses too with ancillary businesses
[SPEAKER_03]: or people that are not licensees.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there should be a level of just a
baseline of this information that people
[SPEAKER_03]: can get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't have to hire multiple
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all good feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the critiques coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep them coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously with this particular panel,
I'm fans of all the work of these folks on
[SPEAKER_00]: the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to also give everyone the
opportunity to talk a little bit about who
[SPEAKER_00]: is doing a communications program that you
actually pay attention to and think is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not everyone needs to say the Bureau
of Cannabis Control at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who's communications do you follow and
say these people are actually doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: great job?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I was telling someone or if I was
advising someone on how to run an
[SPEAKER_00]: effective communications program,
who would I point them to?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: You start this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have actually no one to give you that's
doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not in a bad way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that what we're seeing now is
with businesses that are not doing well,
[SPEAKER_03]: laying off employees, signaling to their
investors, signaling to the Canadian stock
[SPEAKER_03]: market, signaling to whoever, their
businesses, their employees.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nuanced.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that crisis communities and
communications actually is a, and I use
[SPEAKER_03]: that term loosely, but the way that you
message, be it Ease or be it Weedmaps or
[SPEAKER_03]: whoever it is or whatever company,
there's a nuanced way to communicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are ways to put the truth out
there and not kind of skirt around it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but at the same time be savvy about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that that is, I'm not to judge
anything that's out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's just an important part,
I think, of businesses right now in this
[SPEAKER_03]: downturn to be able to communicate with
the public effectively and not necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: say, oh, we're in the gutter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rebecca, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say for the Food and Ags Cal
Cannabis Division, I look a lot at the New
[SPEAKER_02]: York Times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the New York Times briefings.
[SPEAKER_02]: One paragraph summary.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you need to know right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want a really deep dive,
click here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing more of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're giving you that bite-sized bit of
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you want to know all the nuts
and bolts, we'll have a link that takes
[SPEAKER_02]: you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're doing that on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing that on our website.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing that with email alerts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with the Bureau and the Department
of Public Health and doing that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they just do such a great job of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's something that I look at
constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have their budget, but we still
aim high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I think David Downs and Leafley
are killing it right now for all the
[SPEAKER_04]: investigative reporting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So honestly, I mean, I can't even tell you
how many times I quote Leafley and David
[SPEAKER_04]: Downs' articles.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very helpful when I go into
regulators.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have some of the same information.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a trusted source.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have taken all the illegals off their
site, March in 2018, really leading the
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of advertisers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my hat's off to Leafley.
[SPEAKER_04]: And David Downs, I really appreciate your
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would second that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just even outside of cannabis,
there's so much information being thrown
[SPEAKER_01]: at all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking out here right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each and every one of you who's got a
cell phone, you're downloading
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the platforms are so vast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so credible journalism is what I have
found to be the savior so far of keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: our mental health okay in this space,
because there's so much misinformation,
[SPEAKER_01]: so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so much opportunity to have
misinformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can make or break a business,
a trade association, or the reputation of
[SPEAKER_01]: a government agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so credible journalism all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that point, and I want to sort of
maybe we conclude with this, but in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the whole point of this panel and
discussing the fact that words do matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the level of information that's coming
out and things are changing, and happening
[SPEAKER_00]: so quickly that you have to be
hyper-focused on what you're putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, because things can mean different
things to different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there anything that any of us right
now would like to, is there a
[SPEAKER_00]: misconception that we would like to clear
up in front of this fine cast of
[SPEAKER_00]: characters in the crowd, starting with
Miss Carver?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't hate hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a misconception that I hate hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't raise your taxes either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been trying to tell people that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still believe that you did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come from Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_01]: We strongly believe in hemp production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We truly believe it can solve a lot of the
world's climate crisis issues right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just absolutely do not want it grown in
Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will not cross-pollinate our genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a misconception that we hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate hemp, specifically me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hearing it out in the ethos.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I love hemp, just not in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to build on the hemp
conversation, because AB228 was something
[SPEAKER_04]: that we stopped last year, because they
would not give testing parity to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was not going to allow a product to sit
on my shelf that was untested,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the product right next to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to build for my consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Health and safety was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I hope this year, Aguilar Curry
takes AB228 and looks at it and gets
[SPEAKER_04]: parity for testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I would love low-cost CBDs to be
available to every single patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: That wants them and needs them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need higher production of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can't let it slip into the state of
California under the ruse that it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be safe for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs to be tested the same as
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we need it here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's a misconception too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I'm trying to keep hemp and
CBDs out of the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just trying to provide for my
consumers in a safe and effective way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since I've been doing that for 18
years for cannabis, I would hate for
[SPEAKER_04]: someone to just slip in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a couple of months, be able to get
underneath all the testing regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's another misconception I think
that I'd like to kind of get out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the questions we get asked the most
often is, for those who have a provisional
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cultivation license, do they need
to get credentialed into and learn how to
[SPEAKER_02]: use the California Cannabis Track and
Trace metric system?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there was some confusion early
on because with temporary licenses,
[SPEAKER_02]: that wasn't the requirement.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now with all provisional and annual
licenses, you do need to get credentialed
[SPEAKER_02]: into the metric system.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a program that is managed by the
Department of Food and Ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do have step-by-step guides,
videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about to publish a webinar and fact
sheets to help people go through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just want to make that clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sometimes some of the errors that
get published get repeated in future
[SPEAKER_02]: articles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them is that the metric system
went live as scheduled on January 2,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I keep seeing 2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep seeing January 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just went live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was January 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the team that killed themselves to get
it live is very, very proud of that fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is an area where we have a lot of
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're focusing on that quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that a misconception is that
medical cannabis is dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some amazing, and I'm not
biased, but my sample is Los Angeles more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the Los Angeles market more than I
know the Northern California market.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are some amazing dispensaries
there that are actually aggregating data,
[SPEAKER_03]: studying, talking to people, doing
intakes, and actually putting their hearts
[SPEAKER_03]: and their souls into helping people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that it has been tough for this
small operator and the medicine maker to
[SPEAKER_03]: get those products into stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I urge us to figure out a way to
strengthen the medical market and bring it
[SPEAKER_03]: back to true medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to have a safe place where
somebody can come to California and they
[SPEAKER_03]: can make informed decisions about the best
they can do for their medical condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: How would I know that Care By Design would
put my Crohn's disease into remission?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was living in Florida and I just heard
CBD in the wind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And suddenly Los Angeles, this is where it
was happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: A company like Cannacraft was making this
medicine for such a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I urge us not to go down that pipeline
of, oh, it's all recreation, it's all
[SPEAKER_03]: adult use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start being more conscious of the
medical market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we should praise and honor the
true medicine makers, not these
[SPEAKER_03]: monopolistic, crazy people in Los Angeles,
but the people that were actually
[SPEAKER_03]: providing medicine to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, well, I think I'm sure I forgot
to ask something awesome, but we've long
[SPEAKER_00]: outstripped the cold medicine at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what I would like to say is I
would like to thank everybody for
[SPEAKER_00]: listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if anything was to be learned
here, but I just wanted to have sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: fun discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thank you all for sticking around
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank our esteemed panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
