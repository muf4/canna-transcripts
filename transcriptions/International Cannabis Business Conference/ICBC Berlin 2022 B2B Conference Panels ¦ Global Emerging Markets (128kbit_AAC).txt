[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to give a big round of
applause to ICBC.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it blows my mind that we can all
sit in this room and talk about weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I come from a developing market from South
Africa and it's still fairly new to us in
[SPEAKER_08]: terms of the commercial space.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just fantastic to be able to be with
like-minded people who are really trying
[SPEAKER_08]: to change the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's not forget that cannabis has the
potential to have a seismic impact on the
[SPEAKER_08]: world we live in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is not in a good space right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we all carry a great responsibility to
try and make sure it's as clean,
[SPEAKER_08]: effective as possible and can help move
our planet forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just very briefly introduce myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I head up Chiba Africa.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are Africa's first cannabis education
and training company.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also run a consultancy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very involved in trying to push the whole
market forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've run sort of 45, 50 webinars in two
years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're quite at the front of the media.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I represent obviously South Africa and
from that perspective we'll be sharing
[SPEAKER_08]: some of the insights into what's happening
in our territory.
[SPEAKER_08]: But before we start, I just want everyone
to introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can introduce yourself and give us
a quick, quick snippet of what's happening
[SPEAKER_08]: in your land right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hello to everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am Darin Bostav.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am a lawyer from Uruguay, South America.
[SPEAKER_06]: My expertise is in licensing,
authorization and corporate matters for a
[SPEAKER_06]: company and also IPOs, contracts and all
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have also collaborated with the
government, my government, in drafting
[SPEAKER_06]: some regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm here to speak about Uruguay and the
South American market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Elizabeth, over to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Elizabeth Faenzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: CEO and founder of Lean Can Group and I'm
here representing Australia, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: this cannabis industry Australia and
Australia and Big Gulp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lovely to talk to you and have the
opportunity to talk about the amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities we have in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Carmen Durham.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the CEO of Helios Therapeutics,
New Zealand's largest vertically
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated licensed cannabis producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to share our stories from New
Zealand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helios is a medicines company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We achieved our EUGMP certificate in 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: It invented the market a few months later
and we're here as well to bring New
[SPEAKER_01]: Zealand cannabis to the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before our next guest speaks, I would just
like to give Thailand a round of applause
[SPEAKER_08]: for everything they're doing at the moment
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly the story that is on everyone's
lips at the moment is how you guys have
[SPEAKER_08]: just completely embraced cannabis and just
taken the world by storm.
[SPEAKER_08]: So well done.
[SPEAKER_08]: I look forward to hearing more about the
market, but please introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, my name is Lisa Moza.
[SPEAKER_04]: I come from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am CEO in the Ahech GCU.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are affiliated and you probably learned
that beginning of last month we kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: released cannabis from the Narcotic Pact.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's created a loophole right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's become a laugh spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now people can do whatever they want
about cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are working on a new act.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's under draft period.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is one of the members of the committee.
[SPEAKER_05]: So within 30 days from now I think there
will be a new act to control the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to just get a quick snapshot of how
everybody's territory works.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things I, when I first got
asked to facilitate this panel on
[SPEAKER_08]: developing cannabis industries,
I was expecting it to be the Uruguay's and
[SPEAKER_08]: Thailand and Mexico's.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, Ralph could not make the
session from Mexico, which is unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I kind of perceived it to be all the
developing economies.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just quickly from a South African
perspective, at the moment you can grow
[SPEAKER_08]: medical cannabis for export.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a very, very small local patient
market that's developing through what's
[SPEAKER_08]: called a Section 21.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then from 2018 you are allowed to grow
and cultivate cannabis for personal
[SPEAKER_08]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have a cannabis club model.
[SPEAKER_08]: But our legislation is a bit all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're kind of trying to figure it out
as we go along.
[SPEAKER_08]: But from a commercial perspective,
you know, for those of you who don't know,
[SPEAKER_08]: South Africa has a very deep pedigree with
growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been growing it for hundreds of
years.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're one of the biggest exporters already
of cannabis, very similar to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been exporting it evenly into
Europe, just the same as South America has
[SPEAKER_08]: been exporting into North America.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a lot of conversations around
South America becoming the sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: official breadbasket of cannabis into
North America and likewise Africa into
[SPEAKER_08]: Europe, you know, just because of our
growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a whole number of other things were
unpacked.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of the status in our
country at the moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we are here for business.
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone wants to buy any weed,
come and speak to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to just get a bit of
understanding of where the legal framework
[SPEAKER_08]: is in Uruguay at the moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you guys obviously were right at
the front of opening legislation up.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the current status?
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Trenton.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uruguay was the first country,
one word, to legalize the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: For all areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I say all areas, it's recreational,
medicinal, and hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Legalizing the cannabis for recreational
purposes for Uruguay, for being a small
[SPEAKER_06]: country between Argentina and Brazil with
just 3.5 million population, it was very
[SPEAKER_06]: difficult, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was very courage in that moment
from the government.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were called pirates from the
international control board.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was an interesting story.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Uruguay moved forward and has
developed three ways of access to
[SPEAKER_06]: recreational cannabis that are very
democratic because you have the
[SPEAKER_06]: self-motivators, you have the clubs,
and you also can purchase in the
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have the whole spectrum of
possibilities for you to access to
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, you can grow cannabis for medicinal
purposes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where you can make a THC with high-level
flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, if you want to export,
you have to be certified.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can make extracts, pharmaceutical
products.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is also a hemp market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and production.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, as a little country,
all the companies have the aim to export.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all the companies are focused in
export.
[SPEAKER_06]: So exporting to Europe, US, but also South
America because South America,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's 440 million people in South America.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Uruguay is a hub, yes, it's between
Argentina and Brazil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And gives companies a lot of possibilities
for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very progressive that you've managed
to cover all the models so that you've got
[SPEAKER_08]: this adult use market as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk about Australia.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're hearing lots of good things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I heard there were 200,000
patients a few weeks ago, and now you said
[SPEAKER_08]: there's almost 300,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are moving very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Trenton.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a number of scripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the statistics that we're getting from
the therapeutic goods administration and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Office of Drug Control around the
number of scripts that are being written
[SPEAKER_00]: to date are authorisations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we've had a bit of a movement
from people on special access moving
[SPEAKER_00]: across to authorised prescriber in recent
months, as that became easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more GPs under authorised prescriber
prescribing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The total number of scripts is heading
towards 300,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Australia had a very slow start from
2016 when medicinal was legalised.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really was only towards the end of 2019
that we started to see a little change in
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription patterns and authorisations
being approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a huge amount of that work comes down
to organisations, especially like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicinal Cannabis Industry Australia,
which is the representative body for the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, that just worked so hard to
develop a relationship with the Office of
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug Control and the TGA to ensure that
really sensible legislation got through
[SPEAKER_00]: and that we really would discuss with the
Office of Drug Control the impact of that
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation, unintended consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our industry had more knowledge about
cannabis than the Office of Drug Control
[SPEAKER_00]: did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all out there working with the
plants and working with design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really helped us to then see a
shift in legislation and a reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: red tape for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from really late 2019, we've seen a
continual acceleration of prescription,
[SPEAKER_00]: much more ease of getting products for
patients, much greater volumes of product,
[SPEAKER_00]: and therefore the price has come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the thing that I think many
other jurisdictions can learn from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia's 25 million people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not a massive population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a really big country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we've been able to do by having a
steady, consistent and evolving
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence-based regime, we've enabled the
price to come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people to get access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I spend a lot of time in Europe now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I see the struggles that are
happening in the UK, where there's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: nonsensical application of legislation
compared to what we've been doing in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia, I'm actually super proud of our
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the other thing that's been
useful is that we've aimed to establish a
[SPEAKER_00]: strong industry that could produce
high-quality GMP product, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the standard required.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, we can export that
high-quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now getting the volumes and the
scale to make the product cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also then investing in research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Australia has a very good research
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have fantastic opportunities through R
&D credits and refunds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually cash in the hand as a
company that money you put into research,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a large chunk of that back,
which you can then reinvest into research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what doctors are requiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the strength of our
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's industrial hemp,
which doesn't have any access to licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is strictly medicinal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like you've advanced really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm interested to know more about the
local market versus export.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get to that in a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about your land.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's happening that side?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so in New Zealand, the medicinal
cannabis scheme came in April of 2020 with
[SPEAKER_01]: a 18-month transition period for importers
and local producers to be able to meet the
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for producers in New Zealand,
you need to meet the GMP requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our GMP certificates are mutually
recognized as EU GMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also need to hold a medicinal cannabis
license as well for the steps in the
[SPEAKER_01]: process where you're producing or doing
that research.
[SPEAKER_01]: New Zealand is a small country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 5 million people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our patient population is growing quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've seen a patient population of
30,000 and growing to 50,000 in the coming
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're seeing month on month,
6% growth in patient numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's small.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we compare that patient growth
trajectory to Australia, which is a few
[SPEAKER_01]: years ahead of us, the trajectory is
really similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look from New Zealand to Australia
to see how the market is developing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also look at what is happening around
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that while we are one of the
newest countries to enter into the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal cannabis scheme, there's a lot
of learnings we've been able to take from
[SPEAKER_01]: other markets around the world,
bringing some of that talent into New
[SPEAKER_01]: Zealand to support our New Zealand market
and our ramp up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been a really great way to
accelerate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Sherry.
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of your plans in Thailand,
is there a real focus on export or are you
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to stimulate the local market
first?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your strategy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously you've flooded the market with
plants, really kind of opened things up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a long-term strategy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is export a big, big thing for Thailand?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically we outgrow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we grow a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Thailand, we have been doing that for a
year right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now the primary market is local.
[SPEAKER_05]: The buyer is the public hospitals.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't done anything in recreation
yet, and we don't plan to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, our company, so we're strictly
moving into medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, export is now our next target,
but we are looking, so we need GACP,
[SPEAKER_05]: we need GMP, so on and so forth in order
to do export.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on that right now,
so GACP should be around the corner.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done SOP already, so I would say
probably the latest would be MTC,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the next step would be EUGMP.
[SPEAKER_05]: Add a little bit, because you talked about
medical cannabis, in Thailand we have one
[SPEAKER_05]: department that Goldman has for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: They use herbs as medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now cannabis is one of the members of
the kind of herbs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a significant amount of doctors
who utilize those medicines.
[SPEAKER_05]: The number of cannabis patients is still
very low, I think a few thousand already.
[SPEAKER_05]: But hopefully that will grow up.
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of your export model,
so from an African perspective,
[SPEAKER_08]: we're focused on Europe, and South America
is very much in the northern part of the
[SPEAKER_08]: hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you guys have a specific region that
you're focused on trying to export your
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis into, or a particular place that
you've got in mind?
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously Europe, yes, because it's a
growing market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our advantage will be our cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: We presented yesterday in the investor
group.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think our operation cost is about five
US cents per gram of dried flowers,
[SPEAKER_05]: so that's very low.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is indoor, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: The main reason, because of the new lines
on the equator, so a lot of advantages,
[SPEAKER_05]: just like temperature, like sunlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our daily sunlight is about nine hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're talking about 12, 12 is just
three hours different, something like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we move into target of Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we can export to the US
right now, so the European market will be
[SPEAKER_05]: our first goal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I heard yesterday you said that one
of your USPs, since you have lots of
[SPEAKER_08]: sunshine and cheap labor, and I was like,
that's the same thing we say.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's obviously a competitive space
that we need to, and I want to talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: USPs across each territory in a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just give me some insight into,
is Australia open for, I know we are,
[SPEAKER_08]: from a South African perspective,
already exporting into Australia,
[SPEAKER_08]: but you mentioned before we came on stage
that there's been a big import market,
[SPEAKER_08]: but now as the local market is coming in
line, there seems to be a balance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think that eventually Australia
will have the capacity to create all their
[SPEAKER_08]: own medicinal cannabis, or is there still
a market for developing countries?
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at the licenses and the
production capacity, then yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: over time, if all of the licensed square
meterage gets built out, then Australia
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely would have the ability to
produce all of its own domestic cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and also export.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to note, a lot of people don't
realize that Australia is the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: exporter into the UK and into Germany,
so large amounts of medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: come from Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because it's GMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The certification process is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The standards are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to have German inspectors
come out to Australia because they trust
[SPEAKER_00]: the inspectors that we have in Australia
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a real advantage, and we're
seeing a lot of diversification into dose
[SPEAKER_00]: forms because there's so much research.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways that companies,
because in Australia you can't advertise
[SPEAKER_00]: your medicinal cannabis to patients,
the differentiation is coming through
[SPEAKER_00]: unique dose forms rather than kind of
branding and feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're getting a lot of innovation,
and because of our really good R&D tax
[SPEAKER_00]: system, that means that you get a much
better return for your investment dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: in Australia than in many other places in
the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys are importing a lot of GACP
cannabis and flipping it into GMP.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because for developing economies,
if you look at EUGMP, it's completely out
[SPEAKER_08]: of our spectrum.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't make any financial sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has been to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can imagine when Australia first
opened up medicinal cannabis, it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take two, three years before anyone
would have a license and be producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the government allowed imported
products to not have to meet all the arms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the therapeutic goods order 93 and 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have products that are being
made under GPP or GACP and other parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world coming in to meet that unmet
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're getting close to a position now
where that's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the federal government announced a
couple of months ago that from July 2023,
[SPEAKER_00]: all products entering Australia must meet
the same standards as products made in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be no more of this flipping
product in that is made at a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then upgrading it in Australia or
packaging it or whatever to make it GMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important because one of
the things that Australia sets itself
[SPEAKER_00]: apart, not just in cannabis, but if we
talk about food or we talk about other
[SPEAKER_00]: medications, it's that ability to have
very high quality trusted products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when other food products and medicines
go into Asia or Europe coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia, they're well regarded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we don't want to be seen as a
place where you could repackage things to
[SPEAKER_00]: make them look GMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get them out into another market.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a shame.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're quite enjoying our relationship with
you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: But fair enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, what it means is developing
economies that are trying to get flour out
[SPEAKER_08]: whenever it is hard need to just up our
game.
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of your specific target region
that you're trying to push your canvas
[SPEAKER_08]: into and how is that going?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Uruguay actually is exporting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's exporting to Germany, Portugal,
Israel, and also it's exporting to
[SPEAKER_06]: Switzerland and started this year
exporting to Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_06]: So mainly Uruguay is focused as a country
with just 3.5 million is focused in
[SPEAKER_06]: export.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has a very qualified workforce.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has companies with certification
and it has done all the homework.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, to have a good product.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the aim of all companies is export.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think there have been talks in
certain regions of quarters being said
[SPEAKER_08]: because obviously to some degree as
countries we protect ourselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's no way you're ever going
to export into Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got tons of stuff sitting around.
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you think that we're going to have
to, as developing countries, we're going
[SPEAKER_08]: to have to really fight for our place in
these developed markets which obviously
[SPEAKER_08]: are a lot more lucrative than ours?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uruguay historically has been an exporter
of commodities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're seeing that in this case it's
happening more or less the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's exporting raw material and will be
importing finest product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also has developed pharmaceutical
products.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in that way we see that Uruguay will
be more for that for exporting raw
[SPEAKER_06]: material, flowers, and all of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have potential to fight with the big
ones.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was saying that we were the
first one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have learned a lot in the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we see some countries that are going
back and forward with its regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Uruguay has really made the homework
very well in that regard.
[SPEAKER_06]: In my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have all the ways to compete with
the big ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've really capitalized on your first
move of advantage.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's very important.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I was in Lesotho two weeks ago,
which or Lesotho as our American friends
[SPEAKER_08]: call it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was with government and they were
just saying that they were first to market
[SPEAKER_08]: in Africa.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a huge buzz about Lesotho.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an amazing growing conditions,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then they didn't capitalize on it at
all.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they completely fall at the back of the
queue.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're trying to figure out how to go
back there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is, it does take sort of a certain
amount of aggressive business to get out
[SPEAKER_08]: there and build those channels.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys obviously had a great runway
to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Carmen, is there a market for other
countries to be shipping product into New
[SPEAKER_08]: Zealand or are you going to get it off of
Australia?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in New Zealand we do have some imported
products at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those imported products actually are much
more expensive than the locally produced
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that by the sign?
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't possibly comment.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take it as a yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the earliest goals when we
entered market was to improve access and
[SPEAKER_01]: affordability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been able to do that compared to
the imported products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which we're really proud of for our
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there is an opportunity to
import into New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our standards are relatively high from
those that have been trying to import
[SPEAKER_01]: products already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Products that are being accepted in
Australia or in Germany haven't been
[SPEAKER_01]: accepted yet in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is something to look into and really
understand those regulations if you did
[SPEAKER_01]: want to import.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of the Thai markets, I mean,
you guys talk about medicinal and that's
[SPEAKER_08]: obviously a focus.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all know that it's been completely
violent.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at Mary Jane a few days ago and how
this CBD flower market has just completely
[SPEAKER_08]: exploded with very well crafted flower,
hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also gathering that it's an entry
point and that most people do want to go
[SPEAKER_08]: THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: The reality is that we all talk about
medical cannabis but we know the
[SPEAKER_08]: recreational market is huge and is going
to be massive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you guys considered that there will
be a recreational market in Thailand?
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you got models?
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you looked at the club model?
[SPEAKER_08]: So the responsible adult use, is there any
narrative around that at the moment or are
[SPEAKER_08]: you just focusing on medical?
[SPEAKER_05]: For a company, we're just focusing on the
medical.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the country, I cannot really give
you the perfect answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: But from my opinion right now,
this route is cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the government will allow
recreation from this cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they will probably only approve for the
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, so that's what I'm explaining to
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: On top of that, what interval market,
I think we expect a lot of countries in
[SPEAKER_05]: Asia that will open for medical cannabis
but not open for growing in the near
[SPEAKER_05]: future.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a big market.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, Japan, China, they have a
movement to allow patients to use cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: but not growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a big opportunity for us to move
into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think your unique selling
point?
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the advantages?
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to stand there with a whole lot
of other countries.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why should the cannabis industry be
interested in cannabis from Thailand?
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the reasons?
[SPEAKER_08]: How would you sell cannabis to the general
world?
[SPEAKER_05]: I still look at cannabis as a normal
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not totally different from other
businesses, according to my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first of all, the quality of the
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to grow international
strength.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have our own strength.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's very high THP also.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're talking about 20-25% if we do it
properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's our advantage.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second one is cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have good product with a lower
cost, you can sell anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: For medicinal purposes, it's a greenhouse
or indoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two possibilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can grow also outdoors, but the
companies have decided to use that two
[SPEAKER_06]: months.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are some of your US pieces of
territory?
[SPEAKER_06]: Why should you care about cannabis from
Uruguay?
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, Uruguay is between Argentina
and Brazil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to enter South America,
as I said, a continent of 440 million
[SPEAKER_06]: people, Uruguay is a very good option,
first of all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, it's a country that in South
America has a stability institution,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the country with less corruption
levels, and it has investing rate,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's also very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also gives tax exemptions for the
companies, and has qualified workforce.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the second country worldwide in
renewable energies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also have the government supporting
our sector.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, they would stand here,
the Uruguayan government, they stand in
[SPEAKER_06]: this expo to invite investors to come to
Uruguay and produce in Europe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me, when we talk about developing
economies, we often talk about the
[SPEAKER_08]: financial benefit of cannabis to people on
the ground.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a big challenge in South Africa at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have farmers that have been growing
cannabis for hundreds of years who are
[SPEAKER_08]: still criminals.
[SPEAKER_08]: There have been growing cannabis to feed
their kids and to send their kids to
[SPEAKER_08]: school who are to serve our technically
criminals.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have big farms that have a lot
of capital invested into them who can grow
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis legally who are not criminals.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have this complete juxtaposition
between the people who have actually put
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis on the map and are still unable
to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So our licensing situation is very,
very complex.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the Uruguayan government recognize
that cannabis needs to be able to filter
[SPEAKER_08]: down to build the economy?
[SPEAKER_08]: And to also filter down to the lower
levels of the economic spectrum?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it just really focused on bringing
as much cash in as possible?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: The government from 2013, 14, and 15 over,
I would say, has seen the cannabis sector
[SPEAKER_06]: as an industry that brings possibilities
for all the spectrums of the society.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only for the big companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have also two or three acres,
for example, family owned.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that invested 20, 30 thousand dollars
for hemp CBD flowers, for example,
[SPEAKER_06]: for exporting.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's accessible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about in Thailand?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, do you have a strong mandate from
government to make sure that people on the
[SPEAKER_08]: ground will benefit from cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to classify it to three
categories right now in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one is the major player, big player
like what we are doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the second one is they allow any
household to grow up to 10 plants per
[SPEAKER_05]: household.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, you guys know better than me,
growing cannabis to have flowers is not
[SPEAKER_05]: easy at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in real life, I don't know that they
can do commercially.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what can they do with those 10 plants?
[SPEAKER_05]: They can do whatever they want to sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They cannot sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can consume it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a gap in between,
which is the underground who used to have
[SPEAKER_05]: experiences to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they are legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that can be like SME for me,
who grow cannabis a small amount,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they know exactly how to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have three categories right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is filtering down and trickling down
as opportunities are available.
[SPEAKER_05]: The government even announced to give away
a million plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did you get a million plants?
[SPEAKER_05]: The government grown them.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they have seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you guys know, growing cannabis is not
easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it depends on... Be interested to see
how many of those million plants actually
[SPEAKER_05]: survive and go to flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Half of them are female and male.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, you need to tear this up
very easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: That does it by five.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just get in there and just learn the hard
way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exciting.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are in completely different
economies.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess the narrative around the bottom
layers of people is not so prevalent.
[SPEAKER_08]: But is there access?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it an exclusive kind of industry where
you need lots of dollar to get in?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or can you find that people have access
generally?
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the industry commercial
perspective, yes, this is an industry that
[SPEAKER_00]: requires expertise, understanding of both
agriculture and GMK.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of facilities are very pricey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're long term investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I will say from Australia is
that under our constitution, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: personal use of something like cannabis
actually falls under state legislation and
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't in the remit of the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anytime that representatives of the
federal government are asked about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say it's a matter for the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've seen the ACT has legalized
personal use, personal wronging of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for personal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've legalized that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A number of states have decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think last week or might be this
week in Western Australia, they're having
[SPEAKER_00]: a debate about it in parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is that kind of harm
minimization and kind of recognition of
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of ubiquity of cannabis within
Australian society.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we actually have almost the
highest personal usage of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have a bunch of stones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can't comment, but maybe that's
why we're so easy going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the medicinal perspective,
even our supplement industry has very high
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our nutraceuticals and our food
supplements, vitamins and minerals are
[SPEAKER_00]: always produced to a really high standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're recognized around the world as
being really high quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from when the law was changed,
the law was changed because there were
[SPEAKER_00]: patients in need who were dying or in
severe pain, really suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their families got together to really
lobby the government and got into the
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we always remember in Australia
that we were begun by patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole idea of strengthening the
Australian industry is to get that price
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly why I started my company was
to do whatever I could to help the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry to get to a place where it could
compete with the non-regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the floor price for licensed medicinal
cannabis industry in Australia is now the
[SPEAKER_00]: same as the floor price of the black
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we've done extremely well
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are more expensive products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we have almost the widest
choice of products in medicinal varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: when we don't have a commercial
recreational market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of choice for patients,
lots of different ways they can take the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's becoming much more personalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to see interest now in
some of the work that the medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry in Australia's been
doing has been to reach out through our
[SPEAKER_00]: healthcare practitioner and patient groups
to talk to the colleges of general
[SPEAKER_00]: practice and specialist colleges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to now see movements
towards education being developed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: colleges specific to medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really where we're going to see
a lot more doctors feeling comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously you've always got the bleeding
edge doctors and the leading edge doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more mainstream doctors will
require that education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a real focus of the industry and
the industry's organizations and the
[SPEAKER_00]: various patient groups in Australia to get
really well-educated doctors, get the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system recognized within
teaching schools and continuing education
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's essential everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's part of the evolution as the
market matures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first Australia was pretty much
just all oils and subliminal oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's, I think, 140 different
methods of taking the product in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also shifted from being
predominantly processed products now to
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality flour products, taking more
and more of the market share.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of New Zealand, there are,
in developing economies, you've got lots
[SPEAKER_08]: of parallel industries.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you've got a developed
pharmaceutical industry or an agricultural
[SPEAKER_08]: industry, it's a lot easier to pivot and
bring on these new sort of areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: How does that mean an advantage in New
Zealand?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do people capitalize on that as an
advantage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one thing that's great about New
Zealand is that we have a really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really strong horticulture and agriculture
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of innovation in this space
that is being able to come across from
[SPEAKER_01]: other crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from kiwifruit, from Pinus radiata,
around tissue culture, around light
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're able to use that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we're entering into the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that collaboration and that
opportunity is really exciting for what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're building in New Zealand and a key
way of us being able to accelerate our
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other things that you were
speaking out about before as well is just
[SPEAKER_01]: that licensing regime and how it filters
down through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some of the larger companies
like Helios, which are vertically
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is also over 40 cultivation
licenses in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can range from very large
cultivation spaces, like we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: strategic partnership with Puro,
who grow on the beautiful Kaikoura coast,
[SPEAKER_01]: to very small boutique cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we partner at Helios with some of
those small boutique cultivators for their
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass, which we then take through our
extraction process to get the unique
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene and full spectrum profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really like the fact that we're able
to work with small boutique cultivators,
[SPEAKER_01]: large cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have our indoor growing space at
the site that we can use for high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: dried flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a real range and a lot of that through
the collaboration and the focus on
[SPEAKER_01]: innovation in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Using existing infrastructures
essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Existing infrastructure, also existing
research at the universities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some strong agricultural
universities that are doing research in
[SPEAKER_01]: this space that can see the opportunity
for the industry for students who are
[SPEAKER_01]: graduating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those students are doing research
and then feeding not only our product
[SPEAKER_01]: pipeline, but also our talent pipeline as
the industry matures.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of the time market, you've
obviously got certain industries that are
[SPEAKER_08]: more developed than others.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you identified industries in Thailand
that you think will embrace and help the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis industry move forward,
whether that be pharmaceutical or
[SPEAKER_08]: agricultural or product development?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now there's a few big projects going
around, which I can give you information
[SPEAKER_05]: for some of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them will plan to use part of
cannabis plants to become chicken food.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have research in Thailand and they
found that chicken, after they have,
[SPEAKER_05]: that probably cannabis leaves,
the chicken becomes more calm and lays
[SPEAKER_05]: eggs more.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be... You lay eggs more.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one big project.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other one also comes from the huge
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: They plan to open satellite clinic using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one, I love it so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: They plan to become using like CSR for the
one who cannot afford for the price.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good project moving on also.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I agree with her that to educate
market is very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only in school, but country-wide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I almost believe that in every
country, when you announce legalized
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, there will be pro and con,
I mean, against.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people will say no.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you can educate market and let them
realize the benefit of legalized cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: so also educate market is very important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to quickly, I want to take
some questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're almost out of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to quickly go through the
panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is Industrial Hemp Act in your
territory?
[SPEAKER_06]: Industrial Hemp Act.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you growing Industrial Hemp?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Industrial hemp actually is grown for CBD
flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the market for the grain is under
development.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are two or three projects,
big projects, under development.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the industry of hemp has developed in
the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the CBD develops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Australia, any interest in hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have a strong Industrial Hemp
sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2018, Australia and New Zealand,
under the Food Standards of Australia and
[SPEAKER_00]: New Zealand Act, allowed hemp seeds to
become a food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that health food stores
have all sorts of hemp products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have hemp CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Market CBD is either a schedule three or
schedule four product in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the separations actually worked really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's been no confusion for hemp
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know they're building either for
industrial purposes, or for food,
[SPEAKER_00]: or for food for animals, or for human
consumption, fiber, fabric, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's been, the farmers haven't
kind of been lured by the promise of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, and then forgotten all the
fantastic environmental benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial Hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so in New Zealand, Industrial Hemp
is available for food and fiber.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do half hemp also.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the focus for hemp today?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it textile?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because obviously you've got a good
industry there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mainly textile right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We obviously all talk about THG cannabis,
which is more of the sexy side.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the end of the day, as I started to
learn more about hemp a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_08]: the capacity for hemp to have a positive
impact on our environment, it's completely
[SPEAKER_08]: mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we all often get stuck in the high THC
conversation, but I just wanted to touch
[SPEAKER_08]: and see where each territory is at.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really encouraging to hear that
there is hemp running in parallel to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys, we've got five minutes left.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if there are any questions,
if you could put your hands up and this
[SPEAKER_08]: gentleman here will bring you a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Going once.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a gentleman over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lady over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Dr. Shikshia Gallo, cannabis clinician
from South Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well done, friends and my brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my question is, as an emerging market,
guys, what are your views on regulating
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't regulate poppy and we make
morphine that can kill people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't regulate tobacco and we don't
tell the doctors, don't tell your patients
[SPEAKER_02]: how many cigarettes to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't regulate that either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to know, as coming into the
industry, what are your views on
[SPEAKER_02]: regulating the plant instead of the end
product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we looking at changing the narrative
and looking at things differently?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to understand what your views
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Australia, we do regulate the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do regulate poppy and we do regulate
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't just regulate the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Australia was a big producer of
opiates, at least the APIs that went on to
[SPEAKER_00]: become other things, and especially down
in places like Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is a control crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that there weren't any
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing, too, is that when you
look at a poppy, it's not so easy to take
[SPEAKER_00]: that poppy yourself in your kitchen and
turn it into a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people do die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's quite different to the
ubiquity of the uses of the plant growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the fields or growing in someone's
backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But taking off my Australian hat and
looking at, you know, from my
[SPEAKER_00]: international relations background,
harmonisation is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the use of regulation to impoverish
and imprison people is a global shame of
[SPEAKER_00]: this period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to do everything we can to
remediate that situation and also to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that we don't put people into
health poverty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born with a really rare disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents sold everything to keep me
alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm here in 57 years of age when my
parents were told at two that I was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to die and there was nothing that could be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they spent every cent they had,
every cent they saved, every cent they
[SPEAKER_00]: could borrow and took me to Italy to get
surgery that saved my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at 12, I had four strokes and
they were told again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, health poverty is an enormous
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not, you can't fix that by saying
grow your own plant because families with
[SPEAKER_00]: very ill children can't make the medicine
that their children need in most cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: not all cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to trust the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to have a high quality,
that is consistent, that they can trust
[SPEAKER_00]: and that isn't going to bankrupt them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I got into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know a lot of the other CEOs in
Australia and they all have similar
[SPEAKER_00]: stories of family members and really
compassionate reasons why they got
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for sharing that story.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very interesting how many people in
the cannabis industry have stories to
[SPEAKER_08]: tell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, what's incredibly important,
Prohibition Partners, the recent global
[SPEAKER_08]: report, they put out, and we were quite
disappointed because Africa got quite a
[SPEAKER_08]: small mention.
[SPEAKER_08]: But one of the things they talked about
was the fact that the African markets are
[SPEAKER_08]: purely focused on export and getting our
medicine to other people, but not looking
[SPEAKER_08]: after other people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're quite right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you look at the CBD market,
it's completely, for our populace,
[SPEAKER_08]: unaffordable.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a tiny, tiny segment of population.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that is a massive,
massive issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing is about regulating.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where do you regulate it in a developed
economy?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an argument to be said that you
don't regulate the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: You regulate the processing and
distribution.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been trying to stop people growing
in their backyards for decades and
[SPEAKER_08]: decades.
[SPEAKER_08]: It never worked.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's all these models that I think
are needed in different countries for
[SPEAKER_08]: different dynamics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we can probably take one more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for a great panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is actually for you,
Laura, my comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: You said something that caught my
attention in reference to EUGMP.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Greg, you said it was not a financial
problem for South African cultivators.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you unpack that a little bit more?
[SPEAKER_08]: So ultimately, one of the USPs of a
developing economy that has good sunshine
[SPEAKER_08]: is obviously our light.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we start to grow in bulk,
the cost of processing is similar to
[SPEAKER_08]: growing in Canada or Europe, because it's
in bulk.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we have lower costs in electricity
and lower labor costs.
[SPEAKER_08]: But as efficiency in the international
market increases and the cost per gram
[SPEAKER_08]: comes down because of economies of scale,
et cetera, the opportunity to compete
[SPEAKER_08]: price point-wise on an EUGMP level is,
I don't believe it's long-term
[SPEAKER_08]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to, I believe in our territory to
grow medical cannabis that grow in
[SPEAKER_08]: tunnels.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hypertunnels is the best way forward
because you get utilization of the sun,
[SPEAKER_08]: but you also will grow in a controlled
environment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's one of the biggest
challenges is we can't sell like for like.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to look at the strategic
advantages we have from our territory,
[SPEAKER_08]: from our sunlight, and all those other
elements.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to figure out what the best thing
is.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other problem at the moment,
from a South African perspective,
[SPEAKER_08]: is it's the tail wagging dog.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are being dictated, inverted commas,
by the international market who want a
[SPEAKER_08]: particular THC level, who want particular
strains growth.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would like to see developing markets
like yourself that has been able to come
[SPEAKER_08]: to events like this and go, this is what
we grow, this is how we grow, this is our
[SPEAKER_08]: cost per gram, and sell the cannabis based
on what we are developing as opposed to
[SPEAKER_08]: being told what to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other fear we have is exporting raw
product and then importing product back
[SPEAKER_08]: into our economies, which we've been doing
for decades, especially in Africa.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that just can't happen because that
makes no commercial sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope that answers your question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, I think we have time for one more
question or are we?
[SPEAKER_08]: One more question guys, one more question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone have any hands up?
[SPEAKER_08]: No?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for our entire panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
