[SPEAKER_00]: The next person I'm bringing up right now,
he's going to talk about all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: international things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the CEO or the managing director of
the multiverse and he's here for you right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for the one, the only,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick Eesley.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't give me a podium to stand
behind here and hide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hopefully a little different than
what you were used to there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the comments from that last one
will be indicative of some of the things I
[SPEAKER_01]: go over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick Eesley, really good to be here back
in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the third year helping with ICBC
and really starting to create a global
[SPEAKER_01]: industry of the largest consumer good in
the history of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really excited to share a little bit
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm CEO of 3C Consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started that almost 13 years ago in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also managing director of multiverse
capital, private equity and venture
[SPEAKER_01]: capital funds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said there's a little button here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a laser on it, which will
probably get me in trouble to see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a CPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a certified financial analyst.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run venture capital, private equity
funds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also seen this industry evolve for
over 13 years from Colorado 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: First kind of bona fide commercial medical
program starting 2008 to 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: First adult use recreational state,
even more legal than Amsterdam ever even
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started working in California,
multiple other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have operations in 24 states,
have done licenses in 13 countries,
[SPEAKER_01]: worked in over 20 countries now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really have gotten to see the US
market, the global market, and from the
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting with working with clients,
really have understood what works,
[SPEAKER_01]: what doesn't, where is capital powerful?
[SPEAKER_01]: And really positioning like the last panel
said, it's not about trying to be Philip
[SPEAKER_01]: Morris or Pfizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being bought by them and like how to
position things for M and A's versus
[SPEAKER_01]: private and public.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've seen all sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I look at markets based on the
market for cannabis itself, not so much as
[SPEAKER_01]: like your country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I offend your ideas or your country
or your policies, I apologize in advance,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm not guessing on what I'm going to
talk about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the truth from the trenches of
this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit of background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally I'm like from farm country in
Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a crypto linguist for the Air Force.
[SPEAKER_01]: I speak Spanish, a couple other languages,
unfortunately my Dutch, Danish,
[SPEAKER_01]: Greek, and German are not very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much for our translators
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from starting in Colorado,
like as that first state, only 6 million
[SPEAKER_01]: people, but we learned specifically what
not to do, which is more important as
[SPEAKER_01]: you're investing and navigating this
landscape than knowing what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not repeating the same mistakes that
others have done time and time again with
[SPEAKER_01]: product recalls or building a giant indoor
facility that costs let's say four,
[SPEAKER_01]: 450, $500 a square foot to build compared
to big greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see what works.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes indoor works depending on
the state or the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've done this long enough to really
see what's working, what's not working,
[SPEAKER_01]: what teams are really turning into good
investments and what to completely avoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some of these markets, it'd be
better to just put your money in a pile
[SPEAKER_01]: and burn it than invest into some of those
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to make sure you know how to not
lose your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to be investing in the
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just kind of like look like here
at the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we started in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this plant we inherited.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like hundreds of thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our species has been working with this
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't invent this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our great grandparents passed this down to
us and it's our job now to create a
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible industry to like pass on to
future generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a boom and bust thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a snuggie or some new little
fun toy that people are going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in and maybe not like in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already seen in the United States
over a hundred billion dollar illicit
[SPEAKER_01]: black market economy from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people have been willing to break the
law, go to jail here, there, everywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: for this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have this moment that this is
being legalized on a medical basis around
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have a certain amount of time to
establish this industry with some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: news I'm going to go over from this last
few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have decades to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've been doing this fast,
fast, fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This last three years, things have
exploded from the first tinders in Germany
[SPEAKER_01]: or licenses in Denmark or what's happening
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And compared to the United States,
we didn't have public markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we would have really scaled and
taken that enormous market share that the
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian public companies are now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at Canada, it's kind of
like up north there and really cold and
[SPEAKER_01]: gray and not the best place to do
agricultural production to supply the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had that first mover advantage and
have now been trying to do acquisitions
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I see from an investment
standpoint, I'm a big advocate of private
[SPEAKER_01]: investments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most things that I like for the public
markets are preparing to short them
[SPEAKER_01]: because I know that the bubble is bigger
than any bubble we've seen in the history
[SPEAKER_01]: of public markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 300 X over value like a company doing
a million in revenue that's got a market
[SPEAKER_01]: cap of like four billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean dot coms this we're going to get
into is like a hundred X.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like 300 X.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's huge opportunities for short
and if you know what and when to do this
[SPEAKER_01]: when we're thinking about the world where
this is going it's going to go very very
[SPEAKER_01]: fast based on a few laws that are going to
be written into law anywhere from
[SPEAKER_01]: September to March this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're thinking about these sorts
of companies if you're an investor in
[SPEAKER_01]: normal sectors you know market risk team
risk product risk like the normal things
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to think about for due diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in cannabis you have to remember this
is a start up industry full of startup
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most startups fail because they're not
bona fide businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raising capital is difficult especially if
you can't go to the bank and say hey I
[SPEAKER_01]: need a loan to start this cannabis
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's federally illegal where you're
trying to do this you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: institutional capital that's going to give
you your investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need private sources of capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we've seen over 200 million dollars
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: loaned out at 18.8 percent on real estate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I pay off buildings in two three four
five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's not like normally like a
mortgage is until death.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're thinking about making 18
percent on real estate it's because banks
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't doing loans institutions aren't
doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like there's a huge opportunity here
not just for investing into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: companies touching the plant cultivation
processing distribution dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction manufacturing but the ancillary
side of this industry as well like real
[SPEAKER_01]: estate is stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean other than 2008 2009 of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of kicked off some bad things there
from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm looking at these sorts of
markets and like what do I need to do for
[SPEAKER_01]: due diligence when I'm managing like my
personal capital my investors capital my
[SPEAKER_01]: number one rule is like don't lose my
investors money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my second rule is like see rule
number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't be risky and just throw it all
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of risk in this space
and there's always risk in startup
[SPEAKER_01]: industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the opportunity of getting large
private positions on the cap table like
[SPEAKER_01]: with board control and seeing these
companies scale that's where there's the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest impact for private capital now
where you can actually get in for like
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say half a million and get 10
percent of a company 20 percent of a
[SPEAKER_01]: company that starts to scale these things
like we literally grow money on trees like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what our business does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're making a cash flow business
and you're investing into that the
[SPEAKER_01]: proceeds the dividends the distributions
are enormous if you have the right tax
[SPEAKER_01]: structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of these companies I'll see a
New York entity or some crazy company
[SPEAKER_01]: that's doing the investment in some
international project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other risk you have to look at is
like where is your money coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is it going through like Holland BV
is going through Luxembourg like and then
[SPEAKER_01]: where is that capital coming back to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to think about the long term
exit strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our funds are like six eight 10
year exits where we just reinvest reinvest
[SPEAKER_01]: reinvest huge exits come.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not preparing for like
capital gains taxes or how you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get all of that capital back and not lose
40 50 60 percent of it even if the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity is a great investment you're
going to lose so much money in the future
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't plan for these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now those are the risks that as you're
looking at these opportunities it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: than just can they grow good wheat or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the easy part.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is agriculture but the normal risks
are much more difficult in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've got all this Canadian
public news and all this distraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard to see like what's
true what's not what's good source of
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we're being deep in the
industry being under the hood of hundreds
[SPEAKER_01]: of different companies and knowing what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see this is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not for investors to go into this
on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very very very challenging especially into
the public market because 90 percent of
[SPEAKER_01]: what you read is not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of in this slide thinking about
like that dot com bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of these startup companies are
going to fail and when you're looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: a unicorn like that magical investment
that's going to have hundreds of X or when
[SPEAKER_01]: you can buy Amazon shares for two dollars
a share.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you want to be getting in and
playing with these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like when they're trading at
fifteen hundred a share and that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what we try to position for and you that's
why you only have this moment once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so much risk in this industry
that if you can know where to put in early
[SPEAKER_01]: this is not going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only a matter of time until like
larger legalization happens medically is
[SPEAKER_01]: so important to focus on internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recreational is violating international
laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always know if you're investing into
recreational cannabis be it in Uruguay be
[SPEAKER_01]: it in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be it future Mexico recreational your
country and company is violating
[SPEAKER_01]: international law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll violate federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll follow state law but never violate
international law because you will lose
[SPEAKER_01]: your market share and ability to export
which we'll talk about shortly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that we notice
internationally the same problem here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany as we'll get into is that without
demand like and legal demand you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a market like we're creating patients
and this is a patient focused market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But patients come from doctors writing
prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patients are then your clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clients are your revenue and revenue is
your business and without patients you
[SPEAKER_01]: have nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this huge component now that we
need much more doctor education clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: research clinical trials because so many
doctors even here in Germany they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: stoked on writing a prescription for
someone to go home and smoke a plant like
[SPEAKER_01]: everything from their medical practices
said like smoking is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to try to get doctors to understand
what are the efficacies with cannabis how
[SPEAKER_01]: to use this properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a doctor like people think about
brands like brands are so important for
[SPEAKER_01]: normal industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in cannabis it's an API an active
pharmaceutical ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a doctor writes a prescription
they go into that database they look at
[SPEAKER_01]: that they put in cannabis if they didn't
write a specific brand like Viagra or some
[SPEAKER_01]: specific product they're going to get the
generic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in these countries like Germany where
they're actually paying for standardized
[SPEAKER_01]: health care the highest quality standard
at the lowest price is the generic for the
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learned that in the first round of the
German Tinder process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about brands it's about the
highest quality standards at the lowest
[SPEAKER_01]: price reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we don't create the demand which
there's demand from the consumers and the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients but legal access and the
gatekeepers are the doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in a country or if you're in
a program you have to work towards doctor
[SPEAKER_01]: education as part of your investment
thesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise you're not going to have clients
to actually fund that business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know I think about like planning
and like when to enter a market like
[SPEAKER_01]: what's important for a business like the
team the market the product what's unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it differentiated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do these people for me it's not important
for a project or for an investment if they
[SPEAKER_01]: even know anything about cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an agricultural commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is manufacturing pharmaceutical
processing and this is retail or
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think about that first it's not
that special it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicinal plant but it's still a plant and
agriculture has been around for 10,000
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any of these new big gimmicks you might
invest into from like cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: companies or fertilizer companies that are
going to quadruple your yields like you
[SPEAKER_01]: got to look into that because traditional
agriculture we weren't growing corn and
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouses like it just doesn't make
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to have like a six hectare
indoor facility that's GMP that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your cost of production is going to be
so high your competitive advantage is
[SPEAKER_01]: gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only time like planning or a big
indoor works is if it's part of a vertical
[SPEAKER_01]: market or for like research and
development but really four season hybrid
[SPEAKER_01]: GMP greenhouses are the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can like ride in and catch a big
wave a big investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's like people around you that
knock it off or if all of a sudden your
[SPEAKER_01]: program no longer can do what you think
you're going to do your business is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the planning is more important for
these teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking at an investment look
at the team do they know what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing from outside industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they come from finance.
[SPEAKER_01]: From manufacturing from processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything unique there at all or
are they just master growers because like
[SPEAKER_01]: master growers are not master business
people and like our joke in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is like their master fuck ups.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's more because like they're the
biggest problem with all of our industry
[SPEAKER_01]: because they started a cultivation knowing
what they did in their basement or their
[SPEAKER_01]: closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're trying to do that on a
commercial scale and they have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look for people with agricultural
experience or pharmaceutical experience
[SPEAKER_01]: not just people that know how to make good
hash like that's the easy part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of things that really from my
investment thesis internationally for our
[SPEAKER_01]: private equity and venture capital you got
to know the rules to play the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone's just looking at this
industry and it's so exciting but they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what rules govern them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you always have to know what you have
to serve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the WHO and the reclassification
this is enormous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these things that's happened the
last three to six months have changed the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire international landscape of what's
legal what's not where to produce and
[SPEAKER_01]: where to avoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though there's some countries like
we'll get into with like Cyprus and Malta
[SPEAKER_01]: and Greece and like countries in Central
and South America or your amazing tie in
[SPEAKER_01]: with like the Zimbabwe president or
something like just because it sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: unique if it's not following some of these
laws it's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to lose your money and you're
going to think of how great it would have
[SPEAKER_01]: been and then you're going to regret.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the one thing with this time
Delta.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only have so much time to get your
money into the markets and private
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because public everyone's going to trade
in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once this is institutionalized Amazon's
1500 bucks a share.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just trading like everyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're shorting the Hong Kong dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The companies that won't come in now
that's where there's the opportunity now
[SPEAKER_01]: to get your capital in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every day like I don't have investors
capital their money is less valuable to me
[SPEAKER_01]: because that time is so important
especially with some of these single
[SPEAKER_01]: conventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the single convention of 1961 is your
Bible currently if you're in global
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially with the CND coming out as
well of like pushing for like the
[SPEAKER_01]: rescheduling we were hoping they were
going to vote on this like we were with
[SPEAKER_01]: the U.N.
[SPEAKER_01]: and the end of the year in Vienna.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were hoping this was going to come
through like for the rescheduling and
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much requiring that countries of
the single convention would be providing
[SPEAKER_01]: these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one hundred and sixty eight
different countries that once this vote
[SPEAKER_01]: goes through and is enacted must provide
those products to patients in their
[SPEAKER_01]: countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't care if they want to legalize
cannabis or not or produce it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to provide insulin to people
with diabetic like with diabetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much like what some of this
would mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we have like three to twelve
months to really position companies to be
[SPEAKER_01]: global producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not Canada not just Israel not just
Holland not just Denmark but the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: quality lowest cost of production
countries that are legal currently or
[SPEAKER_01]: enacting laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that are going to wait two three
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: By that time it's too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: For what we're doing internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: The INCB like International Narcotics
Control Board like that's when we start
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about like Interpol and like
adult things like don't violate
[SPEAKER_01]: international law.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really really bad for business and
really bad for your freedom if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: stay a free person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their report about two three weeks ago the
2018 report was pretty much who's on the
[SPEAKER_01]: naughty list who's on the nice list like
kind of like a Santa Claus and which
[SPEAKER_01]: programs are bona fide and real and which
programs are illegal and viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Violating international law and just
because there's a country that makes a
[SPEAKER_01]: program if it's not compliant with the
international law they won't be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: export their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the problems that many Colombians
are going to face many Israelis are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to face.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of these countries are producing
under the local requirements of that
[SPEAKER_01]: program but not knowing how they have to
be compliant internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me for where I invest I always
think how do I produce at the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: standards of the country I have to produce
that but what's the hardest country in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world to import.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to produce at their standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Canada started with GPP.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like they didn't even know what
GMP was at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the European Union European GMP
is kind of important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just say you're certified and
processed when the INCB is coming out and
[SPEAKER_01]: sending warning letters to countries
saying you're breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's kind of a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a warning letter of like we're
going to raid you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to shut this down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you invest into one of those countries
and that happens your investments done
[SPEAKER_01]: market risk your market just went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were making tires and tires are now
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's the position you do not want
to be with one of your investments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's think about like hemp here
because there's cannabis you know there's
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's kind of confused what's the
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all dogs and like the joke is like
cannabis is like a poodle and hemp is like
[SPEAKER_01]: a Great Dane.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both from wolves and humans
through us breeding them like Gregor
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendel like with pea pods back here in
Germany a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we made different types of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis sativa it's the same species
and the biological definition of a species
[SPEAKER_01]: is the ability to make sexually viable
offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could take the biggest hemp plant
with the smallest highest THC cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and it's going to be somewhere in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like don't take a bulldog and mix it
with a Shih Tzu and get some bullshit is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like the example there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that point three percent point four
percent for THC is really what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between hemp and cannabis and
hemp and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge opportunities in it especially in
Europe but in the United States and many
[SPEAKER_01]: of these countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely illegal CBD in the United
States is the same scheduling as heroin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like people are like it's legal in 50
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like pretty much like heroin or
narcotics like the same schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get into that also know the
rules to play that game because if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not legal you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like with Austria with Switzerland
with some of these hemp programs coming
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing novel foods opportunities for CBD
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's just a CBD company and doesn't
have novel foods doesn't have some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those registrations it's not going to take
international money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to take international
market share and Rite Aid or Walgreens or
[SPEAKER_01]: big pharmaceutical companies are not going
to buy your products like you might think
[SPEAKER_01]: for your revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the United States we had the farm bill
in 2014 which started the legalization of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis like for hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 2018 farm bill started and really made
things legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the United States will not be global
hemp producers at least as of now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have the infrastructure research
and development the genetics like we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing so much breeding we're getting
better and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at Charlotte's Web like Stanley
Brothers 21 million last quarter like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was just from a small company in
Colorado where we were one of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: big hemp producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're thinking about the FDA
Epidex Sativex GW Pharmaceutical that that
[SPEAKER_01]: company was approved by the FDA as a
cannabinoid and really set a precedent for
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD from a pharmaceutical standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have any time you hear CBD it's kind
of like a buzzword.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a snake oil industry right now that
95 percent of the products don't even have
[SPEAKER_01]: it in it which is like selling bottles of
like a few ounces for three hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars to someone with cancer saying it's
going to cure their cancer but it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to be very careful when you're
investing in CBD to know it's legal and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's real because there's so many CBD
products cat food products like water
[SPEAKER_01]: products CBD shampoo like all sounds
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah the veterinary side the cosmetic side
it sounds great but it's got to be legal
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's got to be real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not you have to be able to
avoid it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of like my favorite metaphor
I always kind of mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember the late nights as a kid
playing this little game risk you may have
[SPEAKER_01]: seen it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like world domination you know maybe
not the best kind of example to mention in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany here or in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's horrible but you got one shot like we
just opened up the box the boards down all
[SPEAKER_01]: your homies you're all sitting around the
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like where are you going to put your
pieces like where are you going to put
[SPEAKER_01]: your investments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have hundreds of billions I can
just take over everything right now with a
[SPEAKER_01]: billion of additional capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably own 20 plus percent of the
sector for life now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If Constellation had given that to us we
would have pretty much been the only
[SPEAKER_01]: private thing in the world but you know
long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're choosing where to put these
pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you going to double down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you going to go to war and like
fight for that territory for that country
[SPEAKER_01]: for that company because it's only
happening once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you come in with like one little
person on a country and you keep putting
[SPEAKER_01]: more there if you're in the wrong country
you lose everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some sectors are good and some are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to kind of transition into
like talking about which countries and
[SPEAKER_01]: markets now I really think are the most
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So EU is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the countries here in Europe that
are not a part of the European Union
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get into this program are going
to have major problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because I mentioned this morning like
just because you're producing in Macedonia
[SPEAKER_01]: and sell it illegally to someone in Poland
in the EU who then can sell it to Germany
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just because you can do something
doesn't mean it's legal and that you
[SPEAKER_01]: should do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because others are doing
something also doesn't mean that you
[SPEAKER_01]: should be doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they're going towards a cliff
and you're just hooking right on to them
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you're going to get involved in
litigation is on the skyrocketing up and
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to be able to protect
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we're thinking about the EU it's
huge here but it's going to be much slower
[SPEAKER_01]: than people think because things go
through process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently you like papers here in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could do digital and get a driver's
license here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like paperwork paperwork paperwork
the beef farm so much slower but it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: big here if you position yourself
correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: With one of the pieces with with
monitoring of like these these drug
[SPEAKER_01]: programs they're starting the precedent
that what I see Germany and European Union
[SPEAKER_01]: countries doing will essentially emulate
across the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many countries are going to be watching
these countries and here to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're allowing because you've been doing
things so much longer from a regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: basis and copying those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be Chinese hemp
companies selling CBD to like European
[SPEAKER_01]: countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I really see like a European
economy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also knowing that with the EU like
Germany couldn't say hey we're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to allow imports from Portugal or from
somewhere else in the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if it meets those quality
standards you've got that free trade here
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really an interesting opportunity
if you know which laws you're following.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're scheduling and registering
drug products ACMs APIs once you're
[SPEAKER_01]: registering in one country and re
registering that in other countries and
[SPEAKER_01]: part of an API database you're essentially
the Pfizer for cannabis already even as
[SPEAKER_01]: private companies early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in reclassifying CBD this is also like
very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned novel foods before.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have novel foods or
understand what that is and you want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a global CBD player you're wrong and your
company is not going to be able to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: the products that you think and that's
going to be very expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need contract
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a much more lengthy process than
growing some weeds sucking some oils out
[SPEAKER_01]: of them putting them in a pretty bottle in
a pretty box and then just selling it
[SPEAKER_01]: online.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are doing that doesn't mean it's
legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But novelty foods is something that if
you're making edibles products oils
[SPEAKER_01]: manufactured nasal sprays sublinguals
pills anything from CBD it must be under
[SPEAKER_01]: those programs for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So forward thinking compliance don't just
be compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what's the forward regulations you're
going to have to be compliant with with an
[SPEAKER_01]: investment otherwise you're doing it
you're investing you're starting all these
[SPEAKER_01]: jobs and then you can't sell anything and
that's not a good business model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany I love it like the first tinder
process like having a qualification there
[SPEAKER_01]: those first 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having those taken away the only value
that came to me from all of that struggle
[SPEAKER_01]: in Germany years ago was learning all they
care about is quality and the lowest
[SPEAKER_01]: price.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have the ability of saving
governments billions of dollars by
[SPEAKER_01]: producing in low cost countries at the
highest standards they require and
[SPEAKER_01]: importing to those markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not every country needs to grow pineapples
in warehouses to have pineapples like we
[SPEAKER_01]: grow strawberries in some places we ship
them other places we grow blueberries we
[SPEAKER_01]: grow flowers in Colombia which is
indicative of like flowers grow there well
[SPEAKER_01]: but it doesn't necessarily mean if their
standards are not correct that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be able to send to those markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're thinking about what Germany
wants GACP GAP GMP perfect that means if
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Colombia I'd better be doing those
if I'm in Canada I'd better be doing those
[SPEAKER_01]: because that fake GPP will no longer work
in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the problem though here we've got
80 plus million people in Germany but the
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors are not making prescriptions like
we would like them to because you've had
[SPEAKER_01]: to try everything and then you can try
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I love are programs that say anything
your doctor thinks cannabis can help you
[SPEAKER_01]: with you can then make a prescription for
not like you've tried every single other
[SPEAKER_01]: drug product and now everything's failing
this person's dying okay let's try
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really really hard to make a
program but not even a hundred million and
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany's really been hard because people
said it is that benchmark internationally
[SPEAKER_01]: the market they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been
spent on trying to win these tinders or
[SPEAKER_01]: the second round tinder but you'll notice
I didn't apply for one of the last tinders
[SPEAKER_01]: and I mean we got two of the first Danish
licenses we've gotten licenses all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the country I don't even want that here I
just want important distribution that's it
[SPEAKER_01]: because I know that the cost of production
here is going to be so much higher than
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere else in the EU down farther south
your regulations your tax your compliance
[SPEAKER_01]: your VAT it's just like hey let's start
some hemp companies or CBD companies or
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis companies in France you'd be like
it's gonna be very very expensive to
[SPEAKER_01]: operate but if we can just grow it
somewhere else at those standards and
[SPEAKER_01]: import it that's what I want to be doing
you know so it's been years it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: happening these are the main challenges
the doctor education the right perception
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis but even though it's slow
right now just think about what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing now indicative for five years for
ten years that's the that's the timeline I
[SPEAKER_01]: look at like every dollar I put in I don't
care about it for five ten years but I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: just hoping that that's gonna turn into a
hundred dollars or two hundred dollars or
[SPEAKER_01]: three hundred dollars the longer you keep
your money in these markets the better it
[SPEAKER_01]: will do for you now if it's public
companies you're just giving it to a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of Yahoo's to reinvest buy things and sell
things based on what they're speculating
[SPEAKER_01]: they can do and sometimes they can but a
lot of them they knew capital and how to
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulate public markets they did not
know cannabis and that's why you see
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy and Tilray and Aurora making all of
these major acquisitions and sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: garbage like I'm like you spent three
hundred and thirty million dollars on that
[SPEAKER_01]: like shit I think be a little bit smarter
if you're a multi-billion dollar company
[SPEAKER_01]: but startup industries start a public
company so Canada I'm from northern
[SPEAKER_01]: Wisconsin as a kid Canada I appreciate
what they did in starting the first
[SPEAKER_01]: federal kind of medical program like that
I mean other than Uruguay and recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: all adults should have access to cannabis
that they wanted or not like just like
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol or something else we're seeing
alcohol sales have gone down 13 percent in
[SPEAKER_01]: legal states and countries like where this
access is and but Canada unfortunately
[SPEAKER_01]: like they knew there's only 40 million
people here they have a very robust
[SPEAKER_01]: illicit market they started doing
acquisitions all over the world and into
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States the problem though with
Canada is that you've got all these
[SPEAKER_01]: startup companies listing on public
markets that have nothing there reverse
[SPEAKER_01]: splits reverse mergers all of this garbage
and they're acting like they own the world
[SPEAKER_01]: but then many of those companies are
illegal in their filings or in their
[SPEAKER_01]: processes or they're investing into us and
anytime you have a multinational or a
[SPEAKER_01]: foreign national investment investing into
something that's federally illegal that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not good that'd be like hey let's take
some money from Germany and go down to
[SPEAKER_01]: like Izbekistan and start a giant heroin
operation like that's gonna work out
[SPEAKER_01]: really good like not the best but they've
been getting away with it but as soon as
[SPEAKER_01]: the CSE and the TSX start delisting some
of these stocks if you invested into them
[SPEAKER_01]: your money is not in a good place so you
have to be very careful with what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing ETFs are good for like giving
capital like private funds and ETFs like
[SPEAKER_01]: to get your money in and have people who
know the market to put it in but the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem even with like some of those
exchanges is that if you're investing into
[SPEAKER_01]: good companies they're tied in with the
bad companies so then as soon as that
[SPEAKER_01]: market starts to shift or the bubble
bursts even your good companies are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be going down as well that's why
private investments long-term investments
[SPEAKER_01]: are the best places for your capital
currently I kind of like this like once to
[SPEAKER_01]: real listed there publicly like I like
them bringing access to the world but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like Silicon Valley right now and just
because everyone's talking about these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies doesn't mean that what they're
doing is right the amount of companies I
[SPEAKER_01]: see trying to piggyback and copy these
companies over and over again it's not the
[SPEAKER_01]: goal to try to be them what are they
missing what are they not doing and what
[SPEAKER_01]: are they doing wrong and how do you hedge
your bets to position for when they fail
[SPEAKER_01]: like your upside comes like our hedge fund
and Macau should be launched in life by
[SPEAKER_01]: like the third third quarter this year all
we're gonna be doing is just watching
[SPEAKER_01]: their markets and knowing when to short
but I also know that like 90% of those
[SPEAKER_01]: press releases you see are pure garbage
pure lies but no one knows it and then
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hard to find access to information
but I do appreciate any company that's
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to bring medical cannabis to
suffering patients but not just at their
[SPEAKER_01]: detriment or for their profit people plan
at profit like that's true profit not just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to sell somebody a drug that's
gonna keep them alive for longer but cost
[SPEAKER_01]: them $600 a day like some of these other
medications we see but long-term pharma
[SPEAKER_01]: will take this but medical and
recreational cannabis as we know it is one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing pharma is very different and that's
like Epidex Sadov X that's where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going you have to look at both sectors and
be in both but this is the problem you
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot take money from Canada invest into
things that are illegal federally in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States or kind of like the beef
arms been talking or a few other countries
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have a license and you're a public
company or a private company and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: profiting from recreational cannabis and
medical cannabis no longer being able to X
[SPEAKER_01]: like to send medical cannabis to medical
countries so what would that do to till
[SPEAKER_01]: raise stock price to canopy stock price to
Aurora stock price if they no longer can
[SPEAKER_01]: be importing to all these other countries
and then everyone's growing a fuck ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana in Canada that now they can't
sell anywhere else and the price is
[SPEAKER_01]: already like there's almost a thousand
pending licenses they're growing so much
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in Canada and keep lying saying
they have all these shortages to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: getting more investment into it but once
that is all getting established and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much cannabis legal medical and
recreational and eighty plus percent of
[SPEAKER_01]: them can't send it to the rest of the
world it's just going to be like an ocean
[SPEAKER_01]: of water and the chiefs keep filling it
with water so like the prices are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: plummet those companies are going to like
tank many of them go out of business and I
[SPEAKER_01]: hope with our private equity to come in
and buy many of those distressed assets
[SPEAKER_01]: and spread them around the world but
you're going to see the greatest stock
[SPEAKER_01]: market crashes bigger than anything you've
ever seen from Wall Street or any past big
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble crashes in Canada and it's going to
be so detrimental for their entire economy
[SPEAKER_01]: but if a couple of those big assholes are
going to still be billionaires and happy
[SPEAKER_01]: from having manipulated the markets so be
very careful with some of those companies
[SPEAKER_01]: I won two of the first 11 licenses in
Denmark we sold one still have another I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't care about growing in Denmark it's
cold as shit there they work 32 hours a
[SPEAKER_01]: week other than like one month in the
summer like I don't know man like so
[SPEAKER_01]: Denmark the cost reductions high everyone
also thinks it's this huge program it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: pilot research program like the government
lasts a couple weeks goes like the Danish
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicines Agency where's all these
research plans we were supposed to see
[SPEAKER_01]: you're all just Canadians bringing
hundreds of millions of dollars to build
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses here but like it's a pilot
research program yeah they've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest cancer rate per capita yeah
cannabis is gonna be great for them but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not the country to take over the
world with it was just the second country
[SPEAKER_01]: other than Canada that was going to allow
international export that's why we went
[SPEAKER_01]: there but I'm not there I haven't put an
additional dollar in I just made five mil
[SPEAKER_01]: selling a piece of paper it's like so you
have to know which markets and when but
[SPEAKER_01]: like where to double down once you get a
license Greece Macedonia Cyprus Macedonia
[SPEAKER_01]: actually has a very decent program that
just needs to be changed a little bit and
[SPEAKER_01]: could be very advantageous for the world
and for some other countries but when you
[SPEAKER_01]: look at some of these like Cyprus Malta
like that's where you do money laundering
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not where you grow cannabis or wait
they closed that down in like 2009 2012
[SPEAKER_01]: those are not the countries that are going
to take over the world for production
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some advantages there and there's
some patients there that need cannabis but
[SPEAKER_01]: just because there's someone who wants a
pineapple somewhere doesn't need it mean I
[SPEAKER_01]: need to start a pineapple plantation so
when I look at these countries especially
[SPEAKER_01]: with Greece there's opportunity there to
Kuna Lam and a few got some of those first
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses really exciting but some of the
laws they copied from Israel could make
[SPEAKER_01]: their program very very challenging to do
business in the future and it's Greece but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a member of the EU so it could be a
player if it doesn't turn out to be
[SPEAKER_01]: corrupt or have some of those problems you
know Spain we were there for ICBC a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks ago Spain kind of a shit show of a
program as well unfortunately it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to like tolerating coffee house
kind of clubs but they're still years away
[SPEAKER_01]: from a bonafide program now there's a lot
of capital in Spain that wants to get into
[SPEAKER_01]: the market but it's not about the domestic
market in Spain but long term like they
[SPEAKER_01]: know cannabis there but their program has
so many problems just like the Netherlands
[SPEAKER_01]: like they're gonna give 20 coffee house
licenses to start actually growing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and not like importing hash in
your butt to sell on a coffee house there
[SPEAKER_01]: like the current program it's like
tolerated but it's not like legal they're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna legalize that and it's gonna be a
probably a billion two billion dollar
[SPEAKER_01]: market there but Spain it's gonna be a
little bit slower you know Portugal is one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the countries a lot of people are
talking about until raised making a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: weird claims right now about all of their
amazing GMP greenhouses which if you've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen them roll up plastic signs does not
mean GMP and if you don't know what GMP is
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're international you'd better
research it like for how you trim dry
[SPEAKER_01]: process cure package manufacturer it's not
just saying your GMP like it's great to be
[SPEAKER_01]: like we're GMP GACP like you have to know
what those things are and it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that's certified GMP it's your
processes your facilities so in many
[SPEAKER_01]: countries we've just been buying GMP
facilities from other industries
[SPEAKER_01]: repurposing those to easily get our
certifications that's how I've beaten some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these public companies by nine to
twelve months in some of these markets so
[SPEAKER_01]: just remember like Portugal you know there
are two licenses there was a third issued
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple weeks ago for some outdoor
production just because Aurora says that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to be buying some country on
in the Azores that's gonna produce one ton
[SPEAKER_01]: a year that they're applying for they
don't have a license and to see their
[SPEAKER_01]: stock price what that's done Portugal will
be like the lowest cost highest quality
[SPEAKER_01]: production but it's so challenging to get
in that most people don't understand like
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on there or how it's going to
work but for their population I really
[SPEAKER_01]: think that Portugal based on any EU
countries has the best local program
[SPEAKER_01]: because they didn't legalize cannabis they
decriminalized other drugs and legalized
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis so just remember like I
said internationally if you're in this
[SPEAKER_01]: game it's only about medical because the
second you do recreational no longer valid
[SPEAKER_01]: and in the international space Israel's
been big I know Canada tech is going on
[SPEAKER_01]: right now everyone should be at ICBC
because it's way better for what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening but Israel was kind of stuck in
this horrible place for a good amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: years so much research so much development
so much patient focus I love Israel for
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that but now with them being able to
export by the end of the year they think
[SPEAKER_01]: they're now going to be world leaders so
what's that gonna mean a bunch of shitty
[SPEAKER_01]: public companies are gonna list there with
all this speculation that are gonna do
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing be careful about that also be
careful about German exchange now that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is legalizing here all these
startups are gonna try to list publicly to
[SPEAKER_01]: do the same shit that they did in Canada
to make these high market cap companies
[SPEAKER_01]: get tons of investment and redeploy that
in other sectors but that is not how you
[SPEAKER_01]: start public companies like you start
public companies by being a private
[SPEAKER_01]: company and scaling showing revenue
showing real processes and then listing
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook didn't go public day one I mean
any of these big companies it's about
[SPEAKER_01]: position so when we make investments it's
about having lots of pieces to make M&A's
[SPEAKER_01]: mergers and acquisitions that then can pre
IPO and go public those will be huge
[SPEAKER_01]: titans of industry not little startup
two-cent shares maybe a two-cent share
[SPEAKER_01]: company makes it to Amazon but most likely
not and if you find those ones let us know
[SPEAKER_01]: who they are you're gonna see a lot of
companies list in Israel the only thing I
[SPEAKER_01]: really really care about in Israel is like
research and development clinical trials
[SPEAKER_01]: drug discovery like I've got about a 25
million euro play where I'm like drug
[SPEAKER_01]: discovery place in in Israel but I'm not
producing like the cost of reduction there
[SPEAKER_01]: will be so high that I think long term
it's going to be challenging to do real
[SPEAKER_01]: massive production there Latin America's
got a lot of talking right now everyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: really interested in Latin America
Colombia by far has been the country most
[SPEAKER_01]: people have been discussing but we know
that when it comes to some products it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not about producing there and shipping to
other countries but like there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: patients that need medicine there but with
Mexico and Colombia with all this talk
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to what's actually real it's not
as real as most people would think so
[SPEAKER_01]: we're thinking on a lot of those markets
on like starting them but not doubling
[SPEAKER_01]: down for world production you know
Colombia specifically amazing for flower
[SPEAKER_01]: exports with all the licenses though many
companies got the license for analytical
[SPEAKER_01]: testing which then it didn't work really
well for Volkswagen like testing their own
[SPEAKER_01]: cars and saying that they were good and if
you guys remember sorry Germany it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing in Colombia a lot of companies
got that license it's fine to do in-house
[SPEAKER_01]: testing but don't do your own certifying
authority you're voided from UN compacts
[SPEAKER_01]: like if you do that it's a conflict of
interest what I really care about are the
[SPEAKER_01]: non psychoactive licenses for mass outdoor
production for bulk oils and then shipping
[SPEAKER_01]: to other countries the psychoactivity side
like the EU's already said like if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not from indoor or greenhouse or GMP for
the oils those things can't be imported so
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of the Colombian investment plays and
strategies are not going to work and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadians ruined Colombia a little bit by
bringing most of their indoor varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: down to Colombia to grow outside that
we're doing great in warehouses in Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia is a little different to grow
plants outside so I do think Colombia is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be major for a few companies that
do it right but there's so much
[SPEAKER_01]: speculation there that I haven't made
major investments there as of now Africa's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of unfortunately been a shit show I'm
sorry for the language South Africa had
[SPEAKER_01]: the best program moving forward their
government went on strike sapra the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines agency there just got out of
strike there's 21 licenses that were
[SPEAKER_01]: applied for one was disqualified and they
now have a moratorium against new license
[SPEAKER_01]: applications clinical research in South
Africa will be incredible especially with
[SPEAKER_01]: the AIDS rate and what we'll be able to
see with clinical trials there with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and with AIDS research Lesotho
also has like a bonafide program the
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadians also destroyed that by coming
and doing lots of plays but Swaziland
[SPEAKER_01]: Zimbabwe issued those 37 licenses if
anyone's been to Zimbabwe and knows that
[SPEAKER_01]: program it's not also going to be a world
leader it sounds good on a press release
[SPEAKER_01]: but when it gets to boots on the ground
it's not a real program but I think South
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa will be the most bonafide program
within 12 to 18 months in South Africa
[SPEAKER_01]: which I already have applied for a license
there as well Asia's been challenging like
[SPEAKER_01]: you had the first hemp licenses in India
like bang like the source getting to where
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is from in this in this area
unfortunately all I see from like
[SPEAKER_01]: Philippines from Thailand from South Korea
it's all about import I mean right now
[SPEAKER_01]: Vanuatu and some of these other countries
want to have these programs but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: just not creating the programs in a way
that's compliant internationally so when I
[SPEAKER_01]: look at these markets I think import
markets highest standards lowest cost
[SPEAKER_01]: getting medicine to the people who need it
but I still have yet to see a major
[SPEAKER_01]: bonafide investment strategy here and
Australia has had such a challenging
[SPEAKER_01]: program as well that they've been around
for a while in a huge hemp industry but
[SPEAKER_01]: they also other than partnering with a few
Canadians or Israelis haven't through
[SPEAKER_01]: their program laws really been able to
take huge international market share as of
[SPEAKER_01]: now and remember from that risk game like
Australia's only two troops every time so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like you could put all your resources
there but you're gonna get stuck in that
[SPEAKER_01]: little corner and that's hard to get back
out if you guys remember that game so you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I'm almost done here but just
thinking of like we've been talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: this and doing this for over a decade and
there's all these new people or people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are observing this and thinking maybe
I'll get in now or maybe on best a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit into like some public companies to try
to get your feet wet but when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to like navigate this risk and
understand what's happening you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: choose like where you're going to put your
capital and when because time is the one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that we don't have more of and like
opportunity costs you put your time your
[SPEAKER_01]: capital into a market it doesn't go
anywhere you get distracted not every
[SPEAKER_01]: investment works not every country works
not every program works and I've even seen
[SPEAKER_01]: great companies not scale into unicorns
because of some internal things or things
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of their control so diversify your
strategies be in multiple places and know
[SPEAKER_01]: how if you're investing into one company
what services what products what things do
[SPEAKER_01]: they need and how do you invest in a way
to create like circular value versus just
[SPEAKER_01]: like oh this sounds good I'm gonna put
money into it if it's not legal if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not real you're not gonna make anything
from it but we have to do everything
[SPEAKER_01]: making medicine for like our sick
grandparents so like if it's not a good
[SPEAKER_01]: company that thinks about patients first
safe affordable medicine and alternative
[SPEAKER_01]: to pharmaceutical like drugs it's not a
good investment because money is one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: but like what do you do with money it's
like bullets in a gun and you could have
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouses full of bullets but if it's not
on the battlefield at the right time it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't matter and that's where we like
help investors to get their bullets like
[SPEAKER_01]: onto the battlefield to make impact and
profit and get medicine to patients who
[SPEAKER_01]: need it which is the reason we're all in
this room today and always have to
[SPEAKER_01]: remember what you do matters we're
creating an industry to give to future
[SPEAKER_01]: generations so if you're not comfortable
with the products your investments are
[SPEAKER_01]: making if you're sick grandma couldn't
have those products don't do it because
[SPEAKER_01]: this is more of a responsibility of
investment and what we do then just a big
[SPEAKER_01]: money opportunity but there's enough money
for everyone to make this will be larger
[SPEAKER_01]: than tobacco alcohol we're gonna take
major market share from pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_01]: and you want to get into this now in five
years your capital that will be like a
[SPEAKER_01]: cent one euro cent compared to like a 500
euro note for what it could have done for
[SPEAKER_01]: you perfect any time for Q later perfect
thanks everyone very much for letting me
[SPEAKER_00]: share that was so informative thank you
very much the man knows his potatoes I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry we don't have time for questions
we're running a little late I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: speed everything up a little bit don't
