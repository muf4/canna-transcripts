[SPEAKER_05]: And half the room didn't clear out,
so obviously I'm not back home in
[SPEAKER_05]: California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the 420 session on that note.
[SPEAKER_05]: And definitely thank you for all that are
hanging out for the final session here
[SPEAKER_05]: with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So quick introduction about myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Stokes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I finally get to be a moderator versus a
panelist.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the first time for me in five
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: My background in the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally grew up in northern California,
so was awarded a PhD in always around the
[SPEAKER_05]: craft and the culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting enough, studied criminology in
college, so it wasn't necessarily the path
[SPEAKER_05]: I was originally going to take,
but that's a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now currently, I'm the head of the herbal
category for Boveda, and formerly director
[SPEAKER_05]: of media at a little tech company called
Weed Maps out of Southern California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, kind of a big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then before that, started with a
friend, the first mainstream news site
[SPEAKER_05]: called The Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of Denver, Colorado, back when the
first adult use market started.
[SPEAKER_05]: But enough about me, we'll jump right into
our panelists, and we will start with
[SPEAKER_05]: ladies first, if that's okay, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to start off with Tyler Sally,
if you could tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_05]: yourself and your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, hi everybody, my name is Tyler
Sally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a cannabis brand called Juices 22.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lifestyle brand, and underneath the
lifestyle, we promote cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have multiple products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we are gonna launch in different
states across America, and eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome, and then Mr. Charles Feldman,
also from the states, if you can introduce
[SPEAKER_05]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Charles Feldman.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to say my cannabis career started
about 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a federal prosecutor in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_09]: That wasn't enough for me, so I had to
join the DEA, and I was a task force
[SPEAKER_09]: commander for the DEA.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is, you can start, sometimes the
audience actually boos me right about
[SPEAKER_09]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bachelor number three, I think you've been
asked to leave the stage.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was exactly speaking to the lapel a
little louder.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did narcotics prosecution, also after
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: By then I'd had my fill of government,
started my own law firm, we got into
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis about 10 years ago, working with
some high net worth clients.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I like to describe a little bit of
atonement for me personally, being able to
[SPEAKER_09]: now work on the other side of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Being able to use a lot of those skills
that we used early on in the war on drugs
[SPEAKER_09]: environment, to help our clients navigate
some really difficult international
[SPEAKER_09]: regulations, international landscapes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, it's been a very fascinating journey
for me, both personally, and being part of
[SPEAKER_09]: this enormous social experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I work with a international strategy
company, navigating cannabis and hemp all
[SPEAKER_09]: around the world, whether it's capital
funding, marrying up those two partners,
[SPEAKER_09]: or actually just building a good workable
strategy that produces profit.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, tiny little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a good segue to Immanuel Kotzian from
Hempf Media, all the way across the pond,
[SPEAKER_05]: coming from Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Immanuel Kotzian.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 25 years ago, I started making
legalization work for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a few years, I noticed I have to
generate some kind of job to go on
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we found a company called Aginto
Soviet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Soviet is the publisher of the biggest
hemp magazine in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is now 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those 20 years, a lot things
happened, a lot of adventures we mastered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are now in a very interesting
position on the German market,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the medicinal cannabis legalization
and a lot of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still hoping on more cannabis coming
from Canada, but also from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please send your product to Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll bring it back to this side
of the pond with Vincent Diacoletti,
[SPEAKER_05]: out of New York and LA.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys, co-founder of Show Products.
[SPEAKER_08]: We started in the industry with extraction
equipment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most notable brand we have is Rosentech
Products.
[SPEAKER_08]: We kind of completed the circle to
incorporate about 1,200 skews of ancillary
[SPEAKER_08]: products.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have distribution in Czech
Republic, Guadalajara, Mexico and LA.
[SPEAKER_08]: We truly are a global company and we
service multiple countries every day of
[SPEAKER_08]: the week.
[SPEAKER_08]: And our goal is to kind of unite the
cultures of the world through cannabis and
[SPEAKER_08]: create some long lasting brands in the
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And definitely last but not least,
we'll bring it back home to Mr. Darren
[SPEAKER_05]: Gill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my career in cannabis started when I
was 16 and I thought growing weed was as
[SPEAKER_02]: simple as buying a light in a grow tent
off of eBay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Failed miserably at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spent 11 years in global manufacturing and
supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joined Deloitte, focused on M&A,
where I helped on both sides of some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the largest transactions that have taken
place in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then much like this, I had a panel,
met the former CEO of Namaste
[SPEAKER_02]: Technologies, fell in love with their
story and their model around partnership
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm currently their chief strategy
officer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll kick it right off.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some interesting topics.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the green room with us, someone started
talking about politics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who chose that topic,
but we definitely will get into something
[SPEAKER_05]: a bit fun and strategic partnerships.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something just on a personal front
is a huge factor in my mind coming from
[SPEAKER_05]: the media space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Similar to what HOMF has done quite
successfully on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_05]: pond, I always saw a huge success in
collaborating with other brands,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially like-minded and those that have
similar core values and beliefs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's huge in order for everyone to
move everything forward in this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think kind of bouncing off to Vince
to start here, the question that we have
[SPEAKER_05]: to start off with is what makes partnering
in the industry a win-win for all parties
[SPEAKER_05]: involved?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's not always a win-win.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely not always a win-win.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to be careful who you partner with
because there's a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_08]: aren't interested in a win-win.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would say aligning your interests and
aligning what both companies are looking
[SPEAKER_08]: for, their core values at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can align the values of both
company of what they're looking to
[SPEAKER_08]: accomplish and keep those aligned,
those are the best partnerships that we've
[SPEAKER_08]: had so far.
[SPEAKER_08]: When our interests aren't aligned,
that's when we usually run into some
[SPEAKER_08]: issues with going back to the contract and
trying to hash things out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually, when your interests are aligned,
you don't really need to reference your
[SPEAKER_08]: contract that often.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have open communication, and if
there's any issues that arise,
[SPEAKER_08]: you can call up the other party and try to
work it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because at the end of the day,
if you guys are both aligned, you're
[SPEAKER_08]: trying to move forward, you're not trying
to create road bumps and hiccups for the
[SPEAKER_08]: other party.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would say just aligning your
interests would be the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also the same question for you,
Tyler.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that she's doing right now is
cross-aligning.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the things that you're looking
for in those partnerships as you expand
[SPEAKER_05]: your brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, when I try to build partnerships,
I want to make sure that the company that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go in business with is
somebody or a group of people that not
[SPEAKER_01]: only bring innovation, but they also bring
that operation side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need somebody that you have to be
able to see the vision with me and help me
[SPEAKER_01]: move further, as well as whatever you
bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be able to want to grow bigger
and see past whatever we're hiring you
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the most important
thing because you can't really plan for
[SPEAKER_01]: the next 10 years, but you can plan for
how or who you're going to be with in the
[SPEAKER_01]: next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then from a little different angle,
Charles, we hear a lot of acronyms as we
[SPEAKER_05]: get into these partnerships, whether it be
MOUs and NDAs and the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But from a legal standpoint, what are some
of the things that you recommend for even
[SPEAKER_05]: the simplest partnerships?
[SPEAKER_09]: Partnerships are marriages.
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes in business, they're even
more important, more devastating,
[SPEAKER_09]: more rewarding than some of your own
personal relationships.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've always tried to advise my clients,
look at a partnership from a very personal
[SPEAKER_09]: perspective, look at the context of what
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you similarly situated or is one
unequal to the other partner?
[SPEAKER_09]: What is your exit strategy?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm always preaching from the very
beginning of that partnership.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you going to exit?
[SPEAKER_09]: When are you going to exit?
[SPEAKER_09]: What does that look like for you?
[SPEAKER_09]: What does that look like for your partner?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are the two aligned?
[SPEAKER_09]: Making sure you've done a real proper
vetting.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of it is just common business tools
that you should bring into this industry,
[SPEAKER_09]: no different than you would in any other
typical partnership.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Emmanuel, yours is a little
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we've actually had a
partnership before in a past life at one
[SPEAKER_05]: of my companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: How is it internationally to do
partnerships, especially when some things
[SPEAKER_05]: are lost in translation and obviously laws
as they pertain to your country versus
[SPEAKER_05]: another country that you might be working
with an entity at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, before getting in real contact,
I try to find out if my partner,
[SPEAKER_00]: if my possible partner is really aware of
the legal situation of his product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for me a key question because I
see a lot of companies which have really
[SPEAKER_00]: good products, but might be they are not
really 100% sure if they are legal or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm ready to overtake a part of the
risk, but I would like to know before
[SPEAKER_00]: which part of the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the international cooperation,
I try to find partners who have knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: a heuristic knowledge about the products
and also an opinion about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask them also if they have at least
one lawyer who confirms it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to have an idea about if
something is legal or not, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest problem in European community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Officially, we have the same law,
the same directives, but I have 27
[SPEAKER_00]: different languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry, it's 29 altogether in 27
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Police officers, registration officers,
which are talking total different
[SPEAKER_00]: interpretation, cultural, cultural
interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cannot expect an administrative
officer working for the French government
[SPEAKER_00]: to accept a German stamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have to redo it and redo the
process of legalizing my product or my
[SPEAKER_00]: theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a key question for me about if
it's legal and we try to stay on the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: side, then the exit strategy is not that
risky, I would say.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then back to you, Darren.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saving the best for last, man,
I promise.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as far as partnerships from province to
province, maybe even from province to
[SPEAKER_05]: state, any sort of feedback on best
practices there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think one of the things,
you know, around strategic partnerships is
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure you find somebody that fills
a gap and has an actual value proposition
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things we're trying to do at
CanMart is position ourselves to help LPs
[SPEAKER_02]: that aren't necessarily interested in the
processing and sales aspect, but really
[SPEAKER_02]: focused on cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually had a press release even
come out today that talks about how we're
[SPEAKER_02]: now into the BC government and looking to
expand into other channels.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a unique position where we're not
a cultivator ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody in this room potentially is
an industry partner for us to be working
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do is basically act as the middle
agent to be able to help you get
[SPEAKER_02]: processing services, get the product
packaged, make sure it's compliant,
[SPEAKER_02]: take you through the testing, and work to
be able to bid into the governments.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have an e-coms platform,
so we partner with a whole host of LPs and
[SPEAKER_02]: industry folks to be able to sell direct
to consumer medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, being able to get into
those channels, do the bid list,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if we look at the way any other
public sector has gone, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: healthcare being a great example,
you went from hundreds of suppliers trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to supply the health authorities to
they've got three or four main
[SPEAKER_02]: distributors that they're working with
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're able to go to the provincial
governments to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not interested in competing with
any of the partner companies with a
[SPEAKER_02]: catalog offering of all of your brands
because we're not interested in competing
[SPEAKER_02]: in that space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something I'd say as well for
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't just target one segment of the
actual industry, and that's beneficial to
[SPEAKER_05]: your point because everyone in this room
can be a client, you know, definitely on
[SPEAKER_05]: the B2B side.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still a great factor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you segued into the next question
perfectly, and I'll pass this on to Vince.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go in order here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for your company in specific,
Vince, and you're a little diverse as
[SPEAKER_05]: well, what do you actually bring with your
respective products to the table,
[SPEAKER_05]: and what is the ideal partner that you
would say fits that?
[SPEAKER_08]: The ideal partner really, it varies in
what sector of our business we're talking
[SPEAKER_08]: about, but for an ancillary distribution
side, which is our strongest division
[SPEAKER_08]: right now, I would say a strong brand
product.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of the consumer goods in the
cannabis space can be kind of chintzy and
[SPEAKER_08]: non-branded type items in the smoke shop
market particularly I'm talking about,
[SPEAKER_08]: like consumption type devices.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we strive as partners is we're not
looking to distribute the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_08]: barrel type products.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking for actual products that
have branding, marketing budgets,
[SPEAKER_08]: a sales team, presence at trade shows,
bringing more to the table than just a
[SPEAKER_08]: product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great response because that's the same
thing we're looking for as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Tyler likewise, but again,
you know, the fact that you're cross
[SPEAKER_05]: licensing and expanding and already I
believe in three states but looking for
[SPEAKER_05]: future states and future countries,
what are some of the challenges in finding
[SPEAKER_05]: that ideal partner being that laws and
regulations vary and even demographics and
[SPEAKER_05]: geographical factors play in as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like that it's different in each
place because then I can have my products
[SPEAKER_01]: be specific to that city or state wherever
I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the best partner that I can
have is someone who can provide what they
[SPEAKER_01]: say they can provide whenever I need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times in cannabis,
I feel like there's a lot of hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will say, okay,
I can give you this, this, this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it comes down to it,
you might not get the product that you
[SPEAKER_01]: originally agreed upon or it might not
come tasting the same or looking the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the most important is someone with
consistency as a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think going state by state for me,
I know that in Arizona, they're more
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on a medicinal side with nursing
home products for people with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: ailments and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in California, it's one of the
biggest markets, but you can get anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go on the recreational side where
it's just more chilling or you can also
[SPEAKER_01]: get a topical for your back pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think having a brand that goes state
by state is important for me because I can
[SPEAKER_01]: have unique products in each state as
opposed to just being generic completely
[SPEAKER_01]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll kind of morph this a little bit
because a lot of people don't know there's
[SPEAKER_05]: 40 countries around the world that have
either legalized or deregulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: A good example is Portugal that
technically de-scheduled all drugs and
[SPEAKER_05]: then launched a medical cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Michael, we've talked about a little
bit of the international.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of the challenges you have
as far as working over borders and
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding this kind of segue is a
little bit of what we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the laws and regulations that
you're having to deal with from obviously
[SPEAKER_05]: market to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I mentioned before, please,
you have such an advantage in the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have one language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine you should print your flyer in 27
languages just in the European community.
[SPEAKER_00]: With particularly, officially,
it's the same regulation, but you will
[SPEAKER_00]: find out different country, different
translation, different interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, we work worldwide,
but we try to concentrate on the countries
[SPEAKER_00]: which we understand better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some countries are really
difficult to be understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see, of course, different
countries makes it easier to registrate
[SPEAKER_00]: and to get in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this moment, we see Germany is more or
less a consumer market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're waiting for the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even it's not easy to pass the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you pass the border, like it was on
the panel before, I can confirm with a
[SPEAKER_00]: German stamp within the European
community, you are a lot more comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: to go somewhere else with your product
than with a stamp, let's say, from a small
[SPEAKER_00]: country with one exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: My big recommendation, really,
have a look on Luxembourg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have announced they want to have the
full regulation and I talked just eight
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks ago to the Minister of Health,
Etienne Schneider.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just on the trip to Canada to have
a look how it's working here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him, yeah, please also ask
those who are working with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're also already developing
one step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make the same mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each country needs also a regulating
system which accords to the local
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot compare Luxembourg with Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the big plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no borders anymore between
Luxembourg and Germany and France.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luxembourg is a great place to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a strategic position.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach each point of the European
community within 24 hours with your
[SPEAKER_00]: parcel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they regulate the right way,
you have a really wonderful hub in the
[SPEAKER_00]: European community in the center of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please use it also to supply Germany or
France.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I think that's one thing he's
talking on for those who didn't get the
[SPEAKER_05]: memo that Luxembourg did announce
legalization of adult use to come into
[SPEAKER_05]: effect hopefully by 2022.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the fact that Canada has been quite an
influence, right, and some of the things
[SPEAKER_05]: happening globally, being a Commonwealth
country, France has announced a medical
[SPEAKER_05]: beta program.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ireland finally has come around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, England announced as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Charles, some of the legal things that
come into play, because all of us have
[SPEAKER_05]: talked about dabbling in the
international.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of us already do, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: What, again, are the challenges that you
see even logistically with doing business
[SPEAKER_05]: even just across the pond over to a place
like Europe?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think most of what my strategy company
that I'm a part of, we talk with clients
[SPEAKER_09]: the most about is just context.
[SPEAKER_09]: The international community is so
exciting.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so much sex appeal to it of being
an international brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: But unless you truly can grasp the
context, I mean, just listening to some of
[SPEAKER_09]: these key experts talk about practicing on
an international scale, it gets really
[SPEAKER_09]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how complicated it is just in
your own jurisdiction where you operate
[SPEAKER_09]: right now, whether that's a local city or
a providence or a state, when you move
[SPEAKER_09]: outside and you're crossing international
borders and you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_09]: international drug control treaties and UN
and some of the speakers talked about it
[SPEAKER_09]: earlier, it truly gets complicated.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as my fellow speaker here is talking
about, if you're a company that is really
[SPEAKER_09]: focused on compliance and being 100%
compliant in whatever area you're
[SPEAKER_09]: operating in, truly grasping that context,
is vitally important.
[SPEAKER_09]: As you continue to grow and your success
grows, that level of compliance becomes
[SPEAKER_09]: even more important.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've seen a lot of great companies make
considerable revenue.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're on this upswing and then have some
real compliance hidden skeleton in their
[SPEAKER_09]: background that really makes that
difficult to continue that level of
[SPEAKER_09]: revenue growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So another question, and we obviously know
some obvious, for the Canadian market,
[SPEAKER_05]: I would probably say Lyft.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the U.S., it's definitely MJ Biz.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think even for Emmanuel, maybe Spanibus
or Mary Jane or Kenifest.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what are some of the other places for
individuals in the crowd that are looking
[SPEAKER_05]: to establish strategic partnerships or
grow strategic partnerships?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of the places that you would
recommend to search out these contacts in
[SPEAKER_05]: these companies?
[SPEAKER_05]: Short of a Google search, is there any
sort of secrets that you might have?
[SPEAKER_05]: And what could those be that have really
helped you out?
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, we'll start with you,
Darren, if that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I think the biggest place that's
helped me out is looking through your own
[SPEAKER_02]: personal network.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the degrees of separation within
this industry are fairly small.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you usually know a guy who knows a guy
very similar to back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So reach out to the folks around you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of companies that have been
trailblazers, and being a trailblazer is
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the risk you take getting out in front
of the pack is getting burnt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So learn from others' mistakes,
roll that into what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: and develop a sound strategy and approach
that really requires focus and picking the
[SPEAKER_02]: verticals that you want to take on and
really own, and looking for the right
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships around you to be able to
help fill in the rest of the gaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as we've seen time and time again,
no one company can do everything well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very well put.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll continue on down the line with
Vince.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of your feedback on that as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think he said it really well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really have much to add that he
kind of stole the words out of my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I would add is know your
strengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, you have to be honest with
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I good at and what am I not good
at?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to find someone who is good
at what you are not good at, or else it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, he pretty much summed it all
up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I would continue to add the
vetting process.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think it is so important,
especially in a lot of the work that I've
[SPEAKER_09]: done either legally for clients or helping
clients build strategy, is truly vetting
[SPEAKER_09]: the information that you get.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a great industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got great people in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But like any other industry, there are a
lot of snake oil salesmen.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a lot of people who are just
looking for the quick dollar.
[SPEAKER_09]: I constantly, again, go back to just
common business practices, like it would
[SPEAKER_09]: be in any other industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Vet that information.
[SPEAKER_09]: Know who you're getting involved with.
[SPEAKER_09]: Know what that background is.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's coming from the legacy community,
know what that means.
[SPEAKER_09]: Truly know what is coming forward as you
build out your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, watch to add more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put time into it, into making the
connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're investing from the first day of our
existence time into international
[SPEAKER_00]: networking, because we know exactly this
is a global market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first 10 years, we need to find
out who is really active in Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: in our neighbor countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're on a level to invest a lot
of time joining around the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: From show to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, by the way, recommend ICPC events,
because it's B2B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very happy about a Berlin event,
because the whole planet is coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: Berlin, and it saves my travel costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which the Berlin show is a very good show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I cannot recommend one special show or
a secret show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are that many popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have at least 50 in Europe going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was four months ago in Ukraine,
and I was super surprised by the high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of the convention there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, you cannot predict that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the market in Ukraine is very far
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't think next day you can make
return on investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But super interesting countries,
super interesting possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to invest time and to develop
trust to our content.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to add that the networking at
the events, I know you said other than the
[SPEAKER_08]: events, but the networking at the events
is really key.
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially for three years, basically from
2015 to 2018, I didn't have a home.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went from trade show to trade show.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't stay in one place for more than
six days.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a book in my calendar.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't stay in one place for more than
six days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Over that course of three years,
I built a worldwide network that I lean on
[SPEAKER_08]: every day still.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that network that I continue to build
and be at these trade shows is really my
[SPEAKER_08]: biggest asset in this industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because like he said, we really are like a
degree of separation from someone.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you ask around about someone,
someone else knows whether they're good,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're bad, what their strengths are,
what their weaknesses are.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would just say vet people out through
the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still a small industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still an intimate industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still not that many of us at the top
or players in the game.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just lean on your fellow network and
that would be my advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to add one thing around
the whole vetting bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of advisors and everybody's
an expert in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vet your advisors as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes them an advisor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just became a cannabis advisor
yesterday?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the things that I've seen
time and time again personally and other
[SPEAKER_02]: companies as well is all too often the way
you ask the question will change the
[SPEAKER_02]: answer you get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also make sure what you're trying to
achieve and that you're asking those
[SPEAKER_02]: questions the right way because it'll
often, you know, you can talk to five
[SPEAKER_02]: people and get five different answers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's spot on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think exactly what Vince,
what you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those of us have been on the circuit and
same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been on for five years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did 30 shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: My division I had do 68 shows,
but 30 of them I worked for the exact same
[SPEAKER_05]: reason you speak because you have to get
out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to build your network and your
network has net worth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you are a company or an entity that
has the vetting and the testing,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, you know, you have to look for
investors that want to get into this
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, look for someone who does have
that network because it is such an
[SPEAKER_05]: advantage, an exponential advantage to
move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a few things we talked about
in the green room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tyler mentioned it's interesting because I
compare a partnership to a marriage just
[SPEAKER_05]: like what was said in the green room as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Tyler said, you know, I'm also looking
for what I don't want in a partner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it isn't any different than your
personal life.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I explained this my little second
cousins are now 23.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I said you know you don't go through
life knowing exactly what you do want.
[SPEAKER_05]: You realize what you don't want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's applicable in so many situations
and this one very much just as much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely excellent feedback kind of
segueing into how does a business in this
[SPEAKER_05]: is definitely a little wild because it's
applicable different to individuals on
[SPEAKER_05]: this board because some of us are focused
on widgets on tangible goods and others
[SPEAKER_05]: are not intangibles right services versus
goods.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a good question is you know how does a
business generate net profits and actual
[SPEAKER_05]: valuations in the global space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we'll again we'll start at the
opposite end with Emmanuel first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry but I did not understand really a
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you obviously so you offer a service.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say more so than a true tangible
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where do you actually pull a net profit
or a positive out of that from a
[SPEAKER_05]: partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah what what we really can offer as a
net profit is of course our possibility to
[SPEAKER_00]: advertise into marketing within our
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each partner can really profit out of
this and it's an easy thing to drop this
[SPEAKER_00]: into a partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is like yeah we can we can repeat
this and we hope that our partners see the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing just faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this is a big advantage and
through this through this possibilities of
[SPEAKER_00]: also being very open with with this kind
of services.
[SPEAKER_00]: We generated a lot of cooperation might be
just small cooperation but spreading the
[SPEAKER_00]: information about your product about each
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes a nice situation a nice mood for
maybe making more together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very simple thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It don't cost a lot from our side and
makes open doors for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Charles I know it's maybe a slight
variance on this question for you but
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe even as a third party as being that
individual from a counselor legal side.
[SPEAKER_05]: What things do you you kind of point out
as far as where it's rewarding for both
[SPEAKER_05]: parties and partnerships.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I answer that question with a lot
of times we're value add because we're
[SPEAKER_09]: telling you what you don't want to hear.
[SPEAKER_09]: Having been from the complete other side
of this industry having fully embraced
[SPEAKER_09]: this industry in really looking for ways
that we're not just making money but we're
[SPEAKER_09]: actually helping you accomplish what it is
you are out to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not always easy to do and it's there
are a lot of yes people out there who are
[SPEAKER_09]: just going to tell you whatever you want
to hear.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to make millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to change the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to cure cancer and not all of
us are going to get to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really being able to have professional
services around you that are true that are
[SPEAKER_09]: honest authentic and are going to tell you
things that you don't want to hear I've
[SPEAKER_09]: found have been real value to our clients
have saved them lots of money time pain
[SPEAKER_09]: energy along the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Tyler obviously from a cross
licensing or brand partnership the
[SPEAKER_05]: benefits there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like my role on the brand side is
to help educate as much as possible and
[SPEAKER_01]: destigmatize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's if anything a brand can do
is help the cannabis movement move forward
[SPEAKER_01]: in a positive light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my biggest mission in anything
cannabis is to make sure that I'm teaching
[SPEAKER_01]: people how great this plan is but I'm also
getting rid of all of the negative that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were originally taught.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think for for us on the ancillary
distribution side our biggest value add is
[SPEAKER_08]: that we we have a sales team with current
relationships with over five thousand
[SPEAKER_08]: retail shops across the globe.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we do identify a potential product
that we think fits into our catalog we can
[SPEAKER_08]: bring that to to the doors of many shops
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the other thing and kind of what he
touched on is that we're very upfront.
[SPEAKER_08]: If your product doesn't work we're going
to tell you this is wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: The boxing's wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: This doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like not in a negative way but we we
offer like a brand acceleration program
[SPEAKER_08]: also.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll help you if if we think there's
value there to to reformat your packaging
[SPEAKER_08]: or readjust your margins and whatever is
wrong with the product that we don't think
[SPEAKER_08]: is going to work will adjust it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So kind of giving you the truth on whether
your product is going to make it in market
[SPEAKER_08]: or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know I think two years ago the way
I would have answered this question is a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot different than today when you had easy
access to capital and you could sneeze the
[SPEAKER_02]: word cannabis and raise five million bucks
in a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact is in today's market where you
know there's a lot of headwinds and a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more challenges that getting access to
capital there's really three things that I
[SPEAKER_02]: think about and it goes back to focus
leverage and choices and focus to me is
[SPEAKER_02]: pick where you want to fit in the value
chain what you really really want to
[SPEAKER_02]: specialize on and execute that business
plan have a strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I think like we've heard other
panelists talk about how are you going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get out of this business.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you doing this and really have
those things defined and written down and
[SPEAKER_02]: they may change over time but making sure
you stay true to your business plan
[SPEAKER_02]: leverages once you've invested in
something make sure that you find new ways
[SPEAKER_02]: of leveraging that investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us at Canmar we were originally a
direct to consumer ecoms platform for
[SPEAKER_02]: medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well hey great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got this facility I've got a license
that can do processing and sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I not not selling into rec.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can I use this as an upsell to other
LPs as a value add service.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one is choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know sometimes it's a very exciting
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get opportunities coming
out your left right and center but picking
[SPEAKER_02]: and choosing which ones you're going to
take and ultimately being able to say no
[SPEAKER_02]: and walk away from opportunities to stay
true to your business plan is hugely
[SPEAKER_02]: important because you may miss an
opportunity here but you may run out of
[SPEAKER_02]: capital bandwidth or just energy to
execute on the other parts that were a
[SPEAKER_02]: fundamental part of your business when you
started off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you've got to really stay true
to a strategy once you've laid it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is you know not to sound like a
strategy guy but when you plan something
[SPEAKER_02]: out for two to three years there's a
reason you're going down that road and
[SPEAKER_02]: shifting every week or two months because
something new and hot's come up isn't the
[SPEAKER_02]: right way to execute on a business.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's spot on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually I have a good example of what
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know we're a again very big on
strategic partnerships at Bowman and we
[SPEAKER_05]: found that we're growing out of one
partnership but we found someone that
[SPEAKER_05]: takes that place almost with the 10 acts
as far as what the attribute from both
[SPEAKER_05]: sides.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not one sided but it's a very good
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't feel like you're constantly locked
in and what a lot of us do because the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry is still small enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of us know this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean the fact that that there's
relationships up here from different
[SPEAKER_05]: countries is a good example of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't lock yourself in.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of these are gentlemen agreements.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them are handshakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully not loaded handshakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might establish an NDA or again an MOU
to work together but leaving yourself an
[SPEAKER_05]: open end or some sort of clause because
all of a sudden someone's business
[SPEAKER_05]: strategy changes yourself included and you
need to be able to adapt and move the ship
[SPEAKER_05]: accordingly.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No it's been a huge part of what we've
been trying to do with our direct to
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know we made a choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We launched out and we had our own branded
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We realized if we're truly trying to be an
industry partner and partner with LPs I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't have a competing product when I'm
trying to sell yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made a conscious decision to stop that
work so we can focus on the relationship
[SPEAKER_02]: with the LPs because that's what was
important to our business strategy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spot on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this gets the next question a little
more detailed and I'll give an example.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know for us above it I'm very
fortunate that we've got a phenomenal R&D
[SPEAKER_05]: team.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the things that we do when we
partner because everyone we consider
[SPEAKER_05]: partners not customers for success but we
actually offer a service where we do leak
[SPEAKER_05]: down tests on LPs packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to make sure to maintain the
quality and consistency of the product to
[SPEAKER_05]: maintain that moisture.
[SPEAKER_05]: But obviously we all know air and light is
the other two things that further and
[SPEAKER_05]: expedite the degradation of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a specific attribute that we
bring to a partnership.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there one specific attribute that you
kind of have as that ace up your sleeve
[SPEAKER_05]: that you find pulling out and putting on
the table more often than not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can go back down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: No definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for us the biggest ace up our
sleeve is that direct to consumer access
[SPEAKER_02]: and the fact that we take care of customer
service technology development and product
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the three areas that we want to
play and that's where our focus is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from from that portion that's that's
the strongest value add that we bring to
[SPEAKER_02]: our partners.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say also our distribution network
of direct to consumer and also the fact
[SPEAKER_08]: that our team has our finger on the pulse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our team is extremely knowledgeable
depending on which sector of our team.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have a lot of knowledge and our
finger on the pulse and industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So knowledge finger on the pulse and our
distribution network be our strong suits
[SPEAKER_01]: produces are I feel like our biggest
strength right now is marketing and making
[SPEAKER_01]: sure there is a positive brand association
with our brand and just getting the name
[SPEAKER_01]: out getting everywhere and making sure
that people will see deuces and
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately know that they can try and
trust us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that we've been
trying to push for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also feel like there are certain
products that I know I need to find the
[SPEAKER_01]: best version of this because there's the
market is flooded with the greatest vapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I need to know which vape is the best
vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's something that we've
really tried to figure out is what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: best products for us to get involved in
and how to get those products as many
[SPEAKER_01]: places as possible without like over
saturating the market.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea what the question is.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are our strengths?
[SPEAKER_05]: Your ace up the sleeve as far as for your
specific business that you bring to the
[SPEAKER_05]: table negotiating strategic partnerships.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say for us said at GPS global it
would be authenticity.
[SPEAKER_09]: So whatever we're going to talk about
whatever we're going to give you is going
[SPEAKER_09]: to be authentic.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to sell you something we
can't deliver.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to promise something that
is unreachable.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to build a strategy that
is that is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's truly going to come from a very
grounded place of authenticity.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen so many consultants out there
who truly come from the last failed three
[SPEAKER_09]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so now they're a consultant.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who said that down there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate that your professional services.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it's your lawyer your accountant
your consultant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sure you know where they're coming
from and where this advice that is
[SPEAKER_09]: supposedly so expensive where that's
coming from and why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it's difficult to answer because we
have no 20 years of history with this
[SPEAKER_00]: business and it's not easy to when we
started it was easier to exact define we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to expand the information and we
overtook some some kind of leadership in
[SPEAKER_00]: this information building information
spreading in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the as the process the market
became bigger the challenges became
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our like main topic is still to keep
keep ahead with the information because we
[SPEAKER_00]: built up a huge database of information
about regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: About products exactly persons players
organizations and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: A huge data collection in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying really to update it daily
and to get some more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a totally no go for us is when our
partner cannot tell me a story about his
[SPEAKER_00]: product when is a soul less product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot promote it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a no go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just have a price list that's
that's too less for for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some real story behind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the moral of the story is
definitely do your homework.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't mean to pick on consultants
but all of us have come across them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had one in L.A.
[SPEAKER_05]: She is an industry expert looked at her
LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a Pilates instructor last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we mean to pick on
consultants that are have knowledge spread
[SPEAKER_08]: but yes consulting and you're out there
pretending to be a consultant like I'll
[SPEAKER_08]: pick on you like don't don't be there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't be giving people false information
like you will call you out at one point
[SPEAKER_08]: like come across someone that knows their
information and pretend to be a
[SPEAKER_08]: consultant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like cool I'll call you out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have nothing against calling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I think some of them they pull from
their experience this one in specific said
[SPEAKER_05]: well you know I've been consuming cannabis
in size 14.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said well I've been using a restroom
since I was born and I'm not a urologist.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I just so you guys know I was in
my college town for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not get a doctorate but that's
exactly it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just do your homework is what we're
getting at.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's kind of the overarching
message here is do your homework when you
[SPEAKER_05]: come into a partnership.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't Tinder.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't just swipe right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not just DTF.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not just down to have fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that's so hopefully
hopefully somewhat of a long term.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to get a little light headed to the
end of the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys if you haven't smoked you should.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's one of those things where you just
have to take it serious though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of it more of match dot com or
farmers dot com whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to actually do a little homework
get a little background get to know him.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean you have to be married
with him forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the two thousands.
[SPEAKER_05]: But still at least do deal due diligence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if not Vince will call your ass out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's segue into some Q&A.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll keep it a little light.
[SPEAKER_05]: We definitely have a few minutes I think
for questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike's gonna be coming around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear from the panel one more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone have any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why you have to sit so far away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called exercise a long day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work comfy shoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the important question for the
panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wondering what you guys see as some of the
most strategic and important strategic
[SPEAKER_07]: partnerships that you can have right now
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course this could go company by
company.
[SPEAKER_07]: So please it could be individual or it
could be an overarching for us all
[SPEAKER_05]: starting as packages packaging the
packaging division companies like E pack
[SPEAKER_05]: and to packed kush bottles Green Lane some
of the biggest players.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're obvious partners to us because
it's like chocolate and peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that's where our product
typically goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No for us it's focusing on value add
services.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know we've got a relationship with
Shopify.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a partnership with my friends at
Boveda.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work on accessories.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we work with Green Lane.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know we've got a strong ecoms
platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got relationships with a whole host
of LPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've got the widest product
selection for medical cannabis available
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere right now on our website from LP
and skew count.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're continuing to grow it and you
know sign new partners up every week.
[SPEAKER_08]: For us it's strong products strong brands
that we can distribute.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then on the extraction equipment
quality process.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us it's making sure that it's quality
flour or whatever we're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need that's like the most important
thing to me something that I will smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I'll give someone else to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I need to be able to trust the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the most important
relationship I have as a brand is to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to have flour and say yes I believe
in this here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try this please.
[SPEAKER_09]: We love the growers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say a an actual strategy a road
map to profits.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you don't know from where you are to
where you're trying to go and you don't
[SPEAKER_09]: have a road map of how you're going to
create actual net revenues then you got to
[SPEAKER_09]: rethink your business plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that'd be the simplest way I could
answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy to add something on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean strong brands the quality of the
grass is really very very important for
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give up the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it take your time to perform for some
years as still a lot of market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the first plan isn't a success
there's still time for another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we had one more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there one more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're practicing your baseball practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: My underhand baseball.
[SPEAKER_04]: My Sub Mariner swing.

[SPEAKER_06]: Just wondering do you do pre-rolls at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something you guys are processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friend Aaron in the back there can
