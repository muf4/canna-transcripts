[SPEAKER_04]: Love that shout-out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Ngaio.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Alex, for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I'm really looking forward to this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to talk about regulations in
Canada, regulations in Germany,
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations in Switzerland, and
regulations in a bunch of other countries
[SPEAKER_04]: as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: First up, we have Ben Arne.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the CEO of KanaTrade, based in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Emanuel Kotzin is the CEO of Empalico,
which is actually a brand underneath
[SPEAKER_04]: Soviet, which has really awesome little
design features, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I really like that quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please welcome them both.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll start with you, Ben.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell us a little bit more about
yourself and a little bit about KanaTrade?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for the invitation,
Alex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Ben from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the business since 2004.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started then as an activist.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2008, I became the CEO of KanaTrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the oldest still existing hemp fair
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, we do a lot of cannabis
events in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the KanaTrade, the trade show,
we do the KanaSwiss Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Switzerland's Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a joint role contest for attract the
crowd at our events.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do Cannabis Village.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a special show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We visit all the big Swiss public fairs
and bring the topic cannabis to the normal
[SPEAKER_01]: people like my mom and my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And KanaTrade is the oldest cannabis expo
in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the story behind that?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 90s, it was not illegal to grow
weed in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just illegal to consume it as a
narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had hemp pillows, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the aroma bags called the
Dufzeckli.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably somebody of you remember that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could smoke in the trains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could smoke everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had more weed stores in Basel than
bakeries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really a crazy time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that time, KanaTrade was the third
hemp fair in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the high life in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis business in Germany,
both of them are no more available on the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So KanaTrade is the oldest still existing
hemp fair in Europe, maybe in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to come back to some of
those elements because we're talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: how different jurisdictions sort of play
on each other and how something that
[SPEAKER_04]: happens in one can affect what happens in
the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Immanuel, tell us a little bit about
yourself and Empalico in Soviet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, my nickname is Emy.
[SPEAKER_02]: My long name is Immanuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing business in cannabis for now 20
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very proud that I can say we are
one of the oldest clients of KanaTrade,
[SPEAKER_02]: of Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made the high times the nice times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the not that nice years together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last 20 years on the European,
on the German market, a lot happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started with magazines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have like the biggest magazine on
the German market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cost-free magazine and distributed
through grow shops and head shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the time, we tried a lot of
projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel very activistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are coming from the activist scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through the times we tried many,
many projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this moment we are a network of
seven companies across whole Europe doing
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually Empalico, which is in this
moment the most active company,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say, is dealing with CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made three years ago a decision not to
take part in the bidding to supply the
[SPEAKER_02]: German market with medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We decided to go the CBD way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to make it round, we are
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have really some aspects of history
which are really parallel and really
[SPEAKER_02]: similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one aspect, and this is very
interesting, to understand Europe,
[SPEAKER_02]: to understand we speaking sometimes even
the same language but having totally
[SPEAKER_02]: different system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Germany the consumption of cannabis
never has been forbidden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exact opposite of Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course the possession, buying and
selling was totally prohibited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why this combination with one
border made a lot million German people
[SPEAKER_02]: going to Switzerland when there was a very
nice time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again people are going to Switzerland
now to buy CBD grass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's an American connection there
as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were discussing this earlier probably
about 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: High Times did a story on a dual citizen
who is American and Swiss.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she had gone to Switzerland and found
out that they had never actually made it
[SPEAKER_04]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just kind of assumed it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nobody was doing anything with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she opened a hemp farm and would have
people come and visit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were also talking a little bit
about how California and what happened
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when San Francisco started licensing
dispensaries here, we were able to use
[SPEAKER_04]: that in Vancouver to get licenses there in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also when the border started closing down
a lot of BC Bud wasn't getting across the
[SPEAKER_04]: border anymore which sort of spiked
Washington, California and Oregon to go
[SPEAKER_04]: even to step up production.
[SPEAKER_04]: And something similar happened when
Switzerland kind of cracked down which we
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't quite get to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was a middle phase where
Switzerland was doing all of the stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: that Ben mentioned and then it sort of
stopped.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it stopped it started kind of
encouraging more Germans to kind of start
[SPEAKER_04]: growing for themselves as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there anything else you wanted to kind
of say about that time period and how that
[SPEAKER_04]: how your two countries are sort of how
they affect each other?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well to be honest the first one has been
the Dutch for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the first show and because they
are good neighbors they shared what they
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of Germans, a lot of Swiss people
love to go to Amsterdam and to enjoy the
[SPEAKER_02]: nice circumstances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why and it's it's also a matter
of the hippies coming back from Goa,
[SPEAKER_02]: from India and apart came back to
California, apart came back first to
[SPEAKER_02]: London then to Amsterdam and then from
there to Germany and to Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the history and yeah sadly the
Dutch fair don't happen anymore and also
[SPEAKER_02]: sadly the older German fair also don't
happen anymore but this makes the kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: trade really the oldest fair at least as I
know also on this planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't know any other fair which
I think it's now the 18th edition isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe hempfest in Seattle has you
beat by maybe one or two years in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: world stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about the earlier hemp scene
in the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Seattle hempfest is sort of a unique
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other festivals haven't quite had the same
sort of pedigree and holding together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Germany started medical cannabis
program a little while ago and then sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of sputtered on it and then started buying
cannabis from Canada instead.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now there are tenders that have been
accepted by the government but nobody's
[SPEAKER_04]: been told yet who they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk a little bit about that and
the impact that's having on patients and
[SPEAKER_04]: the medical market in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: One day Hollywood will make a really
interesting movie about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two years ago the German Parliament voted
for the patients to supply them from
[SPEAKER_02]: German cannabis from companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two years later there is still no German
cannabis available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year we imported exact 26.9 tons from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly 98% something like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the happy Canadians.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very happy for the Canadians.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have full legalization meanwhile but
it meant for the German patient again
[SPEAKER_02]: there was no cannabis on the German
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was really exceptional war.
[SPEAKER_02]: The German Parliament voted and first time
after Second World War the full Parliament
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% of all parliamentarians voted for one
law and two years later we see this law
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't really help the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these days the responsible
governmental office declared the tender
[SPEAKER_02]: which was given is now finished and the
companies which win the tender will be
[SPEAKER_02]: provided as proclaimed in the next days or
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you compare what has been tendered
it's about 2.6 tons per year which is
[SPEAKER_02]: given in certain different pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could happen you will win a tender
for producing 200 kilograms of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers each year.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is nothing especially when you see
already the consumption numbers and the
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription numbers when you see the
consumption already last year was on the
[SPEAKER_02]: level of nearly 27 tons and the tender is
about 2.6 tons.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see excellent possibilities for all
licensed producers which fit the GMP level
[SPEAKER_02]: and the country has an agency for cannabis
installed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking part and please send more
cannabis to Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I cannot tell anything else it's a
huge opportunity for everybody because the
[SPEAKER_02]: market just started and we are now at a
level of 40,000 patients with real
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription about 2 thirds of those
people are getting re founded by the
[SPEAKER_02]: health care and the diamond dimension it
could happen we will have 4 million
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can upscale yourself and imagine
the fantasies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah well and it's a good thing there's
tenders offered finally because you know
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to be getting a lot more
cannabis from Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we started with our recreational
market patients started finding it very
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult to access medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of us in B.C.
[SPEAKER_04]: that are used to a different sort of level
of cannabis West Coast cannabis aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: very happy with what the legal product
looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when we hear that it's going to
patients in other countries it actually
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't make us feel very good because we
don't really want that's not the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: we would choose to send.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know thankfully there's some movement
on the CBD side.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know we were talking also about how
this twists into some people seem to think
[SPEAKER_04]: that THC is harmful and CBD is beneficial.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's as Matt last panel mentioned
there's a lot of education that needs to
[SPEAKER_04]: be done about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least there's for some conditions
for some people they can access CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Switzerland's had a bit of a resurgence
not quite like it was in the old days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2011 nobody knows why but the Swiss
government changed the law of producing
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually in Europe and as well in
Switzerland it was allowed to grow up to
[SPEAKER_01]: zero point two or zero point three percent
of THC and Switzerland changed that to one
[SPEAKER_01]: percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of THC and then it needs some years up to
2016 where the first company get the
[SPEAKER_01]: license to sell it officially as a tobacco
substitute wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now two and a half years later we have
more than 500 registered companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy wheat in every supermarket at
every gas station at the highway
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere you can buy wheat as a tobacco
substitute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And across that people started fast to
produce CBD oil CBD extracts and as you
[SPEAKER_01]: may may better know than me with the plant
up to one percent THC you can grow up to
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 30 percent of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually we are a strong player on the
worldwide CBD market because of that even
[SPEAKER_01]: if Switzerland is a high in production
high in paying everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are now a partner and as well it
feels like it's the food in the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now many many companies big
companies with big indoor producing
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities factories.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are ready for the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone is just waiting for it and to buy
side a lot of money in the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah and I mean that's that's its own kind
of crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know when we legalized in Canada we
actually changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had legal hemp farming for quite
a long time but they weren't allowed to
[SPEAKER_04]: actually do anything with the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could grow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could take the fiber out of it but
they weren't allowed to actually extract
[SPEAKER_04]: anything from it at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're going to be allowed to extract
things and sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was good news for hemp producers and
we're going to start seeing CBD in natural
[SPEAKER_04]: health care products and cosmetics and
topicals and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we already as soon as that was
announced the market was flooded with 100
[SPEAKER_04]: percent legal CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see the same thing happening in a lot
of American markets where it's like oh no
[SPEAKER_04]: no CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's totally legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the situation?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean Switzerland is obviously kind of
unique and kind of leading the pack in
[SPEAKER_04]: that front.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the situation with CBD in Germany?
[SPEAKER_02]: So sadly the CBD flowers themselves are
forbidden but about all other products
[SPEAKER_02]: they are legal and it looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're happy a lot of our customers are
real pharmacies and proving the legal
[SPEAKER_02]: market and the legal aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge market and just in this moment
the big retailer chains are coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know 11.7 in Germany it's called Rewe
Kaufland Chibo and they are now asking for
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD product.
[SPEAKER_02]: What of course means a total different
target groups which we with our
[SPEAKER_02]: possibilities we never would have reached
or we would have need another 20 years to
[SPEAKER_02]: tell everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah and we were also talking about
different concentrates and things like
[SPEAKER_04]: that and so for myself I you know I'm
based in BC now but I grew up in Eastern
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada and in Eastern Canada there was a
lot of ties to Lebanon and Morocco and we
[SPEAKER_04]: smoked hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we smoked and that's all we
got for a very long time until I moved to
[SPEAKER_04]: BC basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany and Switzerland what are the hash
markets like?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the concentrate markets like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it sophisticated at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it not something people are really
interested in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ben we'll start with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are and it's strange and we are
allowed to grow the weed up to 1% THC but
[SPEAKER_01]: we are not allowed to make hash with it
because there is still one sentence in the
[SPEAKER_01]: law who says hash is forbidden at all like
a hard drug stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's quite a nice hash available
everywhere over Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are close to Morocco and as well the
ways from Nepal and Lebanon it's coming to
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland but we are not allowed to
produce it by ourselves right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Germany there is of course also a gray
market for extract distillates and the
[SPEAKER_02]: situation especially for CBD hash is
looking a little bit better than CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still my lawyer says better don't try
because it might provocate the prosecutor
[SPEAKER_02]: to visit you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes some things might be legal but still
you have to find a compromise with your
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbors and with the society around you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if everything concerning CBD is legal
might be they will find something in
[SPEAKER_02]: accountancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of shops I have seen broken did not
broke because of the legal laws about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis but because of the very normal
business reasons cash flow management
[SPEAKER_02]: liquidity scale up employees and things
like this and not because the prosecutor
[SPEAKER_02]: came but better not to provocate the
police.
[SPEAKER_02]: So still there is a market but I don't
believe it will become that big like in
[SPEAKER_02]: the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in the dispensary and the guy told
me 50% of what we are selling is something
[SPEAKER_02]: to vaporize and not the flower and I don't
believe this market will be that big in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe but might be just a question of
generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I mean we've seen the same thing in
Canada too and legally you can get hash if
[SPEAKER_04]: you make it yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're technically allowed to do that but
that's literally the only way you can do
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: For a little while somebody had sort of
they sort of tricked Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of said you know oh no this this
Keith is just dried cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all it is and so they were actually
allowed to sell it but I think it only
[SPEAKER_04]: lasted like a week or so and then Health
Canada went wait wait a minute and then
[SPEAKER_04]: stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: This I have I have to tell this story
because nobody believes but it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany of course also regulated this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if your doctor tells not to smoke the
or vaporize the pure the CBD the flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: THC flowers he can write on the
prescription that the pharmacologist will
[SPEAKER_02]: prepare it for your consumption so he can
make out hash of it or distillate and yes
[SPEAKER_02]: he gets paid for making you like the
doctor told you have to inhale it or to
[SPEAKER_02]: eat it or whatever and this is a crazy
thing so if you really want good hash then
[SPEAKER_02]: persuade your doctor that you need you
prefer to to consume hash than flowers and
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah and might be even the house insurance
will pay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well and you know I think one of the
things that's really interesting too I
[SPEAKER_04]: mean kind of talking about hash and this
is a you know Switzerland you chose CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: joints to replace smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever I go to Europe I can't I can't
really take a joint from people as it's
[SPEAKER_04]: passing around the circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: No thanks you know unless I know the
person is Canadian or American because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's all mixed with tobacco which is
something that you know that was one of
[SPEAKER_04]: the reasons why we like when we don't have
to smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like hash in Canada a lot but you know
most of us I think prefer just the flower
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly because we never mix it with
any tobacco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see that sort of custom changing or
is that just like super ingrained into the
[SPEAKER_04]: way that people smoke cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now it's a most people smoke with
tobacco for sure but with the CBD you are
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed as well now to sell CBD joints so
people start to smoke it pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: People start to vape and if I have a look
to the United States and probably to
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada as well all the vape thing depends
everything like that I think it will come
[SPEAKER_01]: over Europe as well and Swiss people and
Europe people will start to smoke vape
[SPEAKER_01]: pens as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I think so too I mean I do have a
concern about that when it comes to
[SPEAKER_04]: medical patients for example because
vaping there's certain compounds that it
[SPEAKER_04]: just it won't get and the concern is not
actually the vaping it's the idea that oh
[SPEAKER_04]: vaping is okay and anything else is not
okay and that's not really what we've seen
[SPEAKER_04]: and again in particular for certain
conditions you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again in Canada you know most of until we
had legalization come in which is not
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily as nice as it sounds until we
had that point the government was fighting
[SPEAKER_04]: every step of the ways and no you can't
grow more than one plant okay no you can't
[SPEAKER_04]: grow more than two plant okay you can't
grow more than three and this was like
[SPEAKER_04]: years of court cases in between.
[SPEAKER_04]: We won the right for medical patients to
have access to edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: When Health Canada finally allowed it it
was just an oil that's capped at such a
[SPEAKER_04]: low point that it's almost not even a
concentrate anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you do you see regulation in Europe
being maybe a little bit more sensible
[SPEAKER_04]: than that or how much is Canada's
regulations and approach influencing what
[SPEAKER_04]: what German and Swiss and other European
governments are doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a lot because I think we will
never or I can't imagine that we will be
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to sell THC gum beers green and
red and blue in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so as I know my country and
my government so I think it will be
[SPEAKER_01]: strictly regulated with especially with
edibles and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah so our proposed edible rules came out
and it's 10 milligrams per package which
[SPEAKER_04]: is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit of a cultural question.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was young I traveled to Amsterdam
and I learned a lot about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: To smoke it with tobacco sadly sadly but
that's typical European way and it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: changing it's changing because more
cannabis is accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can afford to have a own joint this
was like one yeah you don't share anymore
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody has one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing I've noticed about Berlin
is everybody has their own joint where
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe in the States or Canada you stand in
a circle pass around Berlin everybody has
[SPEAKER_03]: their own blend like minus 75 percent
tobacco and 25 percent hash and this is
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly and then we learned also in
Amsterdam that cookies and and pralines
[SPEAKER_02]: space cake it's a hard drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy it somewhere but don't use it
too often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better with somebody who is experienced.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some there is also some demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have also some friends which have on
the prescription 30 or 40 grams per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: How to consume without using edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to cook with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to eat it and no other way.
Suppositories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Suppositories.
[SPEAKER_03]: No no I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very effective medicinal treatment
for a lot of people and it doesn't get you
[SPEAKER_03]: as high on the THC because it doesn't
necessarily go through the liver just 30
[SPEAKER_04]: grams a day though is a lot of
suppositories.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also if you're crossing the border.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah that could be useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have always regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a nice formula for crossing all
the borders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go also to Switzerland with my
German cannabis and but many people try to
[SPEAKER_02]: to put it into the normal diet and for
other people it is it could be really
[SPEAKER_02]: dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: This this doses of course we have to learn
because we what we learn is or what our
[SPEAKER_02]: politician could learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you when you have legalized you are
just starting to legalize.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're coming to a certain point and then
you see a new question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each society has to solve it for its
own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are learning from from Canada and
also from California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the other side we have our own
system and we have to make our neighbors
[SPEAKER_02]: happy as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think we're gonna have time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got time for one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I had one more for them actually in
terms of Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's who's next.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean if we've got time to monitor man
I'm just chilling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so Canada is the first G7 country to
legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uruguay was the first country in the
Americas to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So who's going to be first in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably Luxembourg.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made an announcement to the
government of Luxembourg that they will
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize medical and recreational but when
it will happen we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually you can play bingo with Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see good chances for Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now two important things on the
way in our government.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the easy way for medical use and
the other one is like a pilot project to
[SPEAKER_01]: get your weed in a drugstore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both projects are on the way to come in
the next one two three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah I hope for Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope also of course for Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope for Switzerland as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be in Zurich in May.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The International Cannabis Business
Conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: One quick question then we got to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben my mom's Swiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's from Zurich.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland's always been very progressive
with addressing the drug problem and
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is questions for Germany as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are both countries are your countries
using that as an alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: To sell the market cannabis as an
alternative to the opioids as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin and addressing it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need the right doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this moment we still have a big lack of
doctors which prescribing and dare to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have might be two dozens for Germany
and you need one doctor who overtakes the
[SPEAKER_02]: responsibility and start doing exactly
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And singular singular cases are known but
I don't know any doctor who is specialized
[SPEAKER_02]: on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Canada we do have a lot of doctors that
special specialize in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately our regulators are going the
opposite direction and making it very
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Particularly Vancouver one of the reasons
why they legalized dispensaries before it
[SPEAKER_04]: was legal in Canada was specifically
because of the very serious opiate problem
[SPEAKER_04]: that B.C.
[SPEAKER_04]: is facing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been the opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've made it harder for people to access.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've you know our provincial governments
are now spending a lot of money on
[SPEAKER_04]: education campaigns around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still not saying a word about opiates.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know they're still shoveling those
down people's throats.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's it's we went the opposite way of
the way we should have gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we see that a little bit here in
California as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the Bay Area when it when
Berkeley and San Francisco started regular
[SPEAKER_04]: regulating their own dispensaries they
cared about the health service the health
[SPEAKER_04]: component of it and who was actually
getting access to it and whether it was
[SPEAKER_04]: covered and subsidized a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as soon as you start having the
state regulate it that kind of goes by the
[SPEAKER_04]: wayside.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you have the federal
government regulate it more will go by the
[SPEAKER_04]: wayside in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it unfortunately seems to be the
pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the only kind of hope is that once
it's legal we can get research done on it
[SPEAKER_04]: that makes it harder and harder to stop to
stop those things from happening and stop
[SPEAKER_04]: those types of programs from being put in
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it again for our panelists.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was very enlightening and fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
