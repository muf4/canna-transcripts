[SPEAKER_01]: So you got an attorney and then you got an
economist.
[SPEAKER_01]: My God.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so my name is Beau Whitney.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk today about kind of the
economics of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to give a broad overview
about what's going on in the market
[SPEAKER_01]: globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are always talking about the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and then narrow it down to Europe and then
Germany in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a little bit about Whitney Economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a global data and research firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have clients all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're based out of Portland, Oregon in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Bob mentioned, there's this growing
expanse of countries that are legalizing
[SPEAKER_01]: either hemp or adult use or medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: The list is just growing day to day.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot to keep up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the key message here is that even
excluding hemp, you've got a large market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a large number of consumers in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the U.S., so what my firm
does is we gather data on all these
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at trends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We look at ramping scenarios from country
to country, state to state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put out projections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our projection for 2022 is about
$29 billion in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's growing up to about 81,
82 billion by 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: By 2030.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, this whole COVID surge in
demand is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of working from home,
or as I called it, working from stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were able to consume more and
more because they did have to go to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they could work while under the
influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that surge is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these, the pattern, the growth
rates and all this, in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: are going back to the growth rates that we
saw in 2019 pre-COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of normalizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the growth really is in the market
is in these new emerging states,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as New York, New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more mature markets like Oregon,
Washington, Colorado, they've peaked.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're now just basically steady.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the growth is based upon
population growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so new markets are coming online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the growth is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the opportunities are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now not every state has the same
opportunities, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now there's this talk about will
inflation in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: will that impact demand?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not really seeing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing more deflation in products
that are going to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we see inflation's impact on the
market is in the startups.
[SPEAKER_01]: So deflation, product pricing,
softening of demand due to COVID returns.
[SPEAKER_01]: But inflation, 25% to 40% inflation for
construction, for breaking out new
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries and that like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will have an impact on new markets
like New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
[SPEAKER_01]: like just how much of an impact,
not quite sure yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's definitely a present,
something to be considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, we've built these models.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the total market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang on just a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for indulging me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The total addressable market in Europe is
right around $63 billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's illicit and legal combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the countries are starting to
reform, or they want to reform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're really looking at Germany to
be their guide throughout this whole
[SPEAKER_01]: reform process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the reform throughout Europe
is inevitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, who will supply to these reforming
countries?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, our models indicate that the
countries that are on the outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fringes of Europe will be the low cost
suppliers into the European Union once
[SPEAKER_01]: things become regionalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, every country seemingly wants
to supply into Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got Asia, you've got South
America, you've got Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's only so much market to go
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're contemplating supplying
into Europe, be very, very careful about
[SPEAKER_01]: oversupply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's not a whole lot of data about
the European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's more and more insistence by
regulators, by member states and member
[SPEAKER_01]: countries to start gathering data so that
we can do a better job of predicting
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so data is a key issue throughout
every market seemingly in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five countries make up about 62% of the
total demand in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've listed the five countries here,
Italy, France, Germany, UK, and Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these usage rates and this total
market is rather under-reported because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's this lack of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, my firm is estimating that
there's about 37 million consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: 22 million is being reported by the United
Nations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be as high as 150 million if
you include a lot of these periphery
[SPEAKER_01]: European countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty substantial market is the second
largest market for revenue purpose right
[SPEAKER_01]: now in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, Asia and Africa have the most
consumers in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to make that
distinction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to give a little bit of time on
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: The post-legalization ramp will capture a
greater percentage of the legal demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll capture more of the demand in
Germany than in the US, but less in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is that by mapping
out these ramps and seeing how the
[SPEAKER_01]: structures are evolving and the like,
the demand is rather predictable and the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversion from the illicit market
consumer to legal market consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you look at it just from a first
year, second year, third year,
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany should do a better job of
capturing the legal consumer than the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Canada was really off to the races.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they did a reasonable job even
though they're kind of peaking and
[SPEAKER_01]: stalling right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ultimately, where it goes in
terms of Germany and how much legal
[SPEAKER_01]: capture, how much consumer demand,
it will be supported by the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will really depend upon the rollout
of the regulatory structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's still in a state of flux.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, by 2030, there should be
about $5.4 billion in legal sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: $2 billion or $2.1 billion by 2025.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this incorporates the delay in the
rollout, the 2024 start.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're predicting that it's going to falter
a little bit out of the gate in 2024 and
[SPEAKER_01]: then really take off by 2025.
[SPEAKER_01]: But $5.4 billion, it's a pretty sizable
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not even including some of the
demand that's going to come in from Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: Tourism.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the key to a successful ramp is based
upon access.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more people, the more access they have
in stores and retail outlets and the like,
[SPEAKER_01]: the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's easier for consumers to
participate if they can go down the street
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than drive 25 kilometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And price, price plays a real important
role in the amount of capture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the consumer feels as though
they're paying too much of a premium
[SPEAKER_01]: relative to the listed market,
then they just won't participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the level of participation will slow
down dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to take a while to ramp in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then eventually, they'll gain some
traction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my firm not only looks at the ramps and
that's demand, looks at jobs, looks at
[SPEAKER_01]: taxes, but we also have models on supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the often overlooked
parts of regulatory deployments is sizing
[SPEAKER_01]: the supply appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been mentioned multiple times today
that the supply is actually too little
[SPEAKER_01]: even to support the medical market,
let alone the adult use market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But based upon the total addressable
market that's elicit and legal,
[SPEAKER_01]: the total supply that's required is about
950,000 kilos.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hundreds of metric tons versus the
10 to 25 that are in place right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as it comes to regulatory deployments,
it's really critical to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_01]: country stays ahead of the supply so that
it doesn't constrain the market
[SPEAKER_01]: unnecessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you undersupply, it can really
harm the market by keeping prices too high
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's supply and demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you oversupply, prices crash and then
it doesn't help anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tax revenues are suboptimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The profitability of companies are
suboptimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really important to strike
that balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, my models can predict at any given
stage how much supply you need to support
[SPEAKER_01]: the demand and support the ramp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't need to supply all of this
supply immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to just grow as the market grows,
evolve as the market evolves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't think there's ever been
projections and requirements presented on
[SPEAKER_01]: the German market, especially going out to
2025, 2030.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is some revolutionary data right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to be refining this as
we get more and more data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So key considerations for German
regulatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Access and price is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stress that enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And collecting and publishing data is also
very, very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often, regulators don't know much about
their market because they don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the data is behind firewalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's tough to make good business
decisions because you don't have the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more data that can be provided to
the market, the better because it helps
[SPEAKER_01]: shape policy, helps shape business
decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important to remain flexible from
a regulatory perspective because there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of unknowns as these deployments take
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so understanding what you know and
what you don't know is really critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being flexible enough to say,
OK, this isn't working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Bob mentioned about the regulatory
that you can change things quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what will happen in the
German market for a period of four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: years after the initial rollout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned the importance of gradual
supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the model where Germany
allowed for imports, they had some basic
[SPEAKER_01]: domestic supply and then supplemented that
with imports, I think that's a good model.
[SPEAKER_01]: There just needs to be a better balance
between domestic production and imports.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind that, for regulators,
that there's an emboldened Melissa market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're already ahead of the game
relative to what's going on in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory deployment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for those that are in the industry,
education and communication are really
[SPEAKER_01]: key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Constant communications with regulators is
helpful for them because they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: regulate this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've never been doing it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have done it on a small scale
with medical, but adult use is a different
[SPEAKER_01]: piece, to say the least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a business operator, set realistic
expectations with your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't think that you're going to get 10%
of the market or 20% of the market when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's more realistic to only say get two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And know your cost structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob and others mentioned how there's going
to be price declines as the market
[SPEAKER_01]: retours, becomes more saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing this in every market.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're also seeing is a high level of
business failures in markets where they
[SPEAKER_01]: get overextended and their cost structure
is turned upside down relative to the
[SPEAKER_01]: market price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really important to understand
the cost structure understand where the
[SPEAKER_01]: price is and where it's going and make
informed decisions on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And know where, when, and where you have
to get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't support your business because
prices have declined so much, then it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important to know that too and to make
that tough decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's important also to act local.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a local issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is generally a very emotional
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to act local, but it's also
important to think globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, five cents a gram in Thailand,
I've seen instances where it's a penny a
[SPEAKER_01]: gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen wholesale prices in South
America at a penny a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the United States, production costs are
25, 50 cents a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this competitive disadvantage
in the United States and it could be very
[SPEAKER_01]: well in Germany as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to understand the role
of competition on a global scale when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're operating locally and just be
cognizant of that so that you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked a little bit about hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I presented some of this data before on
the hemp side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp is a pretty amazing industry in and
of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually larger by our
calculations than the global cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this example up here, there's the
global demand total addressable market
[SPEAKER_01]: around $250 billion for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just in 10 product categories,
taking minimal market share for hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a $350 billion market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just, those are reasonable
assumptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's already a presence in automotive.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's already a presence in plastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's already a presence in animal feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these industries are expected to grow
exponentially over the next decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in some countries, hemp is
viewed as a competitor to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I see it more as a partner or
compliment to higher-tech cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when it comes to the ESG
side of things, environmental,
[SPEAKER_01]: social, and governance.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the environmental side, cannabis is a
real dirty industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of plastics,
a lot of energy consumption and life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so hemp can help compliment and
support the higher-tech cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: by providing environmentally friendly
products to help bring those products to
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plastics is one fine example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's all sorts of demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to belabor the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's big industries in hemp,
and it's a compliment to higher-tech
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of predictions, Germany is one
of the first major markets out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: gates here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it expects additional acceleration of
legalization throughout the EU and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for a spike.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned this about cannabis tourism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a novel industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a novelty to go to Germany to buy
adult news.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually, that will decline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will go away as more and more
countries deploy their legal systems as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And prices will remain high at the start,
mainly driven by lack of access and under
[SPEAKER_01]: supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: But prices will eventually normalize and
decline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the normalization, I think,
is something that people really need to
[SPEAKER_01]: build into their business models.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the key message here is it's an
exciting opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But businesses need to be disciplined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulators need to be disciplined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there needs to be an understanding not
only of the demand, but the supply as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, and plan accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not an easy nut to crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very difficult process to go
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually, there's plenty of
opportunity for successes, not only in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, but throughout the EU and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to say thank you for this
opportunity to speak today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some data here for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're happy to share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll take any questions if there are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Paul Whitney.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone's got to have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you think Bayern Munich is going to
do this year?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one upstairs.
All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Misha, who has to climb
all the stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you're talking about the potential
markets, what is the reason that Italy,
[SPEAKER_00]: with less people, does have such more
potential than, for example, France or
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the question is, why is Italy so
much larger than some of the more
[SPEAKER_01]: populated countries?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes down to usage rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So based upon the UN numbers and others,
there's a higher percentage rate than
[SPEAKER_01]: there's more and more consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what drives the larger
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing to note is that these are
pretty conservative numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come from the UN.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come from the EU through some of the
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that they're under-reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that this would be a good
baseline to go by.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the market is actually substantially
larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the demand and consumption patterns
are uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: From not only state to state, but
continent to continent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm seeing this especially out of some
recently published data out of Uruguay,
[SPEAKER_01]: where 31% of adults have used cannabis in
the past year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is well in excess of what's
being reported by the UN.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, like I said, the amount of
consumption, the amount of supply here is
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very conservative relative to
actually what's going on in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: With what experience we have to learn from
other countries, what is one hope that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have for Germany to improve the process
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, what is the one hope
that Germany has that would spell success
[SPEAKER_01]: in the deployment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what do you think Germans can do
better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think they've done a reasonable
job in terms of deploying their medical
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have the opportunity now to build
the infrastructure from the supply all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most countries build their models and
their regulatory structures on the top
[SPEAKER_01]: down, the retail and the taxes and all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they go, oh yeah, now we need to
supply the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Germany sets up the market to
where they are cognizant of the supply and
[SPEAKER_01]: prepare the supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that takes the longest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then from there, they'll set themselves up
for success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can maximize revenues.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can support the businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even talk about job creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that it all starts with the
plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
