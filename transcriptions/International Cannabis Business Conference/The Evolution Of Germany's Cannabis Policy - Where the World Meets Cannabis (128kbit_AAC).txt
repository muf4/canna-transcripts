[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that we will have an increase in
prescriptions from physicians for patients
[SPEAKER_01]: who want to use medical cannabis for the
treatment of their disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to ask those licensees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you making money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you making money?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the cultivation of cannabis at home,
you can actually get your seeds from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis associations, from the
cultivation associations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're not a member, you should
actually be able to get your seeds from
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the cultivation association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
ICBC, where the world meets cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very excited to be here in our
studio in Ljubljana with an extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: special guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a partner at Denton's law firm,
and he is located in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is actually heading the European
Cannabis Group for Denton's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's probably no more knowledgeable
person in Germany or the rest of Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: than our very esteemed guest, Peter
Holmberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex, thank you very much for the kind
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known each other for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've kind of seen the whole story of
cannabis in Germany unfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to get to that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing I'm really curious about is
Denton's, is it one of the largest law
[SPEAKER_00]: firms in the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very esteemed international law
firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how can you tell us a little bit
about how you became the head of the
[SPEAKER_00]: European Cannabis Group for Denton's,
how that unfolded?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denton's is one of the largest law firms
worldwide, with a great number of
[SPEAKER_01]: different offices in various jurisdictions
in Europe, in North America, South
[SPEAKER_01]: America, as well as in Asia, not to forget
Middle East and Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think since two weeks also in the
Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a law firm who has joined our network
in Malila.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually happened back in 2016,
so some time ago, when Germany was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually on the edge to legalize cannabis
for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, and we can come back to that in
a minute, a very interesting judgment of
[SPEAKER_01]: the highest administrative court in
Germany, the so-called
[SPEAKER_01]: Bundesverwaltungsgericht, who at that
point in time allowed patients who at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point in time had only a special permit
from the Bay Farm to use cannabis for the
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment of their disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the patients actually wanted to
grow at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he actually informed the Bay Farm,
which is the German FDA, that following
[SPEAKER_01]: the permit to use cannabis for the
treatment of his disease, and there were
[SPEAKER_01]: only 600 to 700 patients at that point in
time, he wants to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to grow at his house?
[SPEAKER_01]: At home, for various reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he said, if I'm allowed to use it
for the treatment of my disease,
[SPEAKER_01]: why can't I grow it at home?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Germans are very good in sending
cease and desist orders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what the Bay Farm did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he went to court through all the
instances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the last instance, before the
highest administrative court in Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: he actually won, with giving him the
allowance, the permission actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow cannabis for his treatment at
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So setting a precedent, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, at that point in time,
for the legislator, for the government,
[SPEAKER_01]: a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: 600 growers of cannabis in Germany allowed
by the highest administrative court.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they did, they very quickly
reacted to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2017, in March 2017, they legalized
cannabis for the treatment of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: side, for the treatment of various
diseases, upon prescription from
[SPEAKER_01]: physicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, also then, with the goal to
disallow the respective home grow at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The irony abounds, but go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's seven years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually, at that point in
time, they are looking for cultivators in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happened, but at that point in
time was, immediately in March 2017,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a need for various patients who
got the prescription from the physicians
[SPEAKER_01]: to get cannabis products, mainly flowers
at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, there were importers
and, of course, cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know, Canada and the US,
but in particular, Canada, we are years
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead of Germany in that respect,
at that point in time, back in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a cannabis practice,
and we still have a cannabis practice,
[SPEAKER_01]: in Canada, at Dentons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, there was a great
interest in the German market by,
[SPEAKER_01]: in particular, the Canadian cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember it well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back in April 2017, just one month
later, the first cultivators wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: enter the German market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can name them because it's public
domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Canopy Growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we advised them how they could enter
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They acquired a company, which was called
MedCan at that point in time, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: their actually distributor for the small
amounts of THC-rated products,
[SPEAKER_01]: of flowers, for the small group of
patients in the German market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of a sudden, it exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question was, who can handle that
in Germany for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who has the knowledge?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm heading also the life sciences
practice in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm advising life sciences companies,
which means companies in the fields of
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, medical
devices, and biotechnology already for
[SPEAKER_01]: over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was myself in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a natural fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a natural fit that cannabis for
medical purposes, is then handled by me
[SPEAKER_01]: and my team from the Berlin office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you vie for this position,
I'm curious?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it appointed upon you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or were you interested in?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was really interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we were following the court
decision and the development of that court
[SPEAKER_01]: decision at the highest administrative
court in Germany closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there was something on the edge,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interestingly, and as such,
we deeply dived into the new legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a new law, which was the
Cannabis Act for medical purposes,
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to advise our clients
accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, we are very much looking
forward to each and every regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I remember I met you in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had been in the industry for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really impressed with what you
were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was impressed how you were doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just thought it was kind of cool
that, hey, Denton's has a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: division in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we take it seven years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the big elephant in the room
these days is that Germany is close to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing, decriminalizing, modernizing
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we hear a lot about what's going to
happen in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hear about phase one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear about phase two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear some other interesting things
about seeds and corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear things about medical cannabis
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you give us a quick overview,
Peter, of what the heck is going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know a lot of people are really
excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much time do we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can speak about it for the next two
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how about the cursory overview?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I think the milestone was,
of course, back in 2017, the legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was really the milestone in
triggering the following events,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was then the new government,
which was elected, actually introduced the
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization for recreational cannabis,
the Ample Coalition, which is the Social
[SPEAKER_01]: Democrats, the Free Democrats,
and the Green Party.
[SPEAKER_01]: They introduced that into their coalition
agreement, with two sentences only.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis for recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they actually started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then months, really nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they then actually did,
they tried to find a way, how can we do
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is a very strict legal
framework, as we all know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are the three different UN
conventions, the most important one,
[SPEAKER_01]: the 1961 UN Single Convention,
of which Germany is also a member,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not only Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also the European Union, which is a
member.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such, the restrictions for the
legalization of recreational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only cannabis, but for any kind of
narcotics, and cannabis is, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: respectively defined as such, is
prohibited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is actually what the German
government took into consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they put that into their coalition
agreement, nobody thought about the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: hurdles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, there were more than
one legal hurdle, not only the UN
[SPEAKER_01]: conventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know, for example, Canada,
back in 2019, legalized cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational purposes, not really taking
much care about the UN conventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, Germany is a member of the
European Union, as we all know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such, they have to adhere to the
respective, also European regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means, in particular, the Schengen
Agreement, which is the basis for the
[SPEAKER_01]: European Union, and of course,
all the protocols following out of this
[SPEAKER_01]: Schengen Agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in October, 2022, the German
government presented a legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nicely, I would say, drafted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to cultivate cannabis for
recreational purposes in Germany under the
[SPEAKER_01]: government control.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to distribute this cannabis
for recreational purposes via license
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries, license means also under
government control, in order to legalize
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis for recreational purposes in
Germany, to the full extent as we actually
[SPEAKER_01]: have seen that in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew that there are legal hurdles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they went to the European Commission
and asked, can we actually do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did they ask?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it would have moved forward,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the European Commission,
as well as all other European member
[SPEAKER_01]: states, could initiate respective legal
actions before the European Court of
[SPEAKER_01]: Justice for the breach of the Schengen
Agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just so the audience understands what
this means, basically you're saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: the EU is basically acting as a
centralized federal authority that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: punitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take punitive measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's not the right legal word,
but they could sue the respective country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could withhold funds for other
things, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, punitive actions, I would say,
is the right expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could actually initiate, as I said,
respective legal proceedings before the
[SPEAKER_01]: European Court of Justice.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Germany had just recently lost,
again, I would say big thing before the
[SPEAKER_01]: European Court of Justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't want to risk that again,
which is, I think, understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was what they lose?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one was with regard to the toll
for private cars and their toll system,
[SPEAKER_01]: which they wanted to implement,
which was not in line with toll system in
[SPEAKER_01]: the road.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just for... No, we have it for trucks,
for all trucks, which are on the German
[SPEAKER_01]: Autobahn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have it for private cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other countries have it for private cars,
you know, like Austria or France.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all having... So we're
digressing, but I'm such a political
[SPEAKER_00]: science nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would that not be constitutionally
legal if it's or why would that be not OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they wanted to privilege the
German drivers, the German inhabitants,
[SPEAKER_01]: the German people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to reimburse them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of those plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think that because that was shot
down or they lost that decision,
[SPEAKER_00]: you think that was one of the reasons they
didn't... No, they actually were asking
[SPEAKER_01]: the European Commission, can we do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the European Commission said... And
our Minister of Health, Karl Lauterbach,
[SPEAKER_01]: said we had very productive talks with the
European Commission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that the euphemism of the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, you know,
this whole plan was in the bin,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, unfortunately, because I think
that would have been the best way to
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think that would have been the best
way to legalize it if you were the health
[SPEAKER_00]: minister of Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you have done it the Canadian way
and just have eschewed all advice from the
[SPEAKER_00]: higher ups, if you will?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very difficult question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me rephrase it so I don't put it on
you per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you think... What do you think
would have happened if Germany had just
[SPEAKER_00]: gone for it like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have been sued before the
European Court of Justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which would have put all the whole program
on hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like an injunction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can't proceed if you're really
sued and stopped by the European Court of
[SPEAKER_01]: Justice to initiate the respective law for
the legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you would ask me what would I have
done?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, of course, ways, from my point
of view, to at least use the...
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say loopholes, but the
possibilities in the UN conventions and in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Schengen Agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would probably have decided to do it
the same way as Switzerland, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: is doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we have scientifically controlled
pilot projects in various cities,
[SPEAKER_01]: in various regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order also to gain some data,
what kind of impact does it have,
[SPEAKER_01]: the legalization, on the community,
on the users?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then decide how we can actually go
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe lobby them with these generated
data, the proper legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is basically... And this phase
would be phase two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about phase one, but this is
more of a phase two thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what the European... As far as I
understand, legalization is okay under the
[SPEAKER_00]: auspices of health and research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are some of the things you're talking
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the convention?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: For medical purposes, you can,
of course, legalize cannabis, which
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany has done, which is totally in line
with the UN conventions and the respective
[SPEAKER_01]: Schengen Agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you then start a scientific
project... Scientific purposes is also
[SPEAKER_01]: possible under the UN conventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start a scientific project,
trying to understand what kind of impact
[SPEAKER_01]: the legalization of cannabis or
recreational purposes has, and then gain
[SPEAKER_01]: data from that, and then decide how you're
going to do it in the future, that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect legal way how you could do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still would have the control,
of course, with regard to the cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: with regard to the distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not each and every consumer would have
got access to the respective sources in
[SPEAKER_01]: these pilot projects, because you can't
roll that out nationwide or German-wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it or can establish it in
various cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, let's talk about Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have maybe 10, 15 different
dispensaries where actually consumers,
[SPEAKER_01]: registered consumers, could buy cannabis
for recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is then spread out in other
cities, maybe in other areas, other
[SPEAKER_01]: regions in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, you can actually gain
the respective data, which, you correctly
[SPEAKER_01]: said, is actually the second step of the
legalization model which Germany is now
[SPEAKER_01]: using.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would have been my favorite
solution, very much the same as
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland is doing it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I tend to agree with you,
Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a decrim guy for sure, but I think you
could decrim and still not have the social
[SPEAKER_00]: clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have just said, well,
we'll have possession.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow three plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty benign.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the social clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the social clubs phase, one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about everyone's beloved phase
one in Germany, which is controversial,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of different opinions on
phase one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my own take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very curious to hear your take on phase
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social clubs, Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you thinking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the facts first,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is phase one?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it all encompass?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in phase one, we have also two
different steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Step one is homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each and every adult can actually grow up
to three female plants at home and can use
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis cultivated from these plants
for his personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Per household, three?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or per person at the household?
[SPEAKER_01]: Per person at the household.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have three people at the
household, you have nine female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second step is what you said,
cannabis clubs, which is not really the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis club system which we know from
Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I would say, cultivation
associations where up to 500 members can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually grow cannabis in a community and
can then use the cannabis which is
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivated at the cultivation association
for their own personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can hire a surrogate or they can
choose a surrogate to grow for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we know?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know that yet by heart,
because the Cannabis Gesetz, the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Law, the Cannabis Act for legalizing the
recreational use of cannabis is not very
[SPEAKER_01]: precise on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's relatively silent how this structure
should function.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they leave it to the states within
Germany to really then establish the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: framework under which conditions the
cultivation associations can operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be, yes, you're right,
it could be, the assumption is right,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they actually can source that out,
that they can combine their need or their
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation possibilities and source that
out to a party who actually, the
[SPEAKER_01]: possibility to grow and has the knowledge
to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that this will
materialize, frankly speaking,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we'll see what the various states will
come out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the onus is put upon the locale or the
region or the bundesstaat of each
[SPEAKER_00]: bundesstaat can make up their own time,
place and manner rules or locales or
[SPEAKER_00]: municipalities?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say that you can foresee chaos,
but you can see a heterogeneous approach,
[SPEAKER_01]: because this federal law leaves it now to
the various states within Germany to
[SPEAKER_01]: really, in very much detail, define the
legal framework of how these cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: associations can operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can assume the regulations will be
more liberal in Berlin and more strict in
[SPEAKER_00]: Bayern, for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: The assumption is not out of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how that will really work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first of all, the law has to pass the
parliament.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has done so already in the first
reading, the second and third reading,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the normal way in order to
establish respective laws in lawmaking,
[SPEAKER_01]: will actually be planned for next week in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see what the outcome will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of right now, is that vote scheduled on
the, what do they call it, the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bundesordnung?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bundestag has an agenda, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have looked yesterday and it was not on
the agenda yet, but that doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be put on the agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's put on the various committees,
which have to look at the law as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, let's assume it would pass
second and third reading next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be re-transferred to the
Bundesrat, which is the council.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, it will be either passed
and then only be signed by the president
[SPEAKER_01]: for the implementation or actually
referred, which is possible, to a
[SPEAKER_01]: mediation committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the Bundesrat decides that there should
be additional amendments and changes in
[SPEAKER_00]: the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right now, most people are assuming
that when it gets to the Bundesrat,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to go through because it's not
politically expedient for anybody to
[SPEAKER_00]: oppose it because of how many greens are
in the local districts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a little bit that I've heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the greens could then stop it if SPD
wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little confused because I'm not an
expert on German politics by any means,
[SPEAKER_00]: but basically the opinion is that it will
pass out of the Bundesrat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bundesrat doesn't have a veto right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a law which the Bundespart has
the possibility to stop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they can actually ask for additional
amendments, which they have done already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because before it came to the parliament,
it was already being discussed within the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bundesrat, who actually said we would like
to have a number of amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: As such, then the law was being
re-transferred to the various ministries
[SPEAKER_01]: and everybody was working on various parts
of that law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the new amended draft bill looks a
little different in some respects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could, I wouldn't say grievance,
but they could say, well, we don't agree
[SPEAKER_00]: with this new little change, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have to look into some other
effects or some other parts of that draft
[SPEAKER_01]: law, which are interesting for,
in particular, the cannabis industry on
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what is happening as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in the draft laws that cannabis
and THC rated products will be taken out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the German narcotics industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get to that in just a second,
because I actually think that that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: most exciting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just finish up phase one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two phases of phase one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first phase is what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say the Bundestag passes it and then
it goes through the Bundesrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say around April 1st,
it becomes legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's becoming legal is three
plants you can grow now and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: possess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: 25, 50 grams?
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 grams if you are in the public and 50
grams if you're at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 grams if you're at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second phase of phase one
will go, will be like July.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying then they implement the
social, the social clause.
[SPEAKER_01]: These like association, cultivation
associations, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's, within this first step is that
the German Narcotics Act will be amended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now here I think is, I think this is
the elephant in the room, what we're about
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't think, this is what I don't
think a lot of people know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a little more esoteric when it
comes to the kanji law and something that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that the market driver in Germany
or in Europe right now is the German
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the real market lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's CBD stuff, but that's a
little ambiguous.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the German medical market,
you pretty much know, pretty much right
[SPEAKER_00]: where things stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is coming off the narcotics list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will this, if, if passes, will this be
part of a phase one, a phase one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will this happen like April if it,
assuming it goes through the Bundesrat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Peter, please tell us what does
cannabis coming off the narcotics list,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm getting like goosebumps just
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean for the medical
marijuana industry in Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have my crystal ball with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think that might mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely, or let's take a look into
the current prescription policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, a physician who wants to prescribe
cannabis to a patient is prescribing a
[SPEAKER_01]: narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, he needs to have a special
permission to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He needs to use actually special
prescription blocks in a different color
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to prescribe narcotic for
patients for the treatment of his disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is to a certain extent, a
psychological hurdle from my point of
[SPEAKER_01]: view.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just change that into an RX
product, which means it's just a product,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is being prescribed as, as any other
RX product.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, what would be an example of
another RX?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, any kind of heavy
painkillers, for example, who are not a
[SPEAKER_01]: narcotic, but who are under prescription.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something which is comparable
to that then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course a great number of different
pharmaceuticals, which has have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribed in order to get it from the
pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just get it off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not everything, which is not OTC over
the counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such, I believe that we will have
an increase in prescriptions from
[SPEAKER_01]: physicians for patients who are you,
who want to use medical cannabis for the
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment of their disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be less cumbersome of a process for
the doctor to prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there are some side effects of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prescriptions will last longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, because the, the prescription
for narcotics has to be filed with the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacy in a relatively short period of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other prescriptions are valid for a
longer period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course you can use this
prescription also in European member
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, you can't get cannabis of
course in a French.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could at least have it on you and
not be arrested theoretically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, theoretically.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the courts would throw it out,
you still could be arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't get, you won't get a THC rated
product with a German prescription,
[SPEAKER_01]: the French pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's clear, but theoretically it's
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but I think that the,
the major effect is, and I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: something which the industry is also
expecting that the prescription will
[SPEAKER_01]: increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody said, well, if you get the
legalization and if you can have home grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and the cannabis cultivation associations,
the medical market will decrease.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we, we don't be, I don't believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the number of market players in the
market don't believe that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may, because you know, a patient who is
currently using cannabis, even if he's a
[SPEAKER_01]: self payer and is not reimbursed by the
health insurance company, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: he gets, goes to the next pharmacy around
the corner, getting a product which has a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific quality, which is overseen by the
regulatory authorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not expensive like it was a few years
ago also, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Competition has lowered the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: The price has been significantly decreased
in comparison to 2017, 2018, 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 25 euros a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another question because will this
make, I know that now if pharmacies have
[SPEAKER_00]: to handle narcotics in a certain way in
Germany, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it, you receive it and then you
have to repackage it for yourself or
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the, I guess my question is,
cause when, when, when cannabis comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: the narcotics list, this will be a less
cumbersome process than for doctors to
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it be a less cumbersome process for
pharmacies to procure and purvey it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, in Germany, the cannabis
product is defined as an extemporaneous
[SPEAKER_01]: mixture, which why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in back in 2017, and it's always nice
to look back into history.
[SPEAKER_01]: The German government wanted to get the
products quickly on the market for the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients who were in need of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have an extemporaneous mixture,
which means there is a pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: which is in the pharmacy, but which needs
to be prepared by the pharmacist according
[SPEAKER_01]: to the prescription, you know,
that is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a ready-made pharmaceutical,
which you have to take, can take off the
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those pharmaceuticals need A, a marketing
authorization, which of course needs
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trials and B has to go through
the price finding process of the German
[SPEAKER_01]: GBA, Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss,
which is actually for pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_01]: fixing the price for the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was avoided by putting cannabis
products on the market as extemporaneous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extemporaneous mixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a but.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a but, if you have an
extemporaneous mixture, the pharmacist is
[SPEAKER_01]: obliged because he is doing something to
the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, quality control,
grinding, packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets a hundred percent surcharge on the
purchase price.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason why we had this 25 euros
at the beginning per gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mandated or was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was in the law actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pharmacist had to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course they were happy to do it,
but they had to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically they already had this
provision that didn't mean that they had
[SPEAKER_00]: to adhere to such stringent standards like
other narcotics might be with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the definition of cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extemporaneous mixtures will not change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what is clear, even if the
cannabis products will be taken out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: narcotics act and put into or transferred
into the new cannabis act, probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: same security measurements will apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will not be less security,
for example, putting it in a safe,
[SPEAKER_01]: having a safe place.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, this has been probably not happened
because the security measurements for
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis, from my point of view,
will not be reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the same handling process of
those products as if they were narcotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it seems like they had a little bit
of special status beforehand and now they
[SPEAKER_00]: won't have any, they'll just, they'll
actually, it'll be the opposite because it
[SPEAKER_00]: won't, cause any, another drug that
wouldn't be a narcotic would not have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be handled.
[SPEAKER_00]: As stringently as cannabis you think is
going to be still handled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, if you, well, if you have a
morphine, for example, a morphine rated
[SPEAKER_01]: product, this is the same as it's a
narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's handled especially, especially at the
other pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just put it on the open shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's really remained the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be no changes to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main issue of cannabis coming off
the narcotics list is that the doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: will be able to describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say with impunity,
but they just, they, they have more
[SPEAKER_00]: leeway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is from my point of view,
the, the most important effect of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: of taking cannabis and cannabis rated
products, THC rated products out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: German narcotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think this is the one is I think
to me, this is, this is almost the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that's happening with, I mean,
this is what's going to have the most
[SPEAKER_00]: effect immediately, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've also heard is there's no
more tender for domestic production in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany when this passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that they're not going to,
they're going to open up domestic
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't put quotas on the limits of how
much you can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you speak to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many rumors in the market right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in 2018, 2012, 2018 actually,
there was a way to find cultivators in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, which was a tender process.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we all know, the Bay farm actually
tendered out respective lots for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation of kind of medical cannabis in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And three companies have been assigned
licenses at the very end of that long
[SPEAKER_01]: lasting process, which was actually
stopped by the court in the first,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then then reestablished and Afria as
well as Demekan and Aurora won the
[SPEAKER_01]: respective 13 licenses for cultivation of
cannabis, which in fact was limited in
[SPEAKER_01]: quantity is still limited in quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually 10.4 metric tons over a
period of four years, which means 2.6
[SPEAKER_01]: metric tons if I'm not mistaken per year,
plus my plus a certain certain threshold
[SPEAKER_01]: of probably 10%, which could be,
could be actually cultivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is what happened at that point in
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now of course, also these licenses are
questioning, Hey, what is going to happen
[SPEAKER_01]: if the four years are over?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there another tender process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a licensing process for the
cultivation of medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can others actually participate then,
or what is the Bay farm actually planning?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bay farms currently is relatively
silent on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is of course pending thoughts at the
ministry of health.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is going to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have home grow with three
female plants per adult, you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation associations, and then you
have a limitation on the cultivation of
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis with a very strict tender
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really doesn't dive to right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such we will see, but at this point
in time, this is unclear.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no clear path forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you know what percentage of
approximately what percentage of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis consumed in Germany is
has to be imported?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you look into the import
quantities in the last years and let's
[SPEAKER_01]: look into 2023, but I don't have the last
quarter figures, but it was, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: around 23.4 metric tons without the last
quarter of imported cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be 90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say a little less than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, because of the 2.6 metric tons per
annum can be increased, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: by, by a certain percentage, but,
uh, 85, 80, 85% around that figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you ask the cultivator and the
German cultivators, they say, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a larger, they have a larger stake
in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, but if, if you start calculating
it, I would say it's in that region at
[SPEAKER_01]: least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, whereby, whereby German politicians
who are looking into the medical market
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis said, why don't we allow more
cultivation of medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we really need to import it from
various different other, other different
[SPEAKER_01]: countries like Canada and a number of
other countries right now exporting into
[SPEAKER_01]: the German market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't we actually strengthen the
German medical cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: which from my point of view is natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, we have, we know that we can do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that we have three cultivation,
uh, companies who, who are experts in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we try to at least serve the
market for medical cannabis, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least to a much higher extent from,
from German cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does German do the prices of,
uh, we won't talk about quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little bit subjective,
but we can quantify the prices quite
[SPEAKER_00]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the, the argument that,
well, the German cultivators will now ever
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to compete in Germany with other,
uh, foreign outsourcers like Columbia,
[SPEAKER_00]: Lesotho, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know what to think about it
because I actually have no idea what the
[SPEAKER_00]: costs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you can, you can grow
cannabis for less in some of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries, but then you still have all
these other import costs and customs cost
[SPEAKER_00]: and travel costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And shipping costs and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the point in time when the various,
uh, participants in that tender started to
[SPEAKER_01]: calculate, uh, what is a per gram price,
appropriate per gram price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can say that we were representing
one of those cultivators who did not win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and we actually were sitting together
and see what is the right price on a per
[SPEAKER_01]: gram basis, which makes it at least
economically feasible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and now we know, and that's official,
uh, that's public domain that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the per gram price from cultivation in
Germany is 220.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are selling at 220 per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're selling it at 220, 220 euro per
gram to the B4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're obviously then they're,
they're, their production costs are,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we could assume half like a euro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're getting into a little,
no, that's, that's curious ground.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that the, indeed, because,
uh, those, um, um, parties or those
[SPEAKER_01]: participants in the tender process,
they richly wanted to win it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they were significantly,
uh, calculating it and at the very low end
[SPEAKER_01]: as our client who did not win actually did
it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was still more than the 220.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question, which you have to ask
those licensees, are you making money?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, uh, of course, uh, you know,
the, uh, setting up of a cultivation site,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for medical cannabis in Germany is
expensive because, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the security millions and millions and
millions and millions of security
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements, of course, and all the
infrastructure which you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, uh, very difficult to say how much
at least this has to be amortized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, uh, and then of course
you're, you're, you're talking about a
[SPEAKER_01]: different price structure, of course,
than 220 per gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we'll see how this works out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, uh, I believe that the German
cultivation, cultivation sites,
[SPEAKER_01]: the German cultivators definitely can
compete with all the others around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, uh, from Canada, uh, from Holland,
uh, from Lissoto.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have the respective transport
costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, handling is easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and as such, but just what you said,
you know, cost structures in Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, are higher with regard to
energy and, uh, labor, uh, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what, what do you also need as a good
management and amortization can write,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, but, uh, you know, if you were going
to, to send, uh, a ton of, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis from Canada to, to Germany,
the respective transport costs are
[SPEAKER_01]: significant, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, that's all extremely interesting
stuff, Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, uh, uh, uh, I mean,
basically we have three major things
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the, well, a bunch of stuff with
the can, can G we've got the social are
[SPEAKER_00]: the, um, uh, cultivation associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we have, um, uh, now what about seeds
and clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people ask about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear seeds and clones are going to
become legal in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you speak to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they, they need to become legal in
some way, in which way is a little
[SPEAKER_01]: uncertain, uh, with respect to,
can you just, uh, order it by Amazon for
[SPEAKER_01]: your private cultivation, uh, at home?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what, what, what the German government
is thinking is that the, for, for the home
[SPEAKER_01]: grow for the growth, uh, or for the
cultivation of cannabis at home,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can actually get your, your seeds from
the cannabis associations, from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation associations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you're not a member,
you should actually be able to get your
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds for home grow from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the, from the cultivation
association.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So
[SPEAKER_01]: indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will see how this will work out
because the demand, you know, if,
[SPEAKER_01]: if the law would come into force on April
1st, 2024, and you allow home grow the
[SPEAKER_01]: demand for seeds for cultivation
equipment, you know, is enormous,
[SPEAKER_01]: enormous, enormous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question is, how can you serve
that demand?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you satisfy that demand?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something which, uh,
probably has not been rethought through so
[SPEAKER_01]: far.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is such an interesting conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're really teaching the folks,
our audience, so much about what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on in Germany, uh, right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Peter, where would you say the
opportunities are, the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities with this, with K&G,
with phase one, with even phase two,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and with the medical, uh, with
cannabis coming off the narcotics list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think people can, can come to
their own conclusion by, uh, deduce from,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, everything you said, uh, thus far of
maybe of, of, of what some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you enumerate a few industry,
uh, areas and sectors that you think are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to benefit from this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be definitely very positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say a boost, but very positive
for the medical market, for the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is already the biggest market in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't, it hasn't been growing so fast
as everybody wanted it to grow or as it
[SPEAKER_01]: has been predicted to grow, but it's
steadily growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some new ways, for example,
now, uh, in order to bring together
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacies, physicians, and, and patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some interesting,
uh, platforms who are doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so this market will definitely have a,
from my point of view, positive impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the new cannabis cassettes,
home grow, um, or, and the community
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, as I would call it for,
for the existing cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's probably not that interesting,
except for those who are providing
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment, who are providing seats,
uh, who are providing, uh, knowledge,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, who can advise, uh, those clubs,
how to set up the respective
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we know how the infrastructure will
look like, uh, from a state, from a state
[SPEAKER_01]: by state, uh, regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, I think these are the,
the, the, the winners, I would say from
[SPEAKER_01]: that, uh, if the second stage is coming,
uh, which we still haven't seen as a draft
[SPEAKER_01]: law, which was actually promised to be,
uh, at least put into the public by end of
[SPEAKER_01]: 20, by end of 2023, uh, then, uh,
uh, uh, we probably will see more winners
[SPEAKER_01]: and from the existing cannabis industry in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, because, you know, if you have this,
uh, pilot projects rolled out over
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, you need to serve these pilot
projects with, with cannabis, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is probably, which are probably not
the cultivation associations who are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to provide that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that it will be probably those,
uh, who are in the position and the three,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, license medical cannabis cultivators
are in the, in the top position for that
[SPEAKER_01]: for phase two for phase two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In, in what regard that they would
vertically consolidate and have their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you, or they would, oh,
I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they would supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they will supply, uh, you know,
they can definitely extend the limited
[SPEAKER_01]: production, which they have right now
under the 10.4 metric tons for four years
[SPEAKER_01]: before the medical side.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can definitely serve the market,
uh, increase their production and serve
[SPEAKER_01]: the market for, uh, for the pilot
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this sounds like when the, that the
phase two, the pilot projects,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are basically going to be de facto
dispensaries that when the EU capitulates,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I will, if I may, um, then those will
be the, the establishments and
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions that, uh, one could foresee
being grandfathered into a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and regulate, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with, with those regulation,
with those data, which you can then
[SPEAKER_01]: generate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, this is my favorite
solution for the, for the legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: process with those data, which you can
generate from these, uh, scientifically
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled pilot projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually lobby them, uh,
before the European commission and within
[SPEAKER_01]: the other member states for the
legalization on a broader basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's, that's, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what about brands, Peter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I'm curious, if you go to a
pharmacy, I think people hear about,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Germany at that cannabis is sold in
the pharmacies, uh, under medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, can that cannabis be branded?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you, when you go and buy a package at
the pharmacy, does it have to be a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a benign sterile package or could it say,
could it have like, uh, cookies on it or
[SPEAKER_00]: like the cookie cookies brand with a lot
with a, uh, a brand can, are there any
[SPEAKER_00]: brands in the German pharmacies?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the question is what, what is a
brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you mean a logo and a description
description of the, of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes, of course we have, of course,
uh, uh, various brands already in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the German market from various,
uh, companies who are importers,
[SPEAKER_01]: who have maybe their own brand or using
different brand bedroom can has different
[SPEAKER_01]: brands, for example, uh, as, as kind of
medical has different brand brands for
[SPEAKER_01]: their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I say brand, I don't mean just
the name of the strain necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could there be like a colorful sticker
with a, the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it really made a pharmaceutical and
has to be a pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you say brands, that's like the
strain name.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is straight push or whatever.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, with the specific of THC content,
CBD content, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter, you are down here in Slovenia,
uh, to speak in front of the national
[SPEAKER_00]: council, which is basically our Bundesrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're speaking tomorrow, uh,
in front of a packed house, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the national council.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are extremely glad to have you down
here and giving the Slovenian national
[SPEAKER_00]: council, your opinion on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do you want to just give us a,
a, a little hint into what you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, or maybe I could reframe the question
and saying, what do you think a country
[SPEAKER_00]: like Slovenia should do at this stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, um, what should they take from
Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should they, uh, not take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what are you going to talk about
tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you suggest Slovenia, what do you
suggest Slovenia does?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I think it's a big advantage
that other countries are looking into the
[SPEAKER_01]: possibility to use cannabis, first of all,
for medical purposes, but also thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about the legalization process like Czech
Republic is doing it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think that's a big step forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slovenia has always been very cautious
looking at what's going to happen in other
[SPEAKER_01]: European member states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and as such, I will definitely report
about what I believe is a real success
[SPEAKER_01]: about the medical market for cannabis in
Germany, uh, and to show the developments,
[SPEAKER_01]: show the, uh, the numbers which we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: For patients, the quantities, and of
course also discuss a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, whether would it be better to have a
local production rather than import,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, or is it better to use the already
established roots of importation?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, I think, one, one piece of my,
my presentation tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, uh, of my, from my personal point
of view, uh, cannabis is, uh, a real good
[SPEAKER_01]: addition to the possibilities,
uh, for different, different, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the treatment of different diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you look into chronic pain
and what cannabis can do for those
[SPEAKER_01]: patients, uh, who are using other,
uh, medications, which have probably more
[SPEAKER_01]: side effects or not, uh, but, uh,
who, who are looking for a different
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cannabis is a very good
alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such, it has definitely its place
from my point of view in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, of course, then we're talking
about the recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and from my point of view,
I will definitely point out that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the scientific, uh, the controlled
pilot project from my point of view is the
[SPEAKER_01]: best step forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look into what, uh, first of all,
controlled cultivation, controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, then gaining data,
uh, getting, uh, really knowledge,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, what, uh, cannabis for recreational
purposes can do, uh, and then actually
[SPEAKER_01]: decide what, how, how a legalization
process can go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter Holmberg, the man, the myth,
the legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so honored to have you in Slovenia
and speaking to the national council
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow.
