[SPEAKER_00]: Give it up for Burinder Bhallar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The morning after the after-party.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so wonderful to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honour to be here today to see so
many familiar faces, meet new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been amazing conversations and
debates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to the interactions
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: As mentioned, my name is Burinder Bhallar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I serve as Senior Vice President of
Corporate Affairs with Brains Biaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: and today we'll talk about advancing the
cannabinoid scientific landscape but first
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to tell you when presenting I was
researching evidence and what's key and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the evidence that points to when
making presentations says that if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate children and kids you get a
more captive audience so I want you to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet my younger son, Anik.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just had his first hockey game two
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anik, my native language is Punjabi and
Anik in Punjabi means honour, dignity and
[SPEAKER_00]: pride.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's even more compelling evidence
that if you can incorporate pets somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: you get even a more captive audience and
with AI look what we can produce these
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I hopefully have your
attention we can get into the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today we're going to talk about
advancing the cannabinoid scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about how using the right
molecules we can advance clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do a lot of great innovations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do a lot of great formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can attract the nutraceutical and
pharmaceutical industries to be champions
[SPEAKER_00]: in creating therapeutics and therapies
that are needed for millions around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that with the goal of providing
solutions to patients, loved ones and
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll also say that we know there's a
lot of pathways to providing therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the medical pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a pharmaceutical pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's full spectrum, broad spectrum you
know using terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is all part of the solutions and
this is the approach we have taken to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on cannabinoids because we are
utilizing all of our executive teams
[SPEAKER_00]: experience within the pharmaceutical
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are a part of that solution of that
full gamut that we'll bring to you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a quick little background on
who we are at BrainsBio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're evidence-based science-led pioneer
of cannabinoid health and wellness
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our business could be summarized into four
verticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Namely we provide active pharmaceutical
ingredients to the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have applications and enhanced delivery
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also are into pharmaceutical
development where we create new chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: entities for high and unmet needs of
pioneering the scientific landscape and
[SPEAKER_00]: working with researchers around the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take all of our foundational work
on the API side that we produce and we
[SPEAKER_00]: bring nutraceutical and dietary supplement
products with pure high CBD providing
[SPEAKER_00]: finished dosage forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them that come with certifications
such as NSF, novel foods validated both in
[SPEAKER_00]: the EU and also the UK, tested by the
World Anti-Doping Agency Laboratory and
[SPEAKER_00]: also informed choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly we are pioneering and
pioneering novel evidences and support
[SPEAKER_00]: products for the animal health side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that we do on the human side
we bring to the animal health side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now why do we do this and what excites all
of us to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it's not just us as industry
executives.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just us as sector folks talking
about the excitement what's happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's the scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the medical community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the doctors that want to see the
evidence and data what can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know what the evidence says that
companies that can successfully modify the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system and understand how
the different cannabinoids work within the
[SPEAKER_00]: body can unlock powerful potential
therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not just as I mentioned us
saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lou you look at the potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at the quotes on the screen
coming from eminent researchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's so important with the
right team and the right focus we can
[SPEAKER_00]: unlock a lot of positive therapies out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't come without challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of challenges and one of
the challenges that we see is a patient
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are outliers, places like right here
in Germany, places in North America where
[SPEAKER_00]: patients do have access.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's use the UK as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now currently today there are two to
three million people that could rely on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid based therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two to three million people, yet only
25,000 are getting access.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about less than 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of the 124,000 general
practitioners that could be prescribing,
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 are trained to prescribe, but yet only
about 110 of those are prescribing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, less than 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not the solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the medical community doctors to
become champions of this industry to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one of the challenges also is for the
doctors is that there's only been two to
[SPEAKER_00]: three fully market authorized drugs
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the time gap in
between, you look at the drenabinal
[SPEAKER_00]: approved in 1985 for nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 1992 for weight loss and HIV
patients, we had Epidiolex in 2018 for two
[SPEAKER_00]: rare conditions and Satifax still waiting
approval in a lot of jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why we need to ensure we get
the pharmaceutical industry excited to
[SPEAKER_00]: become champions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we excite them?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get them involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, pharma's gonna get excited when we
can create new chemical entities,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the drug that we're producing is
novel, when there's sufficient data to
[SPEAKER_00]: support market authorization, and when we
have the confidence that patients will be
[SPEAKER_00]: reimbursed and that your product's gonna
be commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, you need to ensure that we
have key opinion leaders that are gonna go
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and endorse and become champions
of your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, your clinical program also has to be
robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, clinical programs can take up to a
decade and cost a billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got to ensure to get market
authorized, and you gotta realize too
[SPEAKER_00]: though, when you're going through a
clinical program, by the time you've
[SPEAKER_00]: finished, your drug is probably gonna be
genericized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to show significant
improvement over the current standard of
[SPEAKER_00]: care to ensure that you can get premium
pricing and recoup your benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the solution now?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the pathway for us to get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy, it takes time, and I will
emphasize there are no shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is a lot of myths and a lot
of false assumptions within the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: at large early on, but just because that
we're dealing with a natural plant-based
[SPEAKER_00]: substance, that regulators around the
world will provide fast tracks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to bring cannabinoid-based
drugs, pharmaceutical drugs, there are no
[SPEAKER_00]: shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to follow the established biotech
and pharma regulatory pathways that are
[SPEAKER_00]: enshrined in law.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know by introducing new chemical
entities with strong patents and
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrating care that's gonna be above
the current standard, we can get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of anecdotal evidence out
there, there's a lot of proof of concept
[SPEAKER_00]: studies out there, there's a lot of
observational studies, but a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have patents or limited patents that
are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, I would say cannabinoid
studies need to follow the accepted
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory pathways with minimum
thresholds that exist out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that includes having two randomized
double-blind controlled studies that
[SPEAKER_00]: showcase your efficacy and your safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, to emphasize, there are no
shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enshrined in law, it's regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to follow the process,
we can bring these therapeutics out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is complicated, it does take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us to get there, the pathway you
have to follow, you got to ensure that we
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the pharmacology behind it,
understand the biology, understand how the
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors are binding, understanding the
ascending and descending sequencing,
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding our dosing and PK.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that put through a phase one,
two, three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind, not everything makes it
to a phase three, not everything makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: to a phase two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the areas that could
assist to attract pharma?
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard me talk about patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we want them to be champions,
we got to have patents along with our new
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical entities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're looking for is composition
of matter patents where you can get about
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in order to have a drug patentable,
what do we need and what are we looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to show that it's better than
what's currently being used out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be non-obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there has to be evidence to support
that it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have a clear description of how
it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means you got to understand how the
receptors are going to bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to understand the pathways and its
impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do all of the investigational
pharmacology, biology, and then it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: approved without shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are ways we can do things more
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fast tracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also de-risk some of the
investments that are going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could look at doing in vitro and in
vivo studies over human, which relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot less cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing in vitro where you're looking
at the cell wells and how the receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: will bond to it, you can determine if it's
toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can determine the drug interactions
relatively cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a saying in the industry,
kill early, kill cheaply.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not getting the indications that
you're going, kill it and go look for a
[SPEAKER_00]: new lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't plug a dead horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not getting the signals,
move along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can look at your animal models.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could look at developing a robust
in vivo program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at your drug interactions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at if it's toxic or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a drug that's so effective,
but if it's going to be toxic,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to get approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, kill early, kill cheap,
don't spend five years or a lifetime on
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you know it's not going to
get approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing we need to do is start
with the end in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is so critical to understand your
target market profile and your target
[SPEAKER_00]: product profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to differentiate your
product, your drug, amongst the
[SPEAKER_00]: competition that's out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how is it going to be above the
current standard of care?
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all components that we need
to use to develop the regulatory pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your therapeutic areas for your
target market profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the target patient profiles?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the patient characteristics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the target product profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at the age of the patient,
the source of clinical differentiator,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this involved moving forward with
having the end in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the target market profile helps you
get there and move along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all of this is challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But done right with the right team and the
right people, there are rewards.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at Epidolics right now,
approaching a billion dollars and in 2022,
[SPEAKER_00]: grows 16%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the pharma industry in general is
growing at about 4%, Diabonol,
[SPEAKER_00]: despite having generics out there,
it's at about 400 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still don't know the full effects
of Sadafax because it's not fully approved
[SPEAKER_00]: in all jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaders need to leave and leave people in
better places than they found them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a pathway there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is ways to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, we need to ensure we
follow that pathway to bring the
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic benefits to the millions that
need these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you some examples of what we're
doing at BrainsBioCeuticals with our
[SPEAKER_00]: partners and how we're walking this path
and trying to be courageous to do full
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical programming, finish dosage form
products, and what we're doing on
[SPEAKER_00]: innovations so we can bring pharmaceutical
drugs to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for us, our drug development program
started off by us getting involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical studies, supplying our active
pharmaceutical ingredients to over 30
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-clinical and clinical studies
globally, of which we're supporting a
[SPEAKER_00]: phase three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we moved on to our own in human
studies where we're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers around the globe, researchers
such as Mount Sinai that are using our
[SPEAKER_00]: specially designed and formulated capsules
on a phase two study for opium harm
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I was born and raised in Vancouver,
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: In North America, in Canada, and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: alone, every day we're losing 150 people
to opiate overdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 150 deaths daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so critical for us to
be champions of potential therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say potential because we're still
going through a clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a way, as a mechanism to help
support and help save lives and help
[SPEAKER_00]: people around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we moved on to our own drug
discovery where we are developing our new
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical entities, focusing on neurology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will lead our own pre-clinical and
clinical studies in those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our objectives are simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to improve the efficacy of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to improve the specificity and
targets for research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to have efficient drug
delivery formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to do this all in partnership
with world-leading partnerships with
[SPEAKER_00]: innovators and collaborators around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what does the future hold?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what guides us towards the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we've done is we've taken our CBD
API, which is an industry standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've produced over 500 consistent
batches, supplied it in over 30 clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trials globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've backed that up with technical
packages, which includes a U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: drug master file, which has been
referenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also includes the AU active substance
master file and a drug substance IMPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take that work, what we did on the CBD
side, and we are now developing other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids as active pharmaceutical
ingredients to provide more options for
[SPEAKER_00]: research, more solutions out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, very proud to say we have THC Delta 9
in a solid form available for clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: research now as an active pharmaceutical
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have CBN and CBG also available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've taken that foundation on the
active side, and we have isolated
[SPEAKER_00]: nutraceutical products for both human and
animal use available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take potential collaborations with
beverages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at animal health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can look at how athletes are looking at
recovery, inflammation, and pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work with sports science and sports
nutrition on the nutraceutical side,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe all of this happens through
partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't do innovation on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're very proud to be here today with
DSM Fermanich.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very proud partners with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And together, Brains Bio and DSM
Fermanich, we provide end-to-end solutions
[SPEAKER_00]: right from your active pharmaceutical
ingredients to clinical trials to finished
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the key areas in innovation
that we are working with DSM Fermanich,
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a lead on this, is in four areas,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so critically important.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is enhancing stability, where we know
that stability is paramount to the success
[SPEAKER_00]: of an active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are we going to enhance solutions
for enhanced stability?
[SPEAKER_00]: Enhancing the solubility, where DSM
Fermanich has developed proprietary powder
[SPEAKER_00]: cache technologies capable of enhancing
the solubility, providing more options out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enhancing our bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to provide lower dosage
forms and provide more options?
[SPEAKER_00]: So by means of lipid encapsulation,
nanomulsification, or liposomal delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, and I think this one's very key,
providing targeted delivery solutions,
[SPEAKER_00]: targeting the delivery of active specific
regions, particularly in the GI tract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something where DSM Fermanich
is leading.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're proud to support them on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing clinical data on this study,
all to provide patient-centric solutions
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be championed by our medical
community, by the pharma industry there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a real live example recently I can give
you of that partnership and collaboration
[SPEAKER_00]: that's taking place is we have OMG Pharma
also here from Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brains Bio is an API, and DSM
Fermanich, working with OMG, have now
[SPEAKER_00]: developed orally dissolvable tablets for
insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's providing innovation solid oral
drug forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's providing more options.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's through partnerships that this is
all going to take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the foundation of all of this work for
us comes through starting with the right
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with the right molecules and the
active ingredients can assist your
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can assist in your innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can assist in different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can assist in providing patient-centric
solutions That is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen it time and time again
where folks have started a clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: program only to come to phase two,
three, be compromised, and have to start
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's time and that's money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you heard me say, leaders lead and
lead people in a better place than they
[SPEAKER_00]: found them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaders also uplift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaders collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaders don't leave people behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a father, I want to ensure I don't
leave my older son behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my older son, Meva.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's eight years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to be a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Meva in Punjabi means the reward of
hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I approach things, when I approach
work and when I think of the lens,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of everything in the lens of my
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the world had more anek, more honor,
dignity, and pride, we could give the
[SPEAKER_00]: world more Meva, the reward of hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to
come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us in this courageous journey to
provide therapeutic benefits to the
[SPEAKER_00]: millions that need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can provide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come partner with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys have a great rest of the day
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safe travels from where you come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for having me here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the Bilar, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the International Cannabis
Business Conference.
