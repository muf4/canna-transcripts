[SPEAKER_03]: We're here at the Grand Hyatt on Kauai for
the ICBC conference on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good feeling to know that Hawaii is
starting to get on the map because to be
[SPEAKER_04]: real like Hawaii is just known for its
beaches and tourism and so this gives us a
[SPEAKER_04]: chance to really shine in ways that are
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a writer, publisher and activist and
I'm here at the convention to help people
[SPEAKER_00]: produce better pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are talking about CBD and
talking about cannabis as medicine but I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to talk with you about cannabis as
something that liberates your mind and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's to me as important as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Reggae music traditionally is the Rastaman
gospel music.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Rastaman utilized the herb not to get
high or just for recreation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more of a, it has a spiritual
significance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gramps Morgan, you know, in the group,
his son had to have a quarter of his brain
[SPEAKER_05]: cut out at birth because he was having
seizures internally.
[SPEAKER_05]: The mother of his child being a scientist
created their own brand of CBD oil called
[SPEAKER_05]: Messiah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sort of have like a walking,
talking, breathing case study of why we
[SPEAKER_05]: want to be in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a hard story to tell and it's
kind of been one that I've kind of kept to
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to tell it without, you know,
breaking down into tears and staying
[SPEAKER_02]: professional at the same time but again I
see now the value in it and I believe that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of just my duty now and it's in
my hands to be able to help other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sharing it was phenomenal and I'd love
to do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, I've been to many conferences and
conventions and the cannabis ones are
[SPEAKER_03]: always the fun ones and you meet a lot of
people and you network and it's a good
[SPEAKER_03]: group of people to be with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when we're looking at an
industry which is just growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So look forward to being a part of this or
helping out in any way I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never ever get any kind of
commercialization if I wouldn't have got a
[SPEAKER_01]: ticket to come here to what it was that it
made it worth it and yeah I mean it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful and I really do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great feeling man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean we're learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We look forward to getting deeper involved
in becoming activists even for this herb.
[SPEAKER_05]: you you
