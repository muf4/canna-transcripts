[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm thrilled to be here and talk about
intellectual property perspective for the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis industry today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to share some insights about
advertising cannabis and CBD products in
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also will talk about brand
protection in Europe, which is really
[SPEAKER_05]: important for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start with the advertising.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will focus on, I think, the most
important products, which are medicinal
[SPEAKER_05]: products, cosmetics, and food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start with the medicinal products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis or CBD-containing drug is subject
to prescription in Germany, as you surely
[SPEAKER_05]: know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So medicinal products subject to
prescription may be advertised only among
[SPEAKER_05]: health care professionals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it may not be advertised among
consumers and consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, if you do advertise it among
health care professionals, you have to
[SPEAKER_05]: observe there are also some limits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, misleading advertising is not
permitted.
[SPEAKER_05]: I give you some examples under which it
would be misleading.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, if therapeutic efficacy or
effects are attributed, which the medical
[SPEAKER_05]: products do not have, that would be not
allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the impression is falsely created that
success can be expected with certainty,
[SPEAKER_05]: of course, illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: If false or deceptive statements are made
about the composition, also not allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you use expert opinions, which is often
done, or testimonials, this must be
[SPEAKER_05]: scientific and properly cited.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do not comply with these rules,
you face jail time, or at least you get a
[SPEAKER_05]: fine, and of course, your material will be
confiscated.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think more problematic is the food
and dietary supplements.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are some examples I made screenshots
of over the weekend when I did this
[SPEAKER_05]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are all claims from German websites.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD has been shown to inhibit the appetite
cravings, or CBD helps with pain,
[SPEAKER_05]: stress, sleep disorders, or migraine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question is if these examples are
allowed under German law.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you have to observe the act against
unfair competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in general, of course, unfair
commercial practices are illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: A commercial practice shall be regarded as
misleading if it contains false statements
[SPEAKER_05]: regarding the main characteristics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, we do not have that much
case law in Germany on advertisement
[SPEAKER_05]: claims yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a lot about regulatory
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I found one example, a recent
example from the court in Munich.
[SPEAKER_05]: There, too, it is unfair to advertise with
a statement in a prominent place where,
[SPEAKER_05]: too, CBD content is 10%.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is only explained in the small
print that the product actually only
[SPEAKER_05]: contains 10% CBD liquid.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a big difference between that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there, the court held that would be a
misleading and false statement,
[SPEAKER_05]: just to give you one example.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about food and dietary supplements.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, you have to observe the EU
health claim regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: There, too, the use of nutrition and
health claims shall not be false,
[SPEAKER_05]: ambiguous, or misleading.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nutrition and health claims shall be based
on and substantiated by generally accepted
[SPEAKER_05]: scientific data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at last, health claims shall be
permitted unless they are included in a
[SPEAKER_05]: special list, which is part of that
regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, until today,
CBD is not included in that list.
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, specific claims linked to CBD,
linking CBD to health, is not permitted
[SPEAKER_05]: for food.
[SPEAKER_05]: So avoid these health claims.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry to be a party pooper here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the moment, this is the law.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if your product is not a drug,
you're not allowed to claim that it's
[SPEAKER_05]: beneficial for your health.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to give you an example,
[SPEAKER_05]: to which large extent the German courts
say what a health claim is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are all examples from German
cases.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you claim your food keeps you young,
that would be not allowed if your food
[SPEAKER_05]: contains CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you only say it has a health
benefit, or it is good for the body,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's good for my organism, it strengthens
the body's defenses, helps to overcome
[SPEAKER_05]: phases of weakness.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is actually not so bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: But under German case law, this would be a
health claim.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the health claim regulation applies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And CBD products are not in the list of
the health claims.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be forbidden.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or slim and fit, there's another example.
[SPEAKER_05]: Facilitate sleep, calm and gentle sleep,
or body comes to rest would be
[SPEAKER_05]: problematic.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last thing I would like to share with
you about food that's specifically
[SPEAKER_05]: important for the German market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you are a manufacturer, and you claim
that this is not a drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only a dietary supplement.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say still you advertise it as a
drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from the overall get up, the claims and
the advertising you use, it looks like a
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal product.
[SPEAKER_05]: In these cases, the courts would say that
it is a drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have a problem because you
didn't get drug approval in advance.
[SPEAKER_05]: So whenever, yeah, just watch out not to
make the presentation of your product to
[SPEAKER_05]: look like too much as a medicinal product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because then it could be held that it is
actually a drug, even though you did not
[SPEAKER_05]: plan that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is specifically important for the
German market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last thing is the cosmetic products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I made some, here are some examples
from German websites I've found.
[SPEAKER_05]: There too, it was claimed that CBD
products, particularly a good against skin
[SPEAKER_05]: diseases, scientists have investigated.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD fights the cause of acne at its roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the question is whether this would
be allowed under German law.
[SPEAKER_05]: So under the cosmetic regulations,
whatever you say, it has to be true,
[SPEAKER_05]: of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it is claimed on the product that it
contains a specific ingredient,
[SPEAKER_05]: the ingredient shall be deliberately
present.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or marketing communications shall not
imply that expressions of opinions are
[SPEAKER_05]: verified claims unless the opinion
reflects verifiable evidence.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you always need verifiable evidence
when you make a claim for your cosmetic
[SPEAKER_05]: product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Further, you need evidential support.
[SPEAKER_05]: So claims for cosmetic products shall be
supported by adequate and against again,
[SPEAKER_05]: verifiable evidence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Evidence for claim substantiation shall
take into account state of the art
[SPEAKER_05]: practices.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at last, where studies are being used
as evidence, they shall be relevant to
[SPEAKER_05]: that product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just not using any evidence.
[SPEAKER_05]: It always have to be exactly for your
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you can use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was in the limited amount of time,
a really narrow insights about the strict
[SPEAKER_05]: rules of advertising in the cannabis field
until today.
[SPEAKER_05]: At last, I would like to share some
thoughts about brand protection.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm handling trademarks for the cannabis
industry since 2017, obviously,
[SPEAKER_05]: in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I brought you some recent case law
about cannabis trademarks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that one is a quite important one.
[SPEAKER_05]: One from the European Court of Justice,
the Cannabis Store Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, it was rejected.
[SPEAKER_05]: The European Court stated that this would
be contrary to public policy or to
[SPEAKER_05]: accepted principles of morality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I find it quite astonishing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a beautiful trademark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow the courts saw it differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: They acknowledged that the cannabis
consumption is generally illegal in the
[SPEAKER_05]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, a violation of the public order
in other EU countries would be sufficient
[SPEAKER_05]: for the rejection of the mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and that was a starting point for many
more trademark decisions we had afterwards
[SPEAKER_05]: with terms of some for cannabis products
like this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's quite recent.
[SPEAKER_05]: A decision from the Board of the Appeal of
the European Trademark Office.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it says it is contrary to the
public policy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The marks conveyed a message related to
the consumption of prohibited and harmful
[SPEAKER_05]: substances and therefore were rejected.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also this one, which is I think not so
drastic, but still it was rejected,
[SPEAKER_05]: the well weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here this is quite interesting because the
applicant cited the ruling of the European
[SPEAKER_05]: Court of Justice from November last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: There too, as you probably all know,
the cannabidiol was held is legal for
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing over from France, I think to
Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was held that this cannot be stopped.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be freely marketed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they held that hemp is actually legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the applicant argued, how can you say
this infringes public policy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the opinion of the board was not
changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the mark got rejected, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_05]: All these on the left side are certain
types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: All these were rejected because again,
contrary to the public policy and the
[SPEAKER_05]: principles of morality, also the various
weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the hemp fest.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see, despite the greater tolerance to
what the consumption of Mariana within the
[SPEAKER_05]: EU, it's still problematic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So until today, I would advise my clients
not to use words like Mariana,
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, hemp, grass, pot, weed,
hash, or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you probably get a rejection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, and at last, we also have purely
descriptive trademarks.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are some examples.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheese is also a type of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Know your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The court said, well, that only says,
well, you know what is in your product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's purely descriptive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And whenever you have a purely descriptive
trademark, you cannot monopolize it and
[SPEAKER_05]: you cannot register it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same happened to just CBD,
Canna Farm, Meaty Hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ease was also one I handled and lost,
unfortunately, because the court said,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, it was not the court.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the Board of Appeal of the European
Trademark Office.
[SPEAKER_05]: They held, well, this only tells the
consumer what the CBD in the product makes
[SPEAKER_05]: to your body.
[SPEAKER_05]: It releases.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's purely descriptive and not
legible for trademark protection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, thank you so much for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: May I go back to the trademark you for the
Dutch for the Dutch one, the cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Could it be a solution that you first put
it in the Benelux?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you could trademark and then maybe
afterwards go to the European?
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that that was like a trick
many, many years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whenever you because I'm from Germany and
the German patent office was really
[SPEAKER_05]: strict.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we did, we advise our clients,
go to the Benelux and then you file an
[SPEAKER_05]: international trademark.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then nobody really looks anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened there?
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think this still works because
when you your idea is we go to the
[SPEAKER_05]: Benelux, you probably get it because they
are very easy to get trademarks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still what I heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you file an international trademark
based on the on that mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then this application goes to the
specific trademark offices where you apply
[SPEAKER_05]: for, let's say Germany, US or the European
Union.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is an examiner and he or she
will examine the trademark under their
[SPEAKER_05]: law.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think that this will help you
just because you have the Benelux mark.
[SPEAKER_05]: The German examiner will still say,
well, here in Germany, you don't get the
[SPEAKER_05]: trademark protection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I answer your question?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, madam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question related to cosmetics,
CBD cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you in the brochure or whatever,
which you hand out, maybe not to the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients, but to the pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you, for example, state an oil
cream, which you put on your derm,
[SPEAKER_01]: is possible or can be anti-inflammatory as
a can and syndromes haven't worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a borderline case.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just have to whenever you make claims
like that can be anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_05]: You actually need evidence for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot just say something.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't say it may be anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: People have reported that some people say.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what is possible?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see that on websites.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see that at clients.
[SPEAKER_05]: They say there are a lot of research done
yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, we are at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: We cannot say for 100% sure, but we see
the trend goes there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to be honest, to say where we are
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, actually, me as a consumer,
from a consumer side, I would feel more
[SPEAKER_05]: confident with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just promise something which you don't
really maybe cannot until now.
[SPEAKER_06]: In America, there's always a little
asterisk.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then very small print.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has not been proven by the FDA or
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're probably lying, but we're doing our
best.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, yeah, that's a good solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many thanks for the nice insights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to elaborate with the topic
claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can make claims as soon as they are
supported by verifiable data.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how does the law define verifiable
data?
[SPEAKER_03]: As a scientist, I guess that's scientific
data.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even within scientific literature,
there are different levels of evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, the use of CBD as anti-acne
is published in the cell model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this preclinical data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know which biochemical mechanism
makes this possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a fact in science.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you use this claim?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do the law means randomized clinical
trial placebo control?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this preclinical data.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a double blind randomized study.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, because for that, there are only four
applications of cannabis which actually
[SPEAKER_03]: have this kind of study.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you go beyond these four
applications, you cannot use preclinical
[SPEAKER_03]: data if it's published in Nature or
Science or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's a great risk that it would
be illegal.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so you need patient data and hotel
data.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you use it, you just have to make clear
that this is not a randomized double et
[SPEAKER_05]: cetera study.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so you could use it and be clear that
this is based on this level of evidence in
[SPEAKER_03]: science.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, because it brings me to my second
question, which is, I mean, you give many
[SPEAKER_03]: examples regarding food, for instance,
what you cannot write.
[SPEAKER_02]: Health claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: Health claims, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what will be an example of what you can
actually write?
[SPEAKER_03]: At least one example.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still have the context.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's very clear what you cannot
write.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what could you write?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have probably, but this is very
specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, of course, but we do have case law
where the courts say that might be OK to
[SPEAKER_05]: say becumlich, which is in English good
for your, what is it in English?
[SPEAKER_05]: Digestive system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Digestive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are some expressions where they
say, well, actually, this doesn't really
[SPEAKER_05]: refer to the health.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's always about if you say you feel
really better, it makes an influence on
[SPEAKER_05]: your body, then it's a health claim.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, as I said, this is a very
difficult question, a difficult matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's from case to case.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to evaluate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not an easy one to just answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if my anti-acne cream, CBD cream,
says, OK, this can help you address acne
[SPEAKER_03]: with the asterisk based on preclinical
data that you can find in this scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: journal, I might get away with that or?
[SPEAKER_03]: She's going to have to start charging you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't we have a chat outside and we
make her a special deal?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have one more over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, let's say my wetest dream comes true
and cannabis becomes fully legalized and
[SPEAKER_04]: we have a regulated market here in Germany
on a EU member state level.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it mean for this topic on an EU
level?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it would be a big change.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, then I guess it would not take
long until it's included in the list for
[SPEAKER_05]: the admitted health claims.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can actually claim that your
food is beneficial for your health,
[SPEAKER_05]: which until now, I mean, you're not even
allowed in Germany to bring it on the
[SPEAKER_05]: market in the first place.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not talking about advertisement.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as you said, if we're in the future
and we can do that, and then I guess you
[SPEAKER_05]: have to wait until it's also in the list
of the health claims.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can use beneficial health
claims for the food.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to expand on the question before
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you think that for health claims,
it would need to test the product
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for health benefits instead
of the isolated compound?
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean what is the procedure to get
accepted in that list?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you take results from science and look
at the isolated product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you need to take your product
that contains CBD to test for these health
[SPEAKER_00]: claims?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an appeal lawyer, not so much
regulatory.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't deal with the regulatory issues as
colleagues of me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know how the procedure works to
get registered as a health claim,
[SPEAKER_05]: as an admitted health claim.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't want to answer that because I
don't really know what exactly you need to
[SPEAKER_05]: do, if it's the ingredient or the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it's the ingredient.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was wonderful and perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for taking time to answer
the questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: One more time for Margaret Knitter from
SKW Schwarz.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
Thank you.
