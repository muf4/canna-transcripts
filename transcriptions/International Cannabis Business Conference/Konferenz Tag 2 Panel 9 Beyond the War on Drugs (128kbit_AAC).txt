[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Stephen Murphy and we have 30
minutes to solve global cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations which should be doable on a
Friday evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I think it's very nice to be able to
talk about beyond the war of drugs and to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of, you know, one, recognize the
impact that has been made in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: seven years especially coming out of North
America which is now transferring over to
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we're in a crazy young
industry which we are kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: to use an analogy, we're flying a plane
with both hands tied behind our backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, there is a recent, you know,
there's a recent major UN report that came
[SPEAKER_00]: out during the week which, you know,
called for an end of the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds great and it sounds super,
super positive but really when you
[SPEAKER_00]: translate the social mission of ending the
war on drugs into the reality of
[SPEAKER_00]: conducting business and actually working
to bring a business face to drugs and make
[SPEAKER_00]: it more agreeable and certainly more
professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how, we talked of conscious
investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get investors excited about
ending the war on drugs and that part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the story for businesses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, Aaron, if you want to kick it off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think we really, it's all
about aligning self-interest with the
[SPEAKER_02]: cause of ending prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, what we're seeing across
the country is this emerging, emergent
[SPEAKER_02]: legal cannabis industry that, you know,
investors are just seeing like as an
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity, like any other opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we're, you know,
kind of the gospel we preach is that if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're invested in this industry,
then you are an advocate and you must
[SPEAKER_02]: invest in the federal policy or state,
federal, international policy reforms
[SPEAKER_02]: necessary for the industry to prosper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I would add to that that
there's not always an alignment between
[SPEAKER_03]: the self-interest of a particular business
and good policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if, you know, I am Joe's megacorp,
I want Joe's megacorp to have a monopoly
[SPEAKER_03]: on cannabis, which is terrible policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's, what I notice is that there's
friction with, you know, especially like
[SPEAKER_03]: the larger companies, larger investors
with wanting to have market dominance
[SPEAKER_03]: versus what I think I would argue,
many would argue, is better policy,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is an ecosystem of lots of smaller
businesses that are doing things
[SPEAKER_03]: conscientiously, are paying attention to
like environmental considerations,
[SPEAKER_03]: equity considerations, things of that
nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the initial legalization effort
and whatever country we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, you can get investors behind that
concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I want to be in the cannabis space,
it has to be legal in order for me to
[SPEAKER_03]: invest.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have, you know, a bank that's gonna
finance that, that's gonna be a variable
[SPEAKER_03]: issue in different places.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have to answer to shareholders or a
board of directors, you know, those
[SPEAKER_03]: fundamental issues of legality are
threshold issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you get past that threshold issue
of legalization, then, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it becomes more complicated and what that
legalization looks like itself also can
[SPEAKER_03]: become very complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where you end up with like a
lot of like limited markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see this a lot in the States,
particularly on the East coast,
[SPEAKER_03]: where there is, you know, a set number of
licenses and what you have there typically
[SPEAKER_03]: are like the publicly traded companies
that are publicly traded in Canada because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not allowed to be publicly traded
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: that dominate these markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the way that that translates to
the consumer is not very many options and
[SPEAKER_03]: not very many especially good options.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they go to their local cannabis store
and they have the options of like five
[SPEAKER_03]: different things that are in 20 different
jars and it's all pretty gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not exactly lined up very easily,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fist bump for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, you guys really nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that what's lost here in making
something that is a magical mystical
[SPEAKER_01]: unexplained ethereal plant medicine into a
consumer packaged good for capitalism,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a natural disconnect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the people that I've seen
do the most well business-wise,
[SPEAKER_01]: success-wise in California have been the
ones that bake in a triple bottom line
[SPEAKER_01]: where they know that love is lucrative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turnover in companies, lack of loyalty,
bad quality products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's proof of concept, there's data
that shows that that does not scale
[SPEAKER_01]: markets, that does not welcome new users,
that does not bring innovation and polish
[SPEAKER_01]: and sophistication to the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have proof that shows that if
you don't invest in your people and the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, people like NCIA, Aaron,
you know, works with the National Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry Association, you know,
ask yourselves, are you part of a trade
[SPEAKER_01]: organization?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking to each other?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened in California?
[SPEAKER_01]: We fought like cats and dogs in front of
the state capital, in front of the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they looked at us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, they're going to go with big
pharma and big ag and big tobacco because
[SPEAKER_01]: we weren't on the same page before we
showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have common language about what
sustainability meant for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people that are doing the best in
the Bay Area and in LA and California are
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are giving back.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we use the word equity, we have a
very, in the United States, because of our
[SPEAKER_01]: history with slavery and institutionalized
racism and racist policy, we have what's
[SPEAKER_01]: called an equity program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might hear us talking about it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did was we put people of color and
people from communities that were most
[SPEAKER_01]: highly policed by the war on drugs and by
police first in line to get licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In New Jersey, they have really unique
structures where they're actually getting
[SPEAKER_01]: business training.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting good loans, good rates on
loans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting deals on rent,
things that are really barriers to entry
[SPEAKER_01]: to acknowledge that they have 400 years of
being treated like sub-human beings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they deserve a step up because many of
their communities have been destroyed by
[SPEAKER_01]: the war on drugs, not only from policing,
but from the fact that most black fathers
[SPEAKER_01]: in urban centers are in prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all black children that are now
being raised in the hood without any
[SPEAKER_01]: support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the war on drugs has incredible
implications that do mess with the
[SPEAKER_01]: economy, that do destabilize spaces and
make cities unsafe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the things that we try to
talk about to these MSOs or to Joe
[SPEAKER_01]: Corporation that don't know why it's
important to care about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That if you don't actively have in your
marketing, in your budget, in your
[SPEAKER_01]: community and in your staffing an
acknowledgement of the underlying racism
[SPEAKER_01]: and the underlying sexism and greed
capitalism that has pushed us to where we
[SPEAKER_01]: are now, you actually won't do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't really worked to be unabashedly
greedy in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't like it as consumers,
as B2B.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, the world is moving
towards more conscious capitalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to be on the right side of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally buy into social equity and
equity programs and that being a critical
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the reality is very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality and implementation of it is
exceptionally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We messed it up, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't do a good job at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also for a company who is trying
to operate within the business and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the challenges of running a business day
to day, with the additional tasks of
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting a membership and that
membership just a constant pushing a hill
[SPEAKER_00]: or pushing a rock up the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been scarred by what is a David
versus Goliath task of not only pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis forward in the US, but doing so
with so many vested parties who want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see cannabis ultimately fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you convince companies to really
embrace that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your message for them?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in the US we've evolved over time
where there isn't the bogeyman of big
[SPEAKER_02]: pharma and tobacco really actively
lobbying against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say that they don't have interests
that are in opposition to ours,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not a priority.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem that we have is that the
industry itself, especially the small
[SPEAKER_02]: operators, are not investing in the policy
reforms that are needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's really important is, and to Joe's
point, is that we can make this look
[SPEAKER_02]: really bad by having one or two of the
largest companies push through national
[SPEAKER_02]: reforms that are favorable to them and no
one else.
[SPEAKER_02]: The message that we have out there is that
there is an alternative to that,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is making sure that the small
businesses have a voice, making sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're creating a policy landscape that
raises all ships and ensures that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: an open and inclusive market.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do as an association,
is represent those small businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're going to see big pharma and
alcohol and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already playing in this space,
but there's room for craft cannabis as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's not as much oppositional.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they seek to co-opt it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there certainly is
investments from big pharma and big
[SPEAKER_03]: tobacco into cannabis, just not in a way
that is conducive to having a healthy
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry and in a way that's
beneficial to consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is with the sole focus of driving
revenues to shareholders and not
[SPEAKER_03]: ideologically aligned with this plant that
is beneficial and helps people
[SPEAKER_03]: therapeutically and should not be
criminalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think to your earlier question,
the war on drugs is an awful thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent a lot of my career in the
trenches, combating the war on drugs case
[SPEAKER_03]: by case, and I've seen how bad it is on
families and communities firsthand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Legalization of cannabis does not fix
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What Luna was describing was that we had
decided, starting in California but
[SPEAKER_03]: exported to other states in the US,
to try to rectify the harms of the war on
[SPEAKER_03]: drugs by providing preferential treatment
to applicants in local municipal
[SPEAKER_03]: permitting.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reality, which you would think is
obvious but is lost upon many cities and
[SPEAKER_03]: counties and states, is that giving
someone beneficial treatment in a
[SPEAKER_03]: permitting process does not correct the
generational harms to society of the war
[SPEAKER_03]: on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Running a compliant business, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have a very strong social
equity mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody is in cannabis for
the wrong reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I disagree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of people in there
for the wrong reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of us love the plant,
but there's some snakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you realize you actually have to work
hard, it scares a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get over that shock of,
okay, this isn't going to be easy,
[SPEAKER_00]: the true green people come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a case of you're in the industry
because you think this is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: can change the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the solutions to
absolutely everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one puts money behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To Aaron's point, if you're being
regulated to death, why would you spend
[SPEAKER_01]: $10,000 a year to have them lobby for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the self-fulfilling prophecy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one has the money to lobby,
and we don't have money because we have
[SPEAKER_01]: bad policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, but you've got federal policy,
which is one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any policy that you have seen
that has enhanced or certainly been more
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable to find somewhat of the balance?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people sitting here last
year were licking their lips on the
[SPEAKER_00]: thought of adult-use cannabis in Germany,
only to see it being more watered down
[SPEAKER_00]: than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to happen time and time
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, as everybody says, this is a
marathon, not a sprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are policies that are being
designed in certain states that are
[SPEAKER_00]: finding or trying to find that balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one has done it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that I can look at globally,
every jurisdiction that has sought out
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization has done a lot of things
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would invert that and say that there are
bright spots in different areas where we
[SPEAKER_03]: should replicate certain elements of
policy and deploy those and Frankenstein
[SPEAKER_03]: it in other areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam is the thought leader on this
issue going back to the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot wrong with how the
Netherlands, and I say Amsterdam because
[SPEAKER_03]: in large part, more broadly in the
Netherlands, cannabis is not as well
[SPEAKER_03]: tolerated as it is in Amsterdam,
especially more recently with the
[SPEAKER_03]: government there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the point being, the social
consumption aspect of coffee shops and
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to go to a business and consume
cannabis and hang out is something that is
[SPEAKER_03]: special and unique and is not replicated
in most other places.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look in the U.S., by and large,
the model is an off-sale model like what
[SPEAKER_03]: you would get going to a liquor store.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go and buy your product and you take
it home and consume it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not adequate for society to
destigmatize this product.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, what they do poorly in the
Netherlands is that the supply chain is
[SPEAKER_03]: not legalized or regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you have this illicit supply chain
that feeds into a quasi-legal model and it
[SPEAKER_03]: can never really become mature and it's
just stymied.
[SPEAKER_03]: As it has been for the last 50 years or
so.
[SPEAKER_03]: In California, one of the things that we
did there that I don't know whether or not
[SPEAKER_03]: it can be successful is we did not limit
the supply side, the production side.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no limitation by the state of
California for how many cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses there can be or not be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ideologically, I thought out of the gate,
that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's allow business to do what business
does.
[SPEAKER_03]: The better businesses will out-compete the
worst businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through this process, like what we see
with other industries, we will see the
[SPEAKER_03]: good businesses rise to the top and they
will get the market dominance.
[SPEAKER_03]: What has happened is that we've had a
massive oversupply problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have created a system there
where we allow for some municipalities to
[SPEAKER_03]: legalize and others to prohibit,
in California still, several years after
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization, more than 65% of the state
of California does not allow for legal
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, for commercial cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then what you have is this massive
oversupply that gets funneled into the
[SPEAKER_03]: retailer where there's just not enough
retail availability for consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consumers go to the illicit market,
they go back to their dealer and amongst
[SPEAKER_03]: other things, that local dealer,
the person that they 've known,
[SPEAKER_03]: that living room they've gone to,
whatever, they don't pay huge taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have all those added expenses,
which makes the legal cannabis businesses,
[SPEAKER_03]: ironically, less competitive than the
legacy folks that never bothered with
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization to begin with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's complicated, but what I would say is
that you can look at some things about how
[SPEAKER_03]: California has done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can look at some things about how
Canada has done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that Canada has done
well is federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: For all of the problems with Canada,
of which there are many.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that the industry there has
largely been a failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least there's federal legalization and
you can import, export in and out of
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada and you can have access to banking.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something that is special.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we look at this Frankenstein approach,
we could imagine a model where there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: federal level of legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is the ability for the consumer to
go to a place and consume.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some guardrails in the supply
chain to ensure both that there is not
[SPEAKER_03]: fully an oversupply, which I think that
there's some larger debate there that we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have time for now, while ensuring
that the point of access for the consumers
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't so unduly restricted that people are
basically compelled to go to illicit
[SPEAKER_03]: market in order to have access to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like in Australia where I've heard that
if you get caught driving, with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in your system, they can take your license
and it puts the license of the prescribing
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's also the implementation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The devil's in the details a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I want people to realize too as
we're talking about this, the word
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're either talking about
decriminalization or tax control and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when in California they thought
they were legalizing or then they voted
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, they thought they were
decriminalizing it for possession,
[SPEAKER_01]: use, transport, cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we were actually voting for was the
consumer packaged goods model that was
[SPEAKER_01]: sold through license dispensaries through
the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two things happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got Portugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uruguay is a really interesting example.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, are we talking about is
it good for business or is it good for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and medicine and medical sovereignty
and human rights?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they're at odds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose this has to be a universal
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting close to 80 countries around
the world with some sort of legal
[SPEAKER_00]: framework for access to cannabis,
predominantly medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not including the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day there's a fresh wave of optimism
for federal legalization only to be jammed
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the can.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be a major domino to fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be the EU because
they're not prepared to rule on something
[SPEAKER_00]: so significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's highly unlikely to be the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially going to be a mishmash of
federal policies or international policies
[SPEAKER_00]: for each jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any kind of or suspect any
change within the federal system for the
[SPEAKER_00]: next five years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the global domino.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the US, all of the action has been at
the state level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd argue there's been some positive to
that is that it probably has kept the big
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco, big pharma at bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that in terms of seeing full
regulation and control like alcohol at the
[SPEAKER_02]: federal level in the United States,
that's still more than five years out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's five or 10 years out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of factors on who's elected
next and a lot of factors that are in play
[SPEAKER_02]: to make that prediction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think what we will see in the
near term will be what is called US law
[SPEAKER_02]: rescheduling of cannabis, kind of a
medicalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll provide some relief for the industry
on some levels, but comes with a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: other host of regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would not affect international trade in
any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of our industry will still be out of
compliance with federal law for quite some
[SPEAKER_02]: time, but that's probably going to be the
next big move short of other in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: larger policy reform nationally in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing people really relooking at
their license caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we've seen that limited
licensing is a real problem to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: we just heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this is one of the most
important things is letting business do
[SPEAKER_01]: what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of that is allowing not
bottlenecking.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest thing is we were the
consultants for the city and the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were trying to push these things
through in Oakland, they didn't know their
[SPEAKER_01]: own laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to tell them how business work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just talking in the green room
about a lot of these policymakers and
[SPEAKER_01]: legislators, they don't have experience in
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand what an
implementation of a business plan,
[SPEAKER_01]: what shareholders like the pressures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what the devil ends up
being in the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being at the table, knowing who these
people are is what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on a first name basis with all of my
city council members, my district
[SPEAKER_01]: representatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew me, they knew my crew,
they knew our argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: We showed up, we did cleanups in the
community to show that cannabis was giving
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We donated in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were giving money to the libraries and
the schools way before we legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was pre-tax control regulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the cops would have an issue or we
would have someone break in, the school
[SPEAKER_01]: teachers and the librarians would show up
at the city council and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, these people are contributing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would show up for us and fight for
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's a little bit of
making sure that you know who these people
[SPEAKER_01]: are, that they know you.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Brazil, you will go to a judge and ask
their permission to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine the societal change when the judge
class, which skews typically more wealthy,
[SPEAKER_01]: more educated, more elite, are hearing
hundreds of testimonials a day about why
[SPEAKER_01]: someone needs their medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the thing that's going to change
hearts and minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be in the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be in the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't quantify magic and you can't
quantify community building and what this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's the most important
thing is we're not loud enough as
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers, as business people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not working hard enough on the
policy side because we're so busy with our
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging, our branding, our social media
content, our personal laundry and
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships if we have a life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to put a lot more effort
and energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I noticed in California is when we
were at the city council meetings,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just business owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: There weren't many consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There weren't many other people arguing.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a policymaker, if you see business
people arguing for themselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just imagine that they're greedy and
they just want what they want in their own
[SPEAKER_01]: business interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't realize, we want the movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want medical safe access and
recreational access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are you talking to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they know you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you at the table to tell them how you
want it done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because trying to undo and fix bad policy
is way harder, more stressful,
[SPEAKER_01]: more expensive than baking it into the DNA
from day one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a saying, either you're at the
table or you're on the menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Facts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing parallel things to all the
things that you just described.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sitting here all these years later today,
it didn't make a damn bit of difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: The businesses that were there that were
champions that time, they're gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why they're gone and they don't
exist and why it didn't matter is because
[SPEAKER_03]: there's overtax regulation amongst other
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that I think if we have
a takeaway to impart on the people here
[SPEAKER_03]: and on policymakers in Germany and other
places, it's to not look at cannabis as
[SPEAKER_03]: being a cash cow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis, it's not going to solve a
budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't be overtaxed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't look at cannabis as providing any
more revenue than any other business and
[SPEAKER_03]: any other industry in any other place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to fix these larger
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to fix the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to fix larger epistemic
things that have larger epistemic
[SPEAKER_03]: problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: What it is, is it's an opportunity to end
in abysmal and immoral policy of what we
[SPEAKER_03]: call the war on drugs, to incarcerate
people for a beneficial plant that helps
[SPEAKER_03]: them and doesn't hurt anyone, that's never
killed anyone ever in the history of
[SPEAKER_03]: humanity, has never caused a single death.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all we're looking to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking to just fix that wrong and
allow businesses to succeed and to allow
[SPEAKER_03]: people to use it and to use it fairly and
reasonably freely and the model that I
[SPEAKER_03]: think if we're looking at it, one of the
things that we haven't talked a lot about
[SPEAKER_03]: is the beverage model.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I think is going to work the best for
cannabis is essentially what we see
[SPEAKER_03]: working for wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of parallels there and in
your home country when you think about how
[SPEAKER_03]: is wine regulated?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can I access it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much does it cost?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's required in order to get into the
business?
[SPEAKER_03]: Extrapolate that into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a way to do that and I think that
just in how we're having this conversation
[SPEAKER_03]: and we've been in the trenches since the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of battle scars here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been through it all and it can be
absolutely awful and we can tell you a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: more of what not to do than what to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do what we did in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do what we do in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do what has been done in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first model for legalization in
Germany was shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was going to lead to monopoly and it's
not a bad thing that that didn't pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there is just an opportunity
here for re-examination of a fundamental
[SPEAKER_03]: policy issue and to think about what can
we do in order to make businesses
[SPEAKER_03]: successful to give some benefit to
communities and allow for safe access.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are really the only things that are
going to be accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if we accomplish those alone,
that's still something pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it comes down to judging,
well, what is winning the war on drugs and
[SPEAKER_00]: what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think if people want everything,
it's not achievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that wraps it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for your insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everyone for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stefan Murthy, Aaron Smith, Luna Stoehrer,
and Joe Rogelay.
Thank you.
