[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to our next panel, we have one,
two, three panels left.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, it goes fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Time flies when you're having weed,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_06]: To discuss the cannabis cultivation
technology revolution, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cutting edge technology that is elevating
global cultivation operations.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm this many years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how old you guys are,
but I'm this many.
[SPEAKER_06]: To lead us off, the managing partner for
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it for Sonny Moorenhout.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy to be here and having actually four
great guys with me in the panel to deep
[SPEAKER_08]: dive into cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we had a lot of panels today,
but I like this one the most, diving into
[SPEAKER_08]: the cultivation technology.
[SPEAKER_08]: Discussing the latest innovations.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do we see at growing facilities?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think let's first start a quick
introduction round.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mikael, the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Mikael Seagal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the president of TSR Grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are an advanced LED lighting company
powered by smart power, where we integrate
[SPEAKER_03]: power sensors and other technologies into
to really do some crop steering through
[SPEAKER_03]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're excited at this show specifically
for Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: We introduced an integrated Grow container
solution that has everything integrated
[SPEAKER_03]: together that we can bring to the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Franz.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am the horticulture service specialist
for Fluence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fluence is an LED company from Austin,
Texas, working in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_05]: the last 12 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me personally, working for over 15 years
in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And growing as well for a little bit
longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, happy to be here and participate
on the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Perry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the business development team at
Grower IQ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really excited to be here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really excited to be on the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Grower IQ, if you haven't heard
of it, a Canadian based software company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were founded in 2017 in Toronto,
and since then we've expanded to about 19
[SPEAKER_02]: or 20 countries around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, looking forward to moving into
Germany as things open up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Jeremy from Fos LEDs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm one of the horticulture specialists.
[SPEAKER_04]: We help service the customers on the
transition over to LEDs as well as along
[SPEAKER_04]: the way to ensure your success.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also am one of the international
commercial sales team members.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're happy to be here at ICBC in
Berlin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, great to have you guys here over
stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe introduce myself shortly.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm born in the Netherlands, actually in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: My parents are in a greenhouse in the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all my life in the growing business.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm one of the managing partners of
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we do is we are really the
partner of a grower all the way from
[SPEAKER_08]: business ID, support and design,
and then also execution commissioning and
[SPEAKER_08]: supporting them in all the growing
facilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: So taking this to the topic of the panel,
maybe starting with you, Frans.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the latest cultivation
techniques, innovations you've seen at
[SPEAKER_08]: customers you've visited?
[SPEAKER_08]: What are some highlights you want to show
to everybody here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, difficult word to start
since, you know, I started cultivating.
[SPEAKER_05]: We obviously went with the metal
highlights.
[SPEAKER_05]: For veg and then with the HPS for flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say now for over the last six,
seven years, we see very advanced LED
[SPEAKER_05]: technology where we can ramp up with more
light intensity, get more yield per square
[SPEAKER_05]: meter.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the latest years, what we see is the
under or ICL, you know, inter canopy
[SPEAKER_05]: lighting, shifting light intensities from
100% top light to 75% top light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or even down to 60% top light and 40%
lighting in between the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's coming from commercial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have tested it and it's all over
the internet at the moment with other
[SPEAKER_05]: companies also getting into that space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we see a lot of benefits in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shifting especially the different grades,
ABC to only A grade or having very few B
[SPEAKER_05]: grade.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's very valuable for the
pharmaceutical market.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jeremy, what you have seen other than
light as innovations in the growing
[SPEAKER_08]: facilities, what are some key things you
think, okay, my growers really need to
[SPEAKER_08]: have this in the facility?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing a lot more sensor integration
and ways to collect data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if we don't know what's going on
inside of our media substrate,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever it is, then obviously we don't
know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We only can take guesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only a guessing game.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with all the advancements in
technology in the, as far as on site
[SPEAKER_04]: testing or water content, you know,
water meter, water analysis, crop
[SPEAKER_04]: steering, there's so many different ways
to kind of break that one down and get
[SPEAKER_04]: into that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really, really long, big,
it's a fun subject.
[SPEAKER_04]: So data, data collection, SAP analysis is
another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we need to know what's going on
inside of our plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't just guess it's like doing blood
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to know what's happening at all
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't just look at pictures because we
have these books, sorry, we have these
[SPEAKER_04]: books, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it gives you 15 different
possibilities for what could be going
[SPEAKER_04]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a cow mag problem?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a nitrogen issue?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's some pictures you cannot see it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to dive into the subject,
but yeah, data collection that connects
[SPEAKER_08]: really well to what you are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more about data
selection or data focus and gathering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think that's a huge topic and a
huge focus right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember at the beginning of,
you know, legalization, the medical market
[SPEAKER_02]: in Canada, I mean, you know, you could,
I mean, you could put up four walls and
[SPEAKER_02]: throw a bunch of seeds on the ground like
Jack and the Beanstalk and weed would grow
[SPEAKER_02]: and you could sell it at a high price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, everyone made a fortune.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but the market has become more
competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, lots of entrants, you know,
for people here who have watched the
[SPEAKER_02]: Canadian market, a lot of people have been
exiting it less now, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: over the past couple of years,
we saw a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So discussions now are a lot around
margins and, you know, efficiency of
[SPEAKER_02]: effort and, you know, parsimony when it
comes to expending resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need really data to make those
decisions to understand that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: focusing your resources in the right place
and you're doing it efficiently and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the most bang for every dollar
that you're putting in because it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it has in certain jurisdictions,
it does become a very competitive industry
[SPEAKER_02]: and you need to focus.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for you, Michael, what have you seen
around the latest year in new innovations
[SPEAKER_08]: and cultivation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, look, you know, cannabis is
a, it's a medical, it's medicine,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's food, it's a high value crop,
and it's also extremely important to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: it consistently and repeatedly from grow
to grow and every time you grow that
[SPEAKER_03]: strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we see the move towards really master
recipes and taking master recipes,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that includes not only, you know,
the energy that you're delivering to the
[SPEAKER_03]: lights for the strain that you're growing,
but then also ensuring that the
[SPEAKER_03]: environment is identical to what you did
last time and marrying that to the,
[SPEAKER_03]: to the fertigation and the recipe that's
driven in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as you look to drive really master
recipes, you want to be able to set up and
[SPEAKER_03]: develop a facility or an application where
you can, you can input and when you set up
[SPEAKER_03]: the room, you set up the strain,
you set up what you're doing, you're
[SPEAKER_03]: delivering exactly repeatedly the same
exact recipe and information and direction
[SPEAKER_03]: to the equipment and the process that's
being grown so that the outcome is
[SPEAKER_03]: repeatable to the last time you grew that
strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then through analytics, you're able to
analyze that and do comparative,
[SPEAKER_03]: not only testing, but comparative
analytics to see where things could be
[SPEAKER_03]: improved as you continue to improve that
master recipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's an important point,
irrigation, fertigation, and following
[SPEAKER_08]: what's happening in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_08]: And based on that, making informed
decisions how to adapt your strategy also
[SPEAKER_08]: with the type of light or how much light
you have, you really need to adapt that,
[SPEAKER_08]: of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: That brings me also to a topic you guys
brought up to talk about is advancements
[SPEAKER_08]: in irrigation and fertigation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jeremy, what are the core things you're
looking at?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mainly, I mean, again, back to the data
collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and now tongue twister and actually the
pulse feeding and accuracy of the nutrient
[SPEAKER_04]: delivery to the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big deal because when you start
talking about direct injection systems,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of them kind of just, they're not
that depending on the kind of parasitic,
[SPEAKER_04]: the quality of pump, or I don't want to go
down a rabbit hole, but when you have
[SPEAKER_04]: venturis, for instance, it can tend to be
a little bit less accurate most of the
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many machines.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are many.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need to have to say one specific,
but you understand what I mean.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need pressure compensated drippers and
also checking it.
[SPEAKER_08]: With your water bottles from Friday night,
checking do we get out of every dripper
[SPEAKER_08]: the same amount of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very important to understand
there are those two terms, vegetative
[SPEAKER_05]: steering, generative steering around.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the end, it's about the dry bags,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the irrigation, the frequency of the
irrigation, understanding what your root
[SPEAKER_05]: zone and your plants need, and then you
will be able to steer it in the right
[SPEAKER_05]: ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, on that behalf, you need to
have the right equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see irrigations on rock wool up to 12
times per day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually how it should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe even more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it gets too dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's also, that fits in perfect with
those high light intensity approaches that
[SPEAKER_05]: we see now or the photo acclimation,
as we like to call it, where we ramp up
[SPEAKER_05]: the light intensity, obviously getting the
plant used to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Step by step, day by day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the end, we can really,
we see results.
[SPEAKER_05]: One kilogram per square meter is
definitely possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Under one fixture, that's 1.2 times 1.2,
you get up to 1.5 kg.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's literally when you have all the
correlations in check.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most importantly, lighting,
fertigation, and the rest is defined too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about nano bubbles?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's another big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting to get involved,
we're starting to see a lot more dissolved
[SPEAKER_04]: oxygen implemented into the cultivations
and even some water treatment with ozone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plasma technology is another new one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_08]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nano bubbles is maybe a great example.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something which is necessary if you
have like a low quality substrate,
[SPEAKER_08]: and your oxygen levels are low,
but I hear you talking about growing in
[SPEAKER_08]: rock wool, stone wool.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have good water temperature,
you will never have issues with oxygen
[SPEAKER_08]: level.
[SPEAKER_08]: So is then nano bubbles necessary?
[SPEAKER_08]: That is then the question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, depending on your starting
quality water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_04]: In our greenhouse in North Las Vegas that
I manage, we have never had chillers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had a really bad fissarium outbreak.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once we implemented dissolved oxygen,
not only did our algae problems go away,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we managed to increase the,
well, obviously the yield, but the
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient uptake, the metabolism of the
plants obviously are increasing,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the overall ORP is dropping too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your system's going to be a lot
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the key thing from that, that's where
I was going with that, I went off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of our water was getting up to like
90 degrees Celsius, which is a lot higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: 90 degrees, and we still weren't losing
plants because of the high oxygen content.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's some cool benefits that come
along with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think all those technologies,
and I think it just comes back to also
[SPEAKER_03]: knowing what's there and really
monitoring.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it comes back to data,
and if you see all the different
[SPEAKER_03]: interactions of all those things,
and not the, you know, AI and all these
[SPEAKER_03]: things people talking about, but these are
the things that if the data is collected,
[SPEAKER_03]: then at some point you can start to
analyze that and really assess what's
[SPEAKER_03]: happening and better in real time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that, you know, there's a lot
of advancements there that's coming,
[SPEAKER_03]: but data is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Data is key.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your outputs are a direct result of your
inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can monitor all that and map it
and go back and reflect on it and see the
[SPEAKER_04]: charts or where your issues started,
it's definitely a big advantage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, everything needs to be in balance
for optimal plant growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's dive into another hot topic,
actually, energy conservation.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we look to the global situation,
energy prices, it's a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are strategies to maximize yields
while actually without compromising the
[SPEAKER_08]: growing operations, but getting,
yeah, needing less energy for your growing
[SPEAKER_08]: facility?
[SPEAKER_08]: As an example, with the research institute
that you're also involved with,
[SPEAKER_08]: Frans, we, looking into a crop,
growing a cannabis crop without any vetch
[SPEAKER_08]: period, that can really reduce your energy
consumption by 40, 50% easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a very short note on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Austria, where many people grow a lot
wheat at home also, we don't really have
[SPEAKER_05]: time to spend vetch, you know,
and one week of vetch is one and a half
[SPEAKER_05]: weeks of flowering time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes I look at some growers and
they tell me it's like four weeks of
[SPEAKER_05]: vetch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, yeah, I see those humongous
trees that you have, but bro, that's six
[SPEAKER_05]: weeks of flowering, you know, if you're
having your profits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So long story short, it comes from a
necessity, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: To have no vetch, obviously need to
increase the plant density per square
[SPEAKER_05]: meter, ramp up light intensity,
gotta be fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's, it's, you need to
understand the correlations, but then you
[SPEAKER_05]: can save time, get more yield.
[SPEAKER_08]: And having the right genetic can cope with
it, of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do that with stumpy small indicas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do that with stretchy hybrids that fill up
your canopy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, going to what you're doing with Grow
IQ, is that the energy topic?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something coming back to you guys
as well, what you're doing and developing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to some extent, probably not as much
as some of the other people on the panel,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it does come back to, yeah,
gathering data, understanding the data,
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding what's happened to the
history of your batches and plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we do some forecasting in Grow IQ
of what yield will look like under certain
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once we have some historical data on
what's gone into these batches,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can get really close to what a dry
yield will be, you know, at the end of a
[SPEAKER_02]: batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, different factors that go
in will... But you say forecasting yield,
[SPEAKER_08]: but do you also have models already to
forecast the energy usage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that gets associated, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, you can play around a
little bit with what the inputs are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and try to lower that energy
input and see what your yield forecast
[SPEAKER_02]: will be in the future, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, in a roundabout way,
it does get to it, because then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: minimize some of your inputs to maximize
some of your outputs, stretch it out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Michael?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so power and energy is something
that happened to know a little bit about,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's primarily with what we do with
smart power.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really being intentional about
what energy you use specifically for the
[SPEAKER_03]: crop you're being grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by being able to use, you know,
smart power, distributed power outside
[SPEAKER_03]: of...outside of your...centralized in your
facility, you can deliver the exact energy
[SPEAKER_03]: to the specific, you know, light or that's
being over the specific strain that's
[SPEAKER_03]: being grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And through that, you can start to bring
really crop steering through lighting to
[SPEAKER_03]: match your fertigation and start to even
save another 20% in energy just by being
[SPEAKER_03]: optimizing in exactly the amount of energy
that you're delivering to that fixture
[SPEAKER_03]: that's over that strain that's in that
particular room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you couple that with,
you know, saving on the veg time and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, energy in Europe and around
the world is huge, and being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: monitor that and then understand exactly
how much energy you're going to use in a
[SPEAKER_03]: particular...in a particular cycle can
save significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that you can start to do
with smart energy and smart power is you
[SPEAKER_03]: can start to analyze and get feedback from
the grid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there are, you know, rolling
backouts or other things that are
[SPEAKER_03]: happening or, you know, peak demand,
you can actually shave even if it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple percent down.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can save significant energy by,
you know, penalties from being in plump
[SPEAKER_03]: implemented and without affecting what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you talk about growing medicinal
cannabis in general, everybody really
[SPEAKER_08]: talks about consistency, uniformity of the
end product you need to have.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is, for you guys, some key elements
in the cultivation will really have a big
[SPEAKER_08]: role in getting consistency and uniformity
generally?
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I think a good control system,
you know, that's a difficult thing to find
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes to make every thing line up
together, especially when you piece some
[SPEAKER_04]: of these pieces...especially when you
bring some of these elements together,
[SPEAKER_04]: you might not have the same fertigation
skid as, you know, the same manufacturer
[SPEAKER_04]: as the HVAC, you know, or cooling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, for instance, you might
have a preva system or a horta...what do
[SPEAKER_04]: we say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Preva or whatever, any of the argus,
and you might want to choose a different
[SPEAKER_04]: fertigation skid from a different company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a big, big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have control of all of your
inputs, again, it's going to be a lesser
[SPEAKER_04]: result of your outputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to be able to maximize your
grams per square foot or per meter,
[SPEAKER_04]: however you're looking at it, whatever
country you're in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we try and focus on a lot of
uniformity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And uniformity is going to deliver your
most grams per square meter.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of the day, a gram...I
mean, a watt's a watt, and a BTU is a BTU.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you maximize your yield,
that's going to really balance that out at
[SPEAKER_04]: the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing, because it seems like we're a
very tech panel, it always comes down to
[SPEAKER_05]: the person that's heading your grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So humans don't get lost in the sauce.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still about us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also AI.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, in the end, we all need to track
and trace and also have the data
[SPEAKER_05]: collected, become better.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the medical cannabis industry,
it's called cultivar validation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We validate the strain, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: In the best case, you have a knowledgeable
grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: He understands the strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: He understands the lineage, the genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he more or less knows how to grow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So within three grows where he's within
the plus minus 10%, he will understand how
[SPEAKER_05]: to cultivate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's key, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always down to the persons.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a funny thing what you were
mentioning also with the growing and
[SPEAKER_08]: influence on the final product,
uniformity.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is then also important, have the
right lab to test it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lately, I was with a grower and they were
scared that they were not doing it right
[SPEAKER_08]: because they suddenly had a couple percent
less THC in the flour.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said, yeah, cultivation,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the end, I said, yeah, please
recheck with the lab if the testing is
[SPEAKER_08]: done correctly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And where was the mistake?
[SPEAKER_08]: In there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can also be validated wrong,
the testing methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting standardized is a really big thing
that we need to try and band together on a
[SPEAKER_04]: global network.
[SPEAKER_08]: That actually brings you also to Europe,
how you're connecting lab testing to what
[SPEAKER_08]: you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it comes down to, as you were saying
earlier, tracking and data and being able
[SPEAKER_02]: to record what the finished result is in
your COAs that you're getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being able to go back and even with
the same grower who's managing the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, there's often a big team and
the grower is going through dozens of
[SPEAKER_02]: batches and time goes by, they're busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes people have a great yield and
the next one is a little off and with good
[SPEAKER_02]: tracking, they can go back and see,
I added an extra this that time and got a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit better of a yield out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to just add that we talk about
all the important things of data and
[SPEAKER_03]: tracking and testing and these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we see a lot too that the design of
the facility from the beginning is also
[SPEAKER_03]: critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so many times, it's a rush to build
and a rush to get started.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I'll worry about those
things later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, you will save so much time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And countless times, we talk to growers
that their first build, they're just
[SPEAKER_03]: ripping it down and starting over and
redoing it or abandoning different
[SPEAKER_03]: sections.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really plan your design.
[SPEAKER_03]: Design the facility, look at all of the
systems, make sure they can integrate
[SPEAKER_03]: together, regardless of what you're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: But from the fertigation to the lighting
to the sensors, everything is integrated
[SPEAKER_03]: and can deliver the crop and plan what you
want to grow and how you want to grow and
[SPEAKER_03]: really the output that you need and plan
that through so that when you start to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow, you can meet and achieve that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that a lot of times is we all want to
get to the output.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you talk about medical and
repeatability, it's having that integrated
[SPEAKER_03]: and that design really thought through
upfront that's going to give you the
[SPEAKER_03]: outcome you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consistency.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that's a really important
topic, design of the facility and do it in
[SPEAKER_08]: the right way.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that you're also ready for the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: That actually brings me also to another
topic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm asking you guys, what will be for you
the growing facility of the future?
[SPEAKER_08]: How would it look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm building the growing facility of the
future right now, fortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my dream grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got really lucky and we're building one
in Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a biochar facility, so it will be
carbon negative.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're taking the waste from sugar cane
and we're turning it into biochar and
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to generate 110 megawatts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need all that power, so we'll
sell it back to the grid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll be cultivating
aeroponically as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to be pretty clean and we
won't be carbon negative on the
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation side, but we'll be carbon
neutral and carbon negative on the power
[SPEAKER_04]: generation side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of a cool one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's new.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's really hard to get free power
and clean power into our cultivations.
[SPEAKER_04]: It usually takes so much by the time it
gets to us and it's not that clean or
[SPEAKER_04]: green.
[SPEAKER_08]: Globally, there are more projects in the
vegetable industry where they're connected
[SPEAKER_08]: to things like you were just mentioning.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not completely new, but the
cannabis is not seen often.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just a dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool to connect all the dots together
and to be able to bring it into the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis world and give back to the
environment at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Such designs, Jeremy, are definitely the
future.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see that also in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a customer that's CO2 neutral.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have their own, the first floating
solar on the dam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very nice futuristic designs
basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me personally, my personal opinion,
I would like to see medical cannabis being
[SPEAKER_05]: grown controlled indoors, because I'm also
an asthma patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I smoke cannabis from a greenhouse,
I'll be coughing and not sleeping the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole night.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for me, it definitely needs to be super
clean, and I would like it to be craft
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we have all smoked cannabis
from a greenhouse or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does the job.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the pharmaceutical part,
there's more to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, for extracts, I think we could
go greenhouse and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, from a technology point of view,
I think light deliver light also in
[SPEAKER_05]: between the plants, really apply more
efficient the technologies, also
[SPEAKER_05]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some mediums, rock wall
alternatives that hold water for a longer
[SPEAKER_05]: time, maybe more sustainable in the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's see what the future holds.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know where COMEC is heading or COMEC
wins.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, I mean, those are good
points.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say I'd throw AI on top of that as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's moving pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does some amazing stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're just really at the tip
of the iceberg in terms of how we're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to incorporate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're playing around.
[SPEAKER_02]: We recently released a module actually
that incorporates, I presented to a few
[SPEAKER_02]: quality people, and some of them loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple were worried about their role,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in reality, I think it's something
that will enhance it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, it's just pushing out to
cover functional issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And an example is you can train the AI on
your internal facility company SOPs so
[SPEAKER_02]: that lay people can go in and they can
say, oh, what do I do after I put StemRoot
[SPEAKER_02]: on the clone?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll come back and give you a lay
person's answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next step, it also puts training programs
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually have courses
presented by video AI.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, it eliminates the entire need
for someone to put SOP training courses
[SPEAKER_02]: together and deliver them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all done digitally, which is a huge
productivity and savings for a facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, that's, again, the tip of the
iceberg.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many functional areas that
can be addressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next step after that becomes
more the decision-making capacity that can
[SPEAKER_02]: be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's gonna be a lot of
exciting stuff around that in the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll see how that continues,
what can be incorporated easily regarding
[SPEAKER_08]: AI into cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe let's go to the audience and see if
there are some cultivation questions for
[SPEAKER_08]: the panel members here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There he is, there he is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there cultivation questions for the
audience here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like not many.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks like you've explained it all so very
well to them that they're completely,
[SPEAKER_06]: fully educated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe no growers here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they had a bunch of edibles at lunch
and they just kicked in.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I'd say is to add to the
conversation is when you look at,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the candidates in the cannabis
industry, there's a lot of excitement and
[SPEAKER_03]: many times trying to invent things from
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the whole cultivation and the
whole industry can make a difference in
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about the future of cultivation
and facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we look to the left and to the
right, there's a lot of industries that
[SPEAKER_03]: are extremely efficient and using a lot of
technology, whether it's in other crops or
[SPEAKER_03]: other manufacturing sectors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are significant technologies
that could easily be adopted and
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially have a lot of applicability to
not only manufacturing, but cultivation,
[SPEAKER_03]: energy and power especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's significant global factories that
are carbon neutral, CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you talk about smart power and really
delivering and living on the grid and just
[SPEAKER_03]: being really integrated in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think there's a lot of sectors that
sometimes we close our eyes, but if we
[SPEAKER_03]: look to the left and right, there's a lot
of technology in other industries that can
[SPEAKER_03]: really help the cultivation facility of
the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a microphone up here behind you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is actually related to that
because we all talk about technology and
[SPEAKER_01]: growing cultivation integration and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that I foresee is that at
this point, one of the struggles that I
[SPEAKER_01]: see is most of that technology depends on
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like your perspective on the
fact that, for example, Germany currently
[SPEAKER_01]: is discussing a type of model that is very
low scale, small scale compared to the
[SPEAKER_01]: technology that we are talking about that
often depend on big scales to actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: balanced out on price, cost, efficiency
and whatnot that you guys were discussing.
[SPEAKER_01]: My concern on that is also on what is your
view because European Union is looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: this example and many of these examples on
how to move forward and the scale matters
[SPEAKER_01]: in all of this, in all other horticulture
size matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like your perspective on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see this being integrated in
smaller scales?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll jump in just because, you know,
we're looking at that same model,
[SPEAKER_03]: but with our, you know, harvest pro
container systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we look at it as a modularity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while there is scale to it,
I think if you break on any thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you can break down the systems and,
you know, the application and what's being
[SPEAKER_03]: done and take things and modularize it,
then you can easily scale it from,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, whether it's a container to a
room to multiple rooms to a facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe there are limits to some of the
large scale, you know, technology and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, power plants that might come
into the conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think if you're able to look at
technology and really modularize the
[SPEAKER_03]: systems and application of what you're
doing, then you can slim it down and also
[SPEAKER_03]: expand it out with great success.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say there's probably a business case
for all these different technologies that
[SPEAKER_02]: can be looked at in the context of
different scale, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them will make sense and some
of them might not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the case of a small operation,
sometimes it even makes more sense to
[SPEAKER_02]: implement certain types of technology just
because the percentage savings you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting out of it is so much higher,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can run a facility off of three
people versus five, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage-wise, that's a lot of labor
savings that you can approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it comes down to the type of
technology in the business case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as people were saying,
you know, adjusting, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe putting together an offering
that's appropriate for that size and
[SPEAKER_02]: scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it was a really good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we see or what I see is now in the
planning of social clubs, it gets very
[SPEAKER_05]: difficult with the sizing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably what you were referring to
of machinery like HVAC.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in regards to lighting,
it's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can sell you one fixture or thousands.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it gets very difficult regarding
HVAC, for example.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have discussions with social club guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to go full capacity,
500 members.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do the calculations for them,
introduce them to the HVAC company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the HVAC company says, well,
it's going to be about 500,000 for the
[SPEAKER_05]: HVAC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, ah, because they don't
want to do project business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the politics are not set up for
correct business in Germany at the moment,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I find drastic because cannabis has
deserved way better laws where a real
[SPEAKER_05]: industry can flourish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, long story short, I have no answer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think it will be really connected
to the growing system, the way how you
[SPEAKER_08]: grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: That should be connected.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's small scale, then you should look
at all the plant types and adjusting in
[SPEAKER_08]: that way a bit the way how you're growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it can be possible to grow small
scale and have still an internal
[SPEAKER_08]: investment.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a challenge I think we can face
altogether in industry and find a way
[SPEAKER_08]: forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Change the politics, the politicians,
I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to steer it in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we still have room for a question?
[SPEAKER_06]: We still have room for one more question.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have three minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if anyone would like to sing a song,
or we could have a trivia contest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like there's one at the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there one in the back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a microphone right there for you,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my friend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gentlemen, in terms of all the new data
and possibilities to extract them from
[SPEAKER_07]: what we are actually doing, you find
yourselves seeing living soil having a
[SPEAKER_07]: bigger space in the upcoming cultivation
technologies?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some cultivators that do very well
with living soil, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to take the correct mindset
to be able to be successful, but living
[SPEAKER_04]: soil is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The product's as good as it gets.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure, you can grow in living soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only downside I potentially see is
uniformity and having always the same
[SPEAKER_08]: product there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is probably the difficult thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you can find a way to have it a bit
more standardized and that you know that
[SPEAKER_08]: every time you start with it, it's the
same as what you initially did,
[SPEAKER_08]: then I think it definitely has a future in
the industry in the growing system.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting into a whole new high
science with living soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should have started with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I could go crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just have to do a living soil panel
next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's amazing things being done in
living soil and also in technology to make
[SPEAKER_03]: soil work in large scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, I think it's possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love my cucumbers on living soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great veggies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we all do.
[SPEAKER_05]: My cannabis is grown on rock wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, one more.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a question?
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on over to the microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a simple question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell also CO2 generators and CO2
regulators and bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis plants love CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: High levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can have more in the atmosphere as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just having bigger plants out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You think Los Angeles would grow the best
weed?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so much CO2 in the air down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: How about it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just grow in a big polluted city outside
and get all the CO2 you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it that big of a difference if you use
like CO2 or those on generator or some
[SPEAKER_06]: things like that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, if you, for example,
I just talked to a customer, they ran out
[SPEAKER_05]: of CO2 supply.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't there week six, 1,400 micro mole
really driving the Porsche.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're in a sense of like, they're really
growing on the edge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, CO2 wasn't there anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the plants get really problems once
you start supplementing and you're full on
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going through withdrawals.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got them hooked.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same with everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you take the water away, the light
intensity, the plants get all your marks.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like me without caffeine or THC.
Probably.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're both.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: The plant just has vivid dreams but
doesn't do much.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's hear it again for our panel that
was very enlightening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stand up, take your pictures.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to move on to the next panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the International Cannabis
Business Conference Berlin 2024.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to our title sponsors,
the Tellman Group.
