[SPEAKER_02]: All right, here to discuss the European
Cannabis Industry, the head of the
[SPEAKER_02]: European Cannabis Group for Dentons,
let's hear it for Peter Humburg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: One year ago, I have been standing here
and presented what was a plan for
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization, which was significantly
different from the original proposal of
[SPEAKER_01]: the German government back in October
2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, and I have to say that,
and sorry for disturbing the party,
[SPEAKER_01]: a partial legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are far away from full legalization,
which the government actually wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: establish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Germans wouldn't be Germans if
they are not funny stories about all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, Germans have a very special
sense of humor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me just enlighten you with two
very funny stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one, our Chancellor Olaf Scholz,
as you may know, is currently in China
[SPEAKER_01]: having diplomatic talks in China regarding
various issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yesterday, in an official statement about
the talks, in a side remark, he said the
[SPEAKER_01]: Chinese nation should not get the
impression that all Germans are now
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of statement is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even the Chinese president could
have said, well, you should not get the
[SPEAKER_01]: impression that 1.4 billion Chinese people
are getting drunk every evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as I said, it's kind of a sad,
rather sad story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, where is Nao?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you actually have weed, and you're
smoking, you're not a patient,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's the next funny story,
and you're traveling to Baden-Württemberg,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is one of our states here,
it could be that the police is questioning
[SPEAKER_01]: you where you have the weed from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for home-grow, it's too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 15 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't grow that at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: The social clubs or the cultivation
associations are not yet in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, where did you get your
weed from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And your questions, of course,
as a witness, because after the
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization, you will not be punished if
you are carrying less than 25 grams in
[SPEAKER_01]: public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't answer correctly,
you can be imprisoned for contempt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the police in
Baden-Württemberg actually said,
[SPEAKER_01]: so don't travel to Stuttgart and smoke
openly, I would say, at least for the time
[SPEAKER_01]: being.
[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome to the club, last one laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're going to do this morning,
after these funny stories, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a bit more serious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see whether I can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are talking about a little bit of
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we all are interested in
besides the various legalization issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to take you on a journey
through various European countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we stand there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I will enlighten you.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit about Germany and what is
going to happen there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just really saying what are the real
points in this legalization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to Czech Republic,
Malta, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Netherlands, and the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll see what can we expect in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look into the industry
estimates here, and I don't want to bother
[SPEAKER_01]: you too much with facts and facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figure I have only two slides of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that the expectations are
significantly high.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look into the cannabis market in
Europe, forecasted for 2024, it looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: 6.2 billion US dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you look into the medical market,
which was, I would say, nicely developing
[SPEAKER_01]: in Germany, but of course has not reached.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a full extent for various reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a figure which is not too far away
from my point of view from reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have heard this morning prescriptions
within the first 14 days since April 1st
[SPEAKER_01]: have really doubled to some extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an increasing market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw that the legalization of cannabis
taking cannabis and THC rated products out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Narcotics Act would have also a
positive effect on the prescriptions in
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody expected that these figures in
the first two weeks really would appear.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have clients who have platforms
bringing patients, pharmacies,
[SPEAKER_01]: and physicians together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have nearly tripled the
prescriptions in comparison to the time
[SPEAKER_01]: before April 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the medical market is really going
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effect of that legalization,
and we will see that in a minute,
[SPEAKER_01]: is significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the forecasts of the sales
here and the turnover of CBD products,
[SPEAKER_01]: medical products, pharmaceutical cannabis
products, like Sativex, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a significant growth which we will
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this legalization, even if it's only
partial, has a significant effect on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will see other countries,
and I come back to that in a minute,
[SPEAKER_01]: we will see other countries following the
approach of Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know, and I will show you that
once again, why the legalization actually
[SPEAKER_01]: is not what we called a full legalization,
but it has its positive effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, these facts and figures here
may be a little bit too optimistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have seen, even after the
legalization of medical cannabis back in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2017 in Germany, some figures which have
never been reached.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the legalization has a real impact on
the industry, and I will come back to that
[SPEAKER_01]: in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the pathway of Germany,
and I don't want to elaborate too much on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How we actually legalized cannabis here in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most important key points are
October 2022, where the full legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: like in Canada, was proposed by the
government, followed by constructive talks
[SPEAKER_01]: with the European Commission, as Mr.
Lauterbach, our Minister of Health,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have, of course, a little bit of
different definition of constructive,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the outcome is that we have now a
partial legalization with homegrown
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation in clubs, and of course,
the decriminalization, which is a step
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's far away from the full extent of
legalization, as we have seen that in the
[SPEAKER_01]: program of the government back in 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: The German government was afraid of being
sued by the European Commission,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they clearly made a statement,
you should not go forward with that plan,
[SPEAKER_01]: even as a pilot country here in the
European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will sue you before the European
Court of Justice for the breach of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Schengen Agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a convincing argument for the
government not to do the full
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we look right now into the
consumption and cultivation rules here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, and we have heard that this
morning, I've just put that together as a
[SPEAKER_01]: brief summary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the most important one is cannabis has
been removed of the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: The list of prohibited substances in the
German Narcotics Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is now put into the new Cannabis Act,
and of course, all offenses and the
[SPEAKER_01]: punishments have been significantly
reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is still forbidden, actually,
and that is what you should know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to even hand over the wheat which you have
cultivated at home to your friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely no goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot even give it to one of your
family members, actually, if they are not
[SPEAKER_01]: growing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like your uncle who is visiting you from
Stuttgart, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are some, I would say,
very difficult to understand regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: out of this new Cannabis Act, but it has
all to do with the consequences to be
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant as much as possible under the U
.N.
[SPEAKER_01]: 9061 Convention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned the Schengen Agreement and its
protocols.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there should be no sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be no profit-making
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are, and we will see that in a
minute with regard to the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivation Associations, these are not
cannabis social clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are far away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cultivation association where up to
500 members can come together and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: their wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even third parties are not allowed to
touch the plant, but only members can do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all what we have seen in the
Cannabis Act, which is in parts very
[SPEAKER_01]: detailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other parts, it has lots of loopholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, of course, here in private
space, you can store up to 50 grams dried
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the last amendment in the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why 50 grams?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you cultivate three flowers,
or if you have two family members who are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing six flowers and you're harvesting
it, well, I'm not a cultivator,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this can definitely be reached
quickly, the 50 grams dried flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have increased that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 25 gram of, you can carry,
not only four, you can actually carry 25
[SPEAKER_01]: gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea why 25 grams should be
here, the threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may ask those who have actually
implemented it in the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 gram is a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, well, there are calculations,
70, 70 joints, something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't sound wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is what you can carry in public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we have some rules and
regulations which are somehow straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a range, for example,
where you can actually smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, away from kindergartens,
sport arenas, et cetera, where you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep a distance of 100 meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also something in provision in the
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't see it, the school,
the kindergarten, you can actually smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be less than 100 meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are not allowed to smoke in pedestrian
areas in the time between, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: 8 AM till 8 PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't count me on that time,
for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I said, it is, to a certain extent,
an interesting approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will see how this actually will
work out in the next weeks, when everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: can harvest at home and when the social
clubs or cannabis cultivation associations
[SPEAKER_01]: will become active with July 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just a word with regard to these
social clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law now is totally silent on where,
how, and under which circumstances,
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation association can apply for
license to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is left now to the states and,
of course, to the communities to set up
[SPEAKER_01]: rules and regulations under which
circumstances the cultivation associations
[SPEAKER_01]: can actually operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, frankly speaking, they are helpless.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are helpless.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are looking for guidance because,
you know, they have neither the
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure nor the personnel nor the
financials in order to really implement
[SPEAKER_01]: this infrastructure to control the clubs,
to license the clubs, to check the
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such, I am not that confident that
we will very quickly see those cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: associations being operated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, 1st of July is the due date.
[SPEAKER_01]: So until then, the respective authorities
have to have implemented the respective
[SPEAKER_01]: rules and regulations for these clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are already so-called Vereine,
as we say in Germany, who have established
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves and who are ready to get into
operation, but they don't even know to
[SPEAKER_01]: whom they should file any kind of
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not even a form in which they
could actually send the application and,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, no authority.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have a look into the medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned that already.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, for the medical cannabis,
a big step forward that cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: THC-related products are taken out of the
German Narcotics Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a new prescription requirement,
which is less strict as the prescription
[SPEAKER_01]: of a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So physicians do not have even to register
with the Bayfarm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should not use the, I would say,
red prescription blocks, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: a psychological barrier anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: To prescribe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that relaxation has actually caused the
increase of prescriptions in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is, of course, also important,
the certain relaxations with regard to
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can actually purchase your weed
with the respective prescriptions in the
[SPEAKER_01]: final pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having said that for Germany, we jump into
the next, or travel to the next country,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Czech Republic has always been
supportive of the German approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very open with respect to the legalization
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And medical cannabis was already legalized
back in 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the use of recreational cannabis is
still illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also some rules with regard to
new substances, which came up on that
[SPEAKER_01]: market, which, of course, also are causing
some issues here, like HHCO and THCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will see in a minute that the Czech
government is taking care of these as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is expected here is that there will
be a certain legalization in due course in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Czech Republic as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 2025, actually, at the beginning of
2025, these restrictions of these new
[SPEAKER_01]: seven substances will be reviewed again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is still kind of a standstill.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started our legalization process
in Germany, they were very forthcoming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's slowed down a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, the Czech Republic wanted to
go for full legalization in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge the European Commission and see
what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Risking to be sued before the European
Court of Justice for the violation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Schengen Agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is off the table, at least until now,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they would have, of course,
one of those countries which have actually
[SPEAKER_01]: then, probably before the European Court
of Justice at least, make their standpoint
[SPEAKER_01]: very clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it's a little bit of a
change right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We travel to Malta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not the largest member within the
European Union, but one of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we heard this morning, who started
their legalization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, indeed, it looks like that the
Germans legislature has copied a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of what the Maltese government has
done with regard to the cannabis social
[SPEAKER_01]: clubs, which are the CHRA, Cannabis Harm
Reduction Associations.
[SPEAKER_01]: In January 2024, so just recently,
the first club actually became active,
[SPEAKER_01]: started its operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Maltese have actually established
an authority for the responsible use of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, who actually are testing the
quality of the weed which is cultivated in
[SPEAKER_01]: these clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jumping back to Germany, yes, this will
happen here as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is going to be tested is not clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is clear is that the members who are
between 18 to 21 only get flowers with a
[SPEAKER_01]: THC content of 10% or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: With only 30 grams, all other adults above
21, there's no limit except that they will
[SPEAKER_01]: get only 50 grams a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's GACP or whether anybody is
asking for GMP or just a regular control
[SPEAKER_01]: with regard to any kind of substances is
also not yet clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have an authority in Malta who is
taking care of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, from Malta, from the little
island in the Mediterranean to Portugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2018, we had already the legalization of
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recreational is not legal, but it has been
decriminalized to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look into consumption and
possession of small amounts there will be
[SPEAKER_01]: no real punishment, which is a step
forward there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, of course, away from what we have
done here in Germany with regard to the
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization and the very, very strict
decriminalization of possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, there are two drafts in
Portugal that allow the consumption,
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, and possession of cannabis
for recreational use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, well, we'll see what the government
will do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a certain instability in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see whether they will move
forward following Germany maybe with that
[SPEAKER_01]: model which is in line with what the
European Commission actually in the
[SPEAKER_01]: constructive talks with the Germans have
actually asked to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Portugal to the larger neighbor,
Spain, medical cannabis is not yet
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cultivation of cannabis for research
and medical and scientific purposes is
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibited and less authorized,
of course, by the Spanish Agency for
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicinal Products and Medical Devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ministry of Health actually announced
in February 2024 that it had started the
[SPEAKER_01]: progress to develop a royal decree with
which it plans to approve the regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit behind Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, nearly seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll see what actually will Spain be
doing, despite that, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you know, in Spain we have these
cannabis clubs, a great number of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: clubs where actually you can go and
consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, back to Germany, in these cannabis
clubs or cultivation associations,
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption is not allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, what you just can do as a member
you can go there and collect your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, even no space, no room allowed
where you can actually consume your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to take it home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different, of course, from the model which
we see in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not comparable at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis clubs in Spain are not
comparable to the cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: associations in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are lots of rules and
regulations with regard to where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually grow as one of these cannabis
clubs here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will be interesting to see what
the state government and the communities
[SPEAKER_01]: are bringing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, to Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland, not being a member of the
European Union, actually has implemented
[SPEAKER_01]: these scientifically controlled pilot
projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you may have heard about that,
the UN conventions, the various UN
[SPEAKER_01]: conventions, in particular the UN
Convention 9061, exempts the use and
[SPEAKER_01]: transfer of cannabis or cannabis for
medical purposes and, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: for scientific purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is actually what the Germans
anticipated here and have implemented into
[SPEAKER_01]: the second pillar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, as we heard this morning already,
the legalization process has two pillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: First is homegrown cultivation in clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, the second one is the
implementation of scientifically
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled pilot projects, very much the
same as Switzerland has done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we are expecting the first
draft law on that before Christmas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the Easter bunny didn't bring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see when we actually will get the
first draft on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that the ministries are working on
that for the implementation of these pilot
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know yet whether the dispensaries
will be licensed, how to register as a
[SPEAKER_01]: participant in these pilot projects,
what are the numbers of pilot projects,
[SPEAKER_01]: in which regions do we have them,
how many actually can participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is all unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will see that in due course,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to have the implementation of the
second pillar of that legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: process, which is, of course, a step
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I think what is important to know
is that the third pillar, which nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: actually has recognized, is that the
German government is going to seek other
[SPEAKER_01]: countries in Europe to influence the
decision-making process at the European
[SPEAKER_01]: Commission level.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that, they would like to gain data,
see what is the impact of the
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once these data has been gained,
they will definitely go to the European
[SPEAKER_01]: Commission in order to convince them to
change the prohibition policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very important step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's really talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's an important part of the
legalization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that, as I said, we need that
scientifically controlled pilot projects
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to get to gain data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look into Switzerland,
they have actually these seven different
[SPEAKER_01]: pilot trials, as we call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them have already been active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are being set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The script, for example, Weed Care and
Zuriken, these are these projects,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually PPP, Public-Private Partnerships,
together with the university, who are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to collect the respective data of
the use of cannabis and what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: impact it may have.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the model which Germany is going
to implement, to which extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a couple of words to the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, since 2003, medical cannabis was
permitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And already back in 1976, the use of
recreational cannabis was permitted if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have reached the legal age.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a long history of the use of
cannabis for recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know this coffee shop system where
you actually could get in and buy and
[SPEAKER_01]: consume cannabis, which was not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was legalized, but it was accepted,
which is a speciality of the Dutch
[SPEAKER_01]: criminal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Germany, you couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a different principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to implement and rule the
respective laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Netherlands, they are following a
system where they can but not have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they did, actually
ignoring the use of cannabis in these
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee shops, which were actually illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, now they are starting up as well
to implement these kind of projects,
[SPEAKER_01]: scientifically controlled as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a startup phase with respect to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are going to a certain extent to
legalize now their coffee shop system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smart move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, also in the borderlines of the
European Commission guidelines and,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, the Schengen agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have, as you know, license out to
10 cultivators in Netherlands to serve the
[SPEAKER_01]: market with cultivated cannabis for
recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we are leaving the European Union
and jumping into the United Kingdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look into the UK CBD market,
for example, you will find a great number
[SPEAKER_01]: of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those who are either living there or
who have visited the UK, they have seen
[SPEAKER_01]: all the shops with regard to CBD products,
which are, if you look into the European
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation, not permitted, in particular
with regard to food supplements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, as you know, you know,
food supplements containing CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: which, according to the decision of the
European Court of Justice, is not a
[SPEAKER_01]: narcotic, needs a registration under the
novel food directive of the European
[SPEAKER_01]: Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, we have companies who have
applied for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the applications have been put on hold
by the respective directorate of the
[SPEAKER_01]: European Commission because the respective
safety data they provided were not
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have asked for more data and more
data and again for more data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now all the applicants who are left
over, I think of 50, around 35,
[SPEAKER_01]: which have formed groups in order to get
the costs actually divided between them
[SPEAKER_01]: for gaining those data, are, I would say,
frustrated by that approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the United Kingdom, if you look into
the medical market, it's a very limited
[SPEAKER_01]: market, very limited market with regard to
the indications and very limited market
[SPEAKER_01]: with regard to who actually can prescribe
the respective medical products.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look over into what's going to
happen here, there's a leaked report for a
[SPEAKER_01]: pilot project for decriminalization of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll see what it will bring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, the office of the mayor of
London is up to reelection in May this
[SPEAKER_01]: year, though just shortly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see what actually this has as an
impact on the new cannabis legislation
[SPEAKER_01]: they are looking forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though it's all connected, of course,
to politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our chancellor in China, the mayor in
London having elections, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is the law, is made by politicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we have actually to lobby
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look into Scotland, it is
interesting because in Scotland,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ruling is that of the Scottish
National Party, they advocated a kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalization of drugs, including
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scotland has one of the highest drug death
rates in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that before I went into the
investigation of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hopefully will see a change in the
policy approach and a kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalization probably to the back
door as outlined here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So coming to the end of my presentation,
let's have a look where do we stand here
[SPEAKER_01]: and today in Germany and in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legalization for medical cannabis in
recreational purposes gains momentum in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is getting into the discussion
of legalization of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the pleasure to be invited to
Slovenia to speak before the National
[SPEAKER_01]: Council about the legalization process in
Germany, of course, starting with medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are other countries,
not only Slovenia, but also in the Czech
[SPEAKER_01]: Republic, for example, and other parts of
the European Union, who are looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: what is Germany doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such, it may have a pulling effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are looking into more and more
legalization, at least for medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not legalized in each and every
country of the European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, we should actually try to
get at least a harmonization within the
[SPEAKER_01]: European Union, at least for medical and
earlier or later also for recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: The obstacle as we know is the Schengen
Convention and the EU Council framework
[SPEAKER_01]: decision of 2004.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, the various single
conventions to which the European Union
[SPEAKER_01]: actually is also a party and as such very
reluctant to allow member states to go
[SPEAKER_01]: forward with a full legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we look into the political
challenges, and we heard that this morning
[SPEAKER_01]: as well from Georg, there are,
of course, in all countries, parties,
[SPEAKER_01]: groups, which are strictly against the
legalization of cannabis, not only for
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational, but also for medical
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in Germany, and we have to say that
very clearly, the opposition very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very clearly said that they were against
the legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are still of that opinion today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more we go forward, the more we
step into a legalization, and the more
[SPEAKER_01]: experience we will have, the more data we
will have with the legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: the better the arguments are to do the
next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nevertheless, I am convinced that more
countries in Europe will go that path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such, our legalization in Germany
wasn't all that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good step forward,
even if it's not the full legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: which we expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter Homburg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter Homburg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have time for a question or
two, maybe, if there's a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone have a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Derek has a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is about the talks that the
German government said they had with the
[SPEAKER_00]: European Commission.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's unclear to me is there is no name
of who they talked to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no date.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no official release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has there really been this discussion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell a bit more about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there discussion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there was a discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe our Minister of Health that he's
telling the truth on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is and was not a formal process.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no process in order to get the
opinion or to get the confirmation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: European Commission that we can go
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an informal talk of the ministry
and the group who wanted to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know to whom they talked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, probably to the directorate
which is responsible for the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical developments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is indeed not even published.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just said they have constructive
talks with the European Commission.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said before, I have a little bit of a
different understanding of what
[SPEAKER_01]: constructive really means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between us, they have been feared away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could have, of course, gone forward
with the legalization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could have not been stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, they could have been
actually sued before the European Court of
[SPEAKER_01]: Justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Germany just lost two large cases
before the European Court of Justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were afraid of another one from my
point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the reason why we have this
two-step legalization process which is far
[SPEAKER_01]: away from the total legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have time for one more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I wore comfortable shoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll remind you also that there's
microphones back there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Peter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess my question is regarding Pillar 2
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: In your opinion, what are the chances that
it gets passed and implemented prior to
[SPEAKER_03]: the October 2025 election?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crystal ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the opposition, the conservative
parties would succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have made statements since the
legalization even before that they would
[SPEAKER_01]: like to reverse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether they really will do that is
another question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a democracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there are different
opinions about the legalization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my point of view, it would be
difficult to totally reverse that
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization without getting at least a
significant strong opinion against it,
[SPEAKER_01]: to say it in a more diplomatic way,
more diplomatic than Olaf Scholz yesterday
[SPEAKER_01]: in China.
[SPEAKER_01]: So difficult to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe, frankly speaking,
that they will totally reverse that
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization, which is, from my point of
view, already, as you would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: written in stone at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Pillar 2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter Holmberg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he makes a good point.
