[SPEAKER_08]: after party tonight tickets for berlin
support our exhibitors upstairs and here
[SPEAKER_08]: comes our next panel to discuss advances
in cannabis production methods to lead
[SPEAKER_08]: this panel uh he is a hashish aficionado
and a good hash breaker i've tried his
[SPEAKER_08]: hash it is delicious he's the inventor of
the bubble bags which revolutionized the
[SPEAKER_08]: hashish creation game for the home grower
and they're all here for us this afternoon
[SPEAKER_08]: let's hear it for barkus richardson
[SPEAKER_07]: all right thank you everybody sorry i have
so much stuff but uh i got a dab
[SPEAKER_07]: everywhere i go i'm really happy to be
here i want to thank alex rogers first of
[SPEAKER_07]: all for creating the icbc it's a really
wonderful conference i've always had a
[SPEAKER_07]: great time here i've never actually
moderated a panel here i've always spoken
[SPEAKER_07]: on the panel myself but uh we're going to
get right into it i'm going to introduce
[SPEAKER_07]: you to our panelists that we have here
hopefully i pronounce everyone's name
[SPEAKER_07]: correctly and of course i want to welcome
you the audience here into beautiful
[SPEAKER_07]: barcelona spain at the icbc conference um
so yeah we're going to be talking about
[SPEAKER_07]: advances in cannabis production methods so
i'll give a kind of a small little
[SPEAKER_07]: introduction to each person and then we'll
we'll just sort of start off start off by
[SPEAKER_07]: asking some questions and getting into
sort of a nice organic conversation uh for
[SPEAKER_07]: all of you so uh first and foremost right
next to me here we have timo bong arts uh
[SPEAKER_07]: general manager from fluence for me
fluence needs no introduction incredible
[SPEAKER_07]: lighting company they've really changed
the game when it comes to uh leds um i
[SPEAKER_07]: believe it was one of the first videos i
ever saw from you guys um it was the it
[SPEAKER_07]: was a it was an incredible video this
group in california created using all your
[SPEAKER_07]: lights where everything was pulled out and
connected into the wall it was like uh it
[SPEAKER_07]: was an herbal sanendoa growers association
this video is worth googling if you
[SPEAKER_07]: haven't seen it so yeah there's timo bong
arts from uh fluence lighting uh next to
[SPEAKER_07]: him we have sabrina carvalho did i
pronounce that correctly almost almost
[SPEAKER_07]: tell me how sabrina carvalho carvalho okay
wonderful cannabis plant specialist from
[SPEAKER_07]: philips horticultural led solutions had a
really good conversation with her uh
[SPEAKER_07]: earlier in the green room and i think
we're going to get some great uh great
[SPEAKER_07]: answers from her she's really sharp uh and
on it and has some great uh information in
[SPEAKER_07]: regards to her specialty next to her we
have uh jeremy unis uh commercial sales
[SPEAKER_07]: horticultural supply fos uh and then next
to him we have neil lund global technical
[SPEAKER_07]: advisor from rio coco so super excited to
be here and get right into it so each uh
[SPEAKER_07]: each um panelist has a few different
questions that we're going to ask but
[SPEAKER_07]: we're really going to follow the
conversation organically and and see where
[SPEAKER_07]: it takes us so uh timo we'll start with
you um in regards to the topic that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about today if you've got a
customer you know backwards and make
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions on technology to fulfill this
customer demand right and so i think um
[SPEAKER_01]: they're great technologies out there we
have here different companies um from the
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting space but also from substrate so
um you can make great technology decisions
[SPEAKER_01]: if you really fulfill your business model
and i think it's always important to start
[SPEAKER_01]: from the customer and how to delight your
customer and then make the right decisions
[SPEAKER_07]: on the technology side that's an excellent
answer and it's sort of plays into the
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation that sabrina and i had
earlier in the green room which is you
[SPEAKER_07]: know i had kind of said one of the
questions i wanted to ask you guys was you
[SPEAKER_07]: know as a medium company or lighting
company are you focused on the production
[SPEAKER_07]: of say i'm i'm a hash maker so i'm really
focused from a cannabis perspective on the
[SPEAKER_07]: resin and if you're in medical cannabis
recreational cannabis whether you know it
[SPEAKER_07]: or not it's really all about the resin the
resin is the active ingredient and by
[SPEAKER_07]: resin i mean the cannabinoids that the
plant's producing as well as all of the
[SPEAKER_07]: volatile organic compounds which a lot of
us are calling terpenes today but it's a
[SPEAKER_07]: much wider range of molecules including
esters and aldehydes and thiols and
[SPEAKER_07]: thiolates these are all volatile organic
compounds so i had asked sabrina like you
[SPEAKER_07]: know your company philips are you guys
focused on vegetative yield and vegetative
[SPEAKER_07]: growth which was really been the sort of
most important factor in the days of
[SPEAKER_07]: prohibition how much can i get and how
fast can i get it versus are you more
[SPEAKER_07]: focused on instead of the vegetative
yields of the plant the production of
[SPEAKER_07]: these compounds volatile organics and
cannabinoids she had a great answer which
[SPEAKER_07]: timo really just sort of mirrored which
was go ahead well my answer was that it
[SPEAKER_03]: really depends on what the client requires
we can design lighting technology for any
[SPEAKER_03]: type of requirement but we need to
understand what is your market what are
[SPEAKER_03]: you going for and then we steer the best
solutions we have currently for that and
[SPEAKER_03]: then we can also combine it with other
technologies because light doesn't work
[SPEAKER_03]: alone even and it's like timo was saying
we need to understand what type of
[SPEAKER_03]: substrates you're going to use what type
of systems do you have implemented do you
[SPEAKER_03]: have what type of capacity on humidity
temperatures you name it combine
[SPEAKER_03]: everything together to understand what are
you going to be able to achieve we do have
[SPEAKER_03]: projects where we can even say that type
of light that you are requesting is too
[SPEAKER_03]: much for the capacity that you have right
now so either something needs to change or
[SPEAKER_03]: we need to tone it down because you can't
have it all running together in a balanced
[SPEAKER_01]: way so yeah and maybe also to bring the
other two in and I think we Jeremy you are
[SPEAKER_01]: active in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot and you see also how strain
dependent it is and so and you open
[SPEAKER_01]: another total new box of discussion maybe
you can take it from there absolutely yeah
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with you guys it's all about what
the customer is looking for but we're
[SPEAKER_09]: learning more and more how we can push
some of these cultivars with some of the
[SPEAKER_09]: LED technology that we have today and and
drive these plants and it's not just LEDs
[SPEAKER_09]: it's all the it's all of the inputs it's
the the plant steering it's your nutrient
[SPEAKER_09]: input it's your substrate it's your shot
sizes everything is going to all of your
[SPEAKER_09]: inputs your outputs a result of it so we
almost need to come up with a term for
[SPEAKER_07]: that because you know what you're saying
even though you were talking about from my
[SPEAKER_07]: perspective more of a greenhouse and an
indoor sort of production in the outdoor
[SPEAKER_07]: when we talk about our inputs when we talk
about all the variables the the the
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds that are in the soil the
humidity all of these things become the
[SPEAKER_07]: terroir but what is the terminology
because those things just just because
[SPEAKER_07]: they're not natural necessarily like
happening in nature in an open sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: situation maybe we're controlling them but
what do we call that you know all of those
[SPEAKER_07]: inputs because they do they basically
decide how the plant expresses itself and
[SPEAKER_07]: that's really what we're up here talking
about how does the plant express itself
[SPEAKER_03]: when we change those variables if I may
from an horticulture perspective at least
[SPEAKER_03]: in Phillips we don't work only with
cannabis we work with all sorts of crops
[SPEAKER_03]: well we all mostly work with many other
crops as well there's at least from a
[SPEAKER_03]: light perspective there's one unit that we
always ask no matter what type of plant
[SPEAKER_03]: which is grams per mole if you don't know
how to calculate it we actually address
[SPEAKER_03]: all the inputs that you have and we
calculate grams per mole that will give
[SPEAKER_03]: you a direction of the capacity of the
plant to handle more light or less light
[SPEAKER_03]: for example and that will balance with
everything else on the inputs I can
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately say for example if a grower
had a problem with their irrigation the
[SPEAKER_03]: grams per mole will go down or I can
actually compare almost any plant in grams
[SPEAKER_03]: per mole and say you can do better push it
steer it and then we have the other term
[SPEAKER_03]: that is crop steering and that normally
means you are detecting what the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: need to do because you have an aim for
that crop I know it sounds weird but
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is about having high quality
terpenes kind of noise everything needs to
[SPEAKER_03]: be steered understanding how you steer
that crop to achieve what you're looking
[SPEAKER_07]: for is very important and it doesn't
always line up with commercial viability
[SPEAKER_07]: and I think the whole mentality of how
much can we get and how fast can we get it
[SPEAKER_07]: which was really prohibition driven in our
industry lost us to a lot of these sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: landrace exotic sativas plants that take
too long to flower plants that produce
[SPEAKER_07]: novel cannabinoids and volatile organic
compounds I don't want to say they're lost
[SPEAKER_07]: forever but we pushed them so far out as
outliers that it's only a very select
[SPEAKER_07]: group of people who are sort of focused on
that and they're generally not the ones
[SPEAKER_03]: that are doing the big work we have sorry
I'm speaking again but that's okay we're
[SPEAKER_07]: gonna get around we wanted to keep it
organic we're gonna get to Neil in a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit here so we have to see it in
all other crops is the same we have crops
[SPEAKER_03]: there are made for yields are made for the
standard you go to any shop and you expect
[SPEAKER_03]: certain groceries to be there they are
staples they are always there but you also
[SPEAKER_03]: go for the niche so we also need to
understand always what the client is going
[SPEAKER_03]: for even on the aspect of indeed are you
going for rare varieties you cannot expect
[SPEAKER_03]: for example a rare variety a very specific
variety to be as big of a yielder
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes as it is more general variety so
we always address the issue that if you
[SPEAKER_03]: are looking for more yield in a plant that
was not designed for that it was a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that was designed it was chosen to give
you more aroma not more yield you're
[SPEAKER_03]: asking too much of that plant you won't be
you will get frustrated even to work with
[SPEAKER_03]: that plant if you're steering a plant that
was made for aromas and you want to get I
[SPEAKER_07]: don't know a kilo out of it you're asking
it's funny that they don't line up as much
[SPEAKER_07]: as we want them to line up you know
especially and not necessarily me I mean
[SPEAKER_07]: sure I love the idea of a plant producing
a lot of my favorite thing versus wow I
[SPEAKER_07]: did a lot of work I grew this plant for
three months I processed and extracted it
[SPEAKER_07]: and I got a very very little bit back but
I did want to bring Neil into the
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation and sort of in a similar vein
I wanted to ask him what he thought on the
[SPEAKER_07]: effects what effects does growing media
have on the operational efficiency of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cultivation facilities I mean in
my experience I find that speaking with
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial facilities it's very often that
substrate is the last thing on the list of
[SPEAKER_02]: priorities which is astounding given the
fact that your plants roots are in it and
[SPEAKER_02]: it dramatically affects your yield and
even your IPM protocols not to mention the
[SPEAKER_02]: cost put in for labor we still see growers
on a commercial scale filling pots we
[SPEAKER_02]: spoke about that earlier either the labor
or the mechanization to fill these pots
[SPEAKER_02]: where it can be expanded using an existing
drip emitter system also if you're putting
[SPEAKER_02]: together an IPM schedule and an IPM
protocol and you have a growing media that
[SPEAKER_02]: has an extremely high water-holding
capacity you're growing cannabis is likely
[SPEAKER_02]: typically a three-month crop indoors or in
a light depth and they'll never really the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots will never really fully penetrate
the medium especially given the standard
[SPEAKER_02]: low-end coco coir or stone wool or
anything like that you can mitigate
[SPEAKER_02]: pythium and other root pathogens simply by
choosing the correct medium and it becomes
[SPEAKER_02]: a physical mode of action against that and
facilities would do well to consider those
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects of it especially as they try to
scale and as the market corrects itself
[SPEAKER_02]: we're seeing a lot of growers in the US
who expanded very quickly using old
[SPEAKER_02]: methods not logging any data points using
whatever the lowest cost medium they can
[SPEAKER_02]: find is and as the market corrects itself
and the cost per unit plummets they're
[SPEAKER_02]: finding that they need to focus on
different aspects that they can control
[SPEAKER_07]: well you mentioned data points and I know
how absolutely important that is to the
[SPEAKER_07]: advancements of cannabis cultivation and
all of the different industries that you
[SPEAKER_07]: guys come from did you want to speak to a
little bit of that each one of you in
[SPEAKER_07]: order Timo down the line in regards to how
important data points is to a company like
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluence yeah obviously very important we
need to know what we are doing facts and
[SPEAKER_01]: figures really matter I think there's a
lot of stories but not a lot of data
[SPEAKER_01]: generally I think first of all it's
important to have really a controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: environment but of course then to close
the loop and really measuring what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on in the cultivation and we see it in
other horticultural crops as well that you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really measure the environment in a
good way vertically over the whole space
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not granular data it's not real-time
data and so on and we are seeing now more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more environmental sensor companies in
the space and really understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: microclimates and understanding really
what's going on in the grow but then of
[SPEAKER_01]: course the next step is also to act on it
sometimes to control areas other than too
[SPEAKER_01]: big and you know you have microclimates
over there there's a pest starting and so
[SPEAKER_01]: on so the data driven is extremely
important to control the grow and and act
[SPEAKER_07]: on it yeah I think of the sense in data
production and data collection as
[SPEAKER_07]: prosthetics that allow us to perceive
things that we are unable to perceive
[SPEAKER_07]: otherwise I can't remember which one of
you I was speaking with in regards to my
[SPEAKER_07]: friend Johnny B buying this incredibly
expensive light meter and just starting to
[SPEAKER_07]: play around with it and his mind just
expanded he couldn't believe the
[SPEAKER_07]: differences in his room in his backyard
just from one foot over to another two
[SPEAKER_07]: foot section and how different what he was
seeing so this is very important that we
[SPEAKER_07]: can use these prosthetics to perceive
things that our senses don't allow us to
[SPEAKER_07]: to create these data points to you know
better our technology better our SOPs and
[SPEAKER_07]: and ideally better the the plant that
we're producing in the end did you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: oh go ahead Neil I just wanted to say that
in this example of your friend you know if
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a different light regime
happening in this area of the grow but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's in a cocoa substrate it's still
irrigated in this same way so what do you
[SPEAKER_01]: think where you have the most issues
happening right if you have inconsistency
[SPEAKER_01]: in your grow that is the biggest issue and
I think all investment into technology to
[SPEAKER_01]: have really full control to have a really
controlled environment is is a good
[SPEAKER_03]: investment for sure absolutely go ahead
Sabrina well two things one is I'm a
[SPEAKER_03]: researcher I came from the academic
background so I have learned the power of
[SPEAKER_03]: data and sometimes even even the most
basic aspect of collecting data doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: need to be technological you don't need
the fancier tools consistency is key if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're measuring any type of data that you
decide that is important for you measure
[SPEAKER_03]: consistently if you're measuring in spot a
always measure in spot a is very difficult
[SPEAKER_03]: for us to help you design the best
lighting the best irrigation schedules the
[SPEAKER_03]: best volume of substrate for your facility
to enjoy it if you don't measure
[SPEAKER_03]: consistently having measurements in the
room but in different spots all the time
[SPEAKER_03]: is inconsistent it sounds bizarre but it's
very inconsistent and often is very
[SPEAKER_03]: frustrating for the growers for the
projects and for ourselves because they
[SPEAKER_03]: have been collecting data sometimes for
years but so inconsistently even on the
[SPEAKER_03]: spot that they were doing it that we can't
use it because the importance of you can
[SPEAKER_07]: perceive a lot especially when you're
using these prosthetics that are
[SPEAKER_07]: perceiving even more you can log an
incredible amount of data but now the
[SPEAKER_07]: trick becomes just like it is with
anything how well do you perceive the data
[SPEAKER_07]: that you log and how are you how are you
reading it yeah that is very very
[SPEAKER_03]: important and then the other aspect is
indeed to trust the experts of that
[SPEAKER_03]: technology they were the ones that
developed but don't find it odd that a
[SPEAKER_03]: light company will start asking questions
about those as well I am a plant I'm a
[SPEAKER_03]: grower of plants they don't grow only on
light so I will go to a project and I will
[SPEAKER_03]: start asking what is the irrigation
schedules what is your substrate what
[SPEAKER_03]: substrate are you using what is the volume
of it because you can't ask me to do a
[SPEAKER_03]: light plan of a thousand micromoles of
light and not expect me to ask questions
[SPEAKER_03]: about that because I can put you almost as
many light as you want but then if your
[SPEAKER_03]: system cannot handle it then you're asking
too much of your plants you're asking too
[SPEAKER_03]: much of your system you're going to get
frustrated of it you're calling every one
[SPEAKER_03]: of us saying my system is not working and
we will try to explain why but consistency
[SPEAKER_03]: and understanding the capacity of it is
also important you can have great
[SPEAKER_03]: technology yes but there are levels you
don't have to have all the fancy
[SPEAKER_03]: technology it needs to be is stable stable
just balance it is key I can put as many
[SPEAKER_03]: as much light as you want all dynamics
control all fancy stuff but then
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else cannot keep up with it
then what's the point yeah balance your
[SPEAKER_07]: technologies is definitely key I like that
Jeremy you want to chime in on some data
[SPEAKER_09]: points in the importance to foes coming in
loud and clear absolutely coming from 20
[SPEAKER_09]: plus years growing we didn't have a lot of
these data points to analyze it was just
[SPEAKER_09]: plug in an HPS light if you had a light
meter then man you're way out of things
[SPEAKER_09]: and we really didn't know how much water
was inside the substrate we had EC meters
[SPEAKER_09]: we have pH meters basically in the black
market so I'm talking obviously 10-15
[SPEAKER_09]: years ago things have really changed a
whole lot now we can now there's a whole
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of talk obviously a lot of talk about
PPFD and the the light intensity and how
[SPEAKER_09]: we can drive these plants and different
cultivars because each different cultivar
[SPEAKER_09]: is going to be able to take and handle a
different amount of PPFD now what we've
[SPEAKER_09]: discovered is most cultivars even if
they're kind of exotic it seems like a
[SPEAKER_09]: pretty fair amount of them can handle a
high light intensity or high PPFD but
[SPEAKER_09]: there are obviously the finicky strains
that that you know maybe some of the high
[SPEAKER_09]: oil producers that that you would like
seems like the exotic strains are always a
[SPEAKER_09]: little more finicky but man they obviously
produce some really amazing terms that
[SPEAKER_07]: word is volatile volatile they're volatile
extremely volatile we're gonna get back to
[SPEAKER_07]: you on the PPFD and the importance of
better understanding that that's gonna be
[SPEAKER_07]: a question I ask you in a little bit but I
wanted to get into Neil you also mentioned
[SPEAKER_07]: you know how to know how much moisture is
in so I want you to mention in regards to
[SPEAKER_07]: your data points but then I was going to
ask you the soil moisture session question
[SPEAKER_07]: the soil moisture sensors in regards to
how this is allowing growers to increase
[SPEAKER_07]: yields by bringing crop steering practices
from traditional agriculture to cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: and then we'll get into what other
technologies from the greenhouse industry
[SPEAKER_07]: do you see growers adopting but first I
want you to mention what your company
[SPEAKER_07]: looks at in regards to the importance of
data points the biggest thing that we look
[SPEAKER_02]: for is water holding capacity in relation
to volume so your volumetric water content
[SPEAKER_02]: that also brings in your air fill porosity
which dictates your bulk density or is
[SPEAKER_02]: dictated by your bulk density these are
all aspects that really will show how much
[SPEAKER_02]: oxygen is available to the roots and allow
growers to plan out a solid for negation
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule but it kind of leads into the
soil moisture sensors what we're seeing is
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis industry immediately adopted
the soil moisture sensors or it seemed
[SPEAKER_02]: that way but it happened very quickly but
honestly it's putting the cart before the
[SPEAKER_02]: horse back in the 80s growers in
commercial tomato production we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: by weight they're going by known
quantities that don't require a extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: fancy meter to that requires calibration
and everything else it's pretty easy to
[SPEAKER_02]: determine how much water your medium is
holding because a milliliter is always
[SPEAKER_02]: going to equal a gram you know and and you
can map out your dry backs based on that
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's astonishing to me how few if any
growers really are measuring the weight of
[SPEAKER_02]: their slabs or their their pots going as
they build out their data logging that's
[SPEAKER_02]: not to say that it's not exciting to see
these water holding these water capacity
[SPEAKER_02]: meters but I too often am in conversations
with growers who are looking at it like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the magic bullet without really
looking at the full picture if some data
[SPEAKER_02]: point doesn't look right to you or if
you're having some issue start looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: it from a couple other angles to really
determine the problem yeah thank you in
[SPEAKER_03]: that sense I find it amazing because we
have that a lot we have it that they start
[SPEAKER_03]: using sensors and there's like okay I
always say if you're using a new sensor do
[SPEAKER_03]: both you're having your logger yes but do
the old technique together and see what
[SPEAKER_03]: which one shows what don't just go for
what just do both because one shows they
[SPEAKER_03]: synchronize yes but you learn a lot more
about what your plant is actually doing by
[SPEAKER_03]: doing both if you can in the beginning
because like it's a lot of effort you're
[SPEAKER_03]: spending a lot of money investing a lot
don't invest in the technology just
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's often is like do both
nowadays in most most high technology
[SPEAKER_03]: horticulture greenhouses I've ever seen
for example they still do both exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like because they both show little
nuances of the same thing and is also
[SPEAKER_03]: complementary if one doesn't work the
other one is there to back you up so yeah
[SPEAKER_07]: data fundamental yes I think it's also
important the reason we have you know we
[SPEAKER_07]: have these big companies that are
developing things in a really big way and
[SPEAKER_07]: they're doing it because you know
sometimes the smaller growers can't touch
[SPEAKER_07]: the world they can't make it accessible to
everyone so we have this system that we've
[SPEAKER_07]: incorporated to all these other aspects of
our life where we can get our food and our
[SPEAKER_07]: clothes and vehicles and all these
important things that come from these very
[SPEAKER_07]: big big companies but I think it's also
important almost as important as the civil
[SPEAKER_07]: disobedience group of our industry was so
if you are from the corporate entity of
[SPEAKER_07]: this side of cannabis please give some
praise to the people who practice civil
[SPEAKER_07]: disobedience for 30 and 40 and 50 years to
get this industry to be legalized the way
[SPEAKER_07]: it is today we can never forget the
importance of those people so too in large
[SPEAKER_07]: industry should we never forget the small
grower and the important work that they're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing whether they're discovering unique
expressions through unique novel genetics
[SPEAKER_07]: or just growing in a much smaller way that
sometimes the mistakes and the experiences
[SPEAKER_07]: that they have translate to some of these
bigger companies which leads me into the
[SPEAKER_07]: question I wanted to ask you Timo which
was if you were to have your own grow what
[SPEAKER_01]: would be the focus for you yeah I think
it's a similar answer like before for me
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really important in which market I
want to operate and what does my customer
[SPEAKER_01]: want there and build back from there
because you're the customer in this sense
[SPEAKER_07]: there's no industry you're not doing a big
grow for this is like your own personal
[SPEAKER_01]: grow what would be your focus okay I'm
based in Germany Germany is a very hot
[SPEAKER_01]: market maybe at some point maybe and so
there's a lot of maybe so there is for me
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a business guy I don't build a
business on hope not with me so I would
[SPEAKER_01]: not hit the market in Germany right now
and set up a grow indoor facility in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany where I could risk that at some
point they all of a sudden legalize import
[SPEAKER_01]: from beautiful countries like Portugal
Israel you name it and then my business
[SPEAKER_01]: case blows through the roof right so I
need to have control over my business and
[SPEAKER_01]: so right now I would not aim for this
market maybe at a later stage then it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really interesting so then I'm looking for
another market and then maybe I like
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel Israel has a strong domestic market
so you have an avenue to do revenue and
[SPEAKER_01]: then in the midterm you can go and export
that would be interesting and then I look
[SPEAKER_01]: at this market and say okay what is my
competition doing what can how can I
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiate and then I see in Israel as
an example that there is import from
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada why say import from Canada they
have a strong domestic market because they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have a lot of indoor grown
high-quality product yet so maybe that is
[SPEAKER_01]: a great niche to go into and have a
successful business model so for me I
[SPEAKER_01]: really want to have a sustainable
profitable business and that is really
[SPEAKER_01]: important because we see in the cannabis
space all the hype waves and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: market saturate and we see it all over
again and again and I think it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting to be in there in the long
term and have a successful profitable and
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable business that is what would be
interesting for me awesome Jeremy the same
[SPEAKER_07]: question you yourself you're a smoker you
know you're not you're hitting dabs you're
[SPEAKER_07]: smoking joints so if I asked you the same
question what would be your focus if you
[SPEAKER_09]: were to start your own little grow my
focus is if I'm going to start my own
[SPEAKER_09]: little grow because I had to do this for
many years either lose money or make money
[SPEAKER_09]: and it was my own money so the most
important things starting my own grow are
[SPEAKER_09]: my inputs my lighting my irrigation my
fertigation my genetics substrate you know
[SPEAKER_09]: cocoa Rockwell doesn't really matter I'm a
hydroponics grower so either is fine for
[SPEAKER_09]: me I do prefer Rockwell but it's not you
know a sustainable obviously different
[SPEAKER_09]: rabbit hole but the genetics the
irrigation the quality of nutrients that's
[SPEAKER_09]: a big one because there's a variation
there that is all over the map and you
[SPEAKER_09]: could have really great genetics and you
could have really poor nutrient quality
[SPEAKER_09]: and the final product is absolutely going
to be a result of that so let me think
[SPEAKER_09]: environmental control that'd be probably
that's one of the most important pieces to
[SPEAKER_09]: the puzzle you have to have control of
your VPD environmental control you don't
[SPEAKER_09]: want to have big sways from you know peaks
and valleys but the end result for you is
[SPEAKER_07]: to produce a great smoke so you're looking
for specific flavors you're looking for a
[SPEAKER_07]: specific effects and when you say that all
of those inputs are very important it's so
[SPEAKER_07]: that you can get the results that you're
looking for a hundred percent and then
[SPEAKER_09]: which that's actually great timing the
cure the cure is one of the most you know
[SPEAKER_09]: overlooked things I think that you can be
the best cultivator in the world you can
[SPEAKER_09]: have the best genetics you can have the
best nutrients so on and so forth but if
[SPEAKER_09]: you don't have the right control of your
environment on the cure process the drying
[SPEAKER_07]: process it's all for nothing and that's
why I wanted to ask both of you guys this
[SPEAKER_07]: question I wasn't sure how Timo was going
to answer it but I loved his honesty he's
[SPEAKER_07]: a businessman he's looking for specific
markets did you see the importance of
[SPEAKER_07]: these two questions becoming or answers I
should say becoming partnered in the
[SPEAKER_07]: industry it's very important that the that
the businessman and the people who come
[SPEAKER_07]: from a corporate level that really want to
break into these markets and make sure
[SPEAKER_07]: that they're doing it in the right spot
are connected with the boots on the ground
[SPEAKER_07]: who are actually growing these learning
all of these processes learning what they
[SPEAKER_07]: like learning about the trends of these
different flavors and these effects and
[SPEAKER_07]: understanding the importance of cures and
symbiotic relationship of Mike arises fear
[SPEAKER_07]: with roots to sequester compounds to
produce volatile organic compounds all of
[SPEAKER_07]: these things have to be understood and
it's why I've always seen the importance
[SPEAKER_07]: in this industry that we work together
that we don't allow our differences and
[SPEAKER_07]: our divisions to keep us apart because
we'll pay the piper for that we want to
[SPEAKER_07]: work together in all of this and make sure
that both of these guys the just replied
[SPEAKER_07]: very very differently you need points from
both of those camps to create a successful
[SPEAKER_07]: business in cannabis today because we all
know that the pockets of profitability
[SPEAKER_07]: have become elusive they are not as
available as they once were when it was
[SPEAKER_07]: the sort of cowboy days of prohibition
where you could just it was really easy to
[SPEAKER_07]: make money in cannabis like everyone in
high school that sold weed knew I can make
[SPEAKER_09]: money doing this well you could grow 10
pounds and get for forty five hundred
[SPEAKER_07]: dollars a pound oh my god I know grams but
it's incredible all right so let's head
[SPEAKER_07]: over to Neil unless anyone else had
anything to say on top of that I mean I
[SPEAKER_02]: can chime in on this please it's there's
still money in canvas there's still plenty
[SPEAKER_02]: of money in cannabis we need to be more
efficient they're growing tomatoes
[SPEAKER_02]: profitably under electric powered LEDs
it's happening tomatoes do not sell for
[SPEAKER_02]: the same amount as cannabis it's just a
fact and what needs to happen is growers
[SPEAKER_02]: and cultivation facilities need to be able
to build out SOPs that they can base their
[SPEAKER_02]: projects off of you know you can focus on
building out the best terpene profile
[SPEAKER_02]: possible but you need to have a solid
baseline to do that from and from a media
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective it needs you need to have
consistency between batch to batch this is
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a consumable product and if you get
it one time and the EC is within an
[SPEAKER_02]: acceptable medium acceptable range and the
water holding capacity is is within your
[SPEAKER_02]: acceptable range great you reorder it in
six months and you get something
[SPEAKER_02]: completely different then you're back to
square one with that part of your SOPs and
[SPEAKER_02]: what we've seen coming from commercial ag
into cannabis is a lot of the coconut coir
[SPEAKER_02]: so marketed to cannabis growers is all
over the map and it makes building a
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainable business like Timo mentioned
and really being able to maximize the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene profile like you guys mentioned it
makes it almost impossible and you're
[SPEAKER_07]: chasing your tail so you mentioned
tomatoes compared to traditional
[SPEAKER_07]: controlled environmental agricultural
crops such as tomatoes peppers cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: has a pretty short life cycle so given the
reduced time for root establishment how
[SPEAKER_07]: does soil as substrates affect root
development and how does root development
[SPEAKER_07]: affect crop quality and yield it's funny
to ask that question like I don't know it
[SPEAKER_02]: but I would love to hear your answer think
about roots every day it's part of my
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation over and over again every day
and what I'm seeing is growers either
[SPEAKER_02]: using too large a pot coming from older
practices when we were all in the in the
[SPEAKER_02]: basement so to speak you know you're
filling up a 10-15 gallon pot and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigating it whenever it dries back
enough for you that said you can achieve
[SPEAKER_02]: the same canopy space with a much smaller
pot you know if a can cannabis is alive I
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned earlier let's say 90 days a
month of cutting rooting veg and then two
[SPEAKER_02]: months of flowers just for the sake of
argument it's not going to need that high
[SPEAKER_02]: of a that large of a pot it's not the
roots aren't going to fill it out I visit
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities and they have you know a five
gallon pot they budget for a month and
[SPEAKER_02]: then when they go to chop there's barely
any roots in the container and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're not using the optimum
product for what they're doing like the
[SPEAKER_02]: whenever I talk to a grower the first
question I ask is how many square feet of
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy per plant are you shooting for and
it's really all over the map but honestly
[SPEAKER_02]: more often than not they're trying to fill
in a very small area with a ton of media
[SPEAKER_02]: when by using a high quality substrate you
can end up using half the media and it
[SPEAKER_02]: blows people's minds just because it's not
typical but you know we're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes in an 18-liter bag and they're
around for a year right there's no need
[SPEAKER_02]: for an 18-liter pot for cannabis yeah sure
go ahead I wanted to just say it's for I
[SPEAKER_01]: think the same for Sabrina and we are
dealing also a lot with traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture crops and there's often this
question between your traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture and cannabis and every time
it's you know tomatoes and cannabis what
[SPEAKER_01]: why why making these comparison with the
tomato tomato is like a totally different
[SPEAKER_01]: crop right a high-wire crop growing very
differently year-round so so but take
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers because cannabis is a flower and
there is a lot of things you can use from
[SPEAKER_01]: the traditional horticulture traditional
horticulture industry look at presentable
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a short day crop 12 hours you can use
you can see that technology is used in how
[SPEAKER_01]: they are planted how they are you know
after harvesting transported through the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse there's a lot of things where
you can cross pollinate and at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is a plant so and but look more
to floriculture to make comparisons to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis then to a tomato when you want to
compare to a vegetable then look maybe to
[SPEAKER_01]: a shorter crop cycle like a lettuce or
whatever but but the that's why it also
[SPEAKER_01]: was so interesting when back in the days
in Canada they took took tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses and transformed into to
cannabis this is like nuts it's like for
[SPEAKER_01]: me it's like unbelievable to to that this
has been done really but look into
[SPEAKER_01]: floriculture there's interesting things to
cross pollinate cannabis growing but I
[SPEAKER_01]: also remain the you know in my heart I'm a
cannabis guy and there is you said it
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier and we need to stay true to to
where cannabis came from who who stopped
[SPEAKER_01]: this stigmatization and so on so there's a
lot of power and magic in this crop itself
[SPEAKER_01]: and a using people who are coming from the
space and then cross pollinate from other
[SPEAKER_01]: industries this is I think that the best
recipe for for success absolutely I've
[SPEAKER_07]: always found you know with cannabis
nature's figured it all out you know a
[SPEAKER_07]: living soil a mycorrhizosphere as a son
producing the light spectrum so I asked
[SPEAKER_07]: each of you what your company's doing I
mean you at the end meal your company is
[SPEAKER_07]: going to try and create substrate that is
the best for the root system the best for
[SPEAKER_07]: you know the delivery and sequestering of
the components and compounds that that
[SPEAKER_07]: plant requires to express itself and for
the other three you guys are in the
[SPEAKER_07]: frequencies and the light phases of how do
we create lights specifically for this
[SPEAKER_07]: plant Sabrina was talking earlier how they
can put a specific lights onto a plant to
[SPEAKER_07]: increase its shelf life for instance so I
want each of you this may be the last
[SPEAKER_07]: question I ask you and then we'll request
a little bit of questions maybe from the
[SPEAKER_07]: audience I think we're done in about 10
minutes so if you want to start and then
[SPEAKER_07]: you can answer and you and you and we can
just mention what is your company doing to
[SPEAKER_07]: try and I guess what we're really doing is
we're trying to recreate what nature has
[SPEAKER_07]: already done and from a light company that
ends up being these different light
[SPEAKER_01]: frequencies so yeah I think for us to to
keep on innovating we we do a lot of photo
[SPEAKER_01]: biology research at different places in
the world and greenhouses indoor and with
[SPEAKER_01]: all different intensities spectra
different light distribution to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: the effect of lighting to the plant and of
course also in in combination with other
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental factors so one thing is
definitely you know research but the other
[SPEAKER_01]: is just being very connected to to your
customers and partners and you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned boots on the ground all markets
are a little bit different and you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: have really this knowledge about these
markets to fulfill really the customer
[SPEAKER_01]: demand so yeah research and on the other
side being really close to the markets and
[SPEAKER_01]: to the growers to understand what they
really need to delight their customers as
[SPEAKER_03]: an add-on to Timo we handle a lot of
customers but we are also working a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: with partnerships we cannot work alone in
this industry it that doesn't work because
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of components affect the end result
like Jeremy was saying even how you cure
[SPEAKER_03]: it is important for me to understand how
my lights are affecting the end result of
[SPEAKER_03]: a crop growth I need to understand what is
happening before that and what is
[SPEAKER_03]: happening after that you can only do that
with partnerships so we partner with all
[SPEAKER_03]: sorts of companies we part we are even
partnering with breeders to understand how
[SPEAKER_03]: are they breeding what are they breeding
for what is that plant going to the market
[SPEAKER_03]: for so that we understand where does our
light fit in that aspect of the crop is
[SPEAKER_03]: very important to partnership and that
brings also the aspect that Timo was
[SPEAKER_03]: saying that look at other flowers there's
a lot of events where they have flower
[SPEAKER_03]: community events they have these we also
work to showcase flower community events
[SPEAKER_03]: where we showcase what growers are doing
they share information with each other on
[SPEAKER_03]: how they are doing it how what how do they
tweak their production to improve
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouses are growing flowers in winter
time and they learn with each other how to
[SPEAKER_03]: tweak it they have supplemental light but
did you know also that in chrysanthemums
[SPEAKER_03]: they change their density of flowers
between winter and summer we see a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: growers for example that wants to keep
consistent densities in cannabis and just
[SPEAKER_03]: like a little trick like this change your
density between winter and summer you will
[SPEAKER_03]: get very similar yields on your on your
space just by tweaking you learn these
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of tweaks by community events by
partnering with other experts of the
[SPEAKER_03]: fields around yours as well so that's what
we do right now thank you go ahead Jeremy
[SPEAKER_09]: I've heard chrysanthemums for many years
but coming from like you know just being
[SPEAKER_09]: an old-school grower tomatoes is always a
common reference but I think something
[SPEAKER_09]: that needs a lot more credit is hops hops
are one of the closest cousins to cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: yep I learned I was hired just real quick
I was hired for by one of the Kendall
[SPEAKER_09]: Jackson people years ago to he's a beer
drinker so he wanted to have hops and get
[SPEAKER_09]: them to the kettle fast because fresh hops
are more valuable and you have a better
[SPEAKER_09]: terpene profile and you can get better
oils out of them I was like huh I didn't
[SPEAKER_09]: really know that there was such a you know
such a lineage between cannabis and hops
[SPEAKER_09]: so family I'd be remiss without mentioning
Nick Ziegler the sensory scientist from
[SPEAKER_07]: Yakima chief hop that discovered over
1,440 thials that were present in hops so
[SPEAKER_07]: that's you know there are people in the
beer industry doing great work that have
[SPEAKER_07]: far surpassed the work that we've done in
regards to volatile organic compounds in
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis so shout out pretty stuff it was
fun to learn about absolutely do you want
[SPEAKER_08]: to go ahead Neil go ahead I was gonna say
we're starting we're out of time so if you
[SPEAKER_08]: want to take some questions yeah yeah
we've got time for a few questions let's
[SPEAKER_08]: hear it for the panel once again Marcus
and everybody Michael Cronold is right
[SPEAKER_07]: there with the microphone she's got her
hand up yeah this is Ed Rosenthal welcome
[SPEAKER_08]: Ed let's hear it for cannabis legend Ed
Rosenthal by the way he fought the fed the
[SPEAKER_08]: United States government to a standstill
he's a monster taught me how to grow in
[SPEAKER_06]: the 80s thanks Ed still have your book on
the shelf so could the panelists comment
[SPEAKER_06]: on carbon allocation in growing cannabis
can you mention that one more time I just
[SPEAKER_07]: missed it carbon allocation did anyone of
you want to take that first or I will ask
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon allocation in what sense because
yeah I can talk about so the co2 footprint
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis kind of oh in this sense is
this it meant like that Ed no what yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: how the plant allocates its carbon that it
gathers okay plants but I'm business guy
[SPEAKER_01]: said at the beginning so maybe from a
plant specialist point of view you mean
[SPEAKER_03]: how a plant can intake carbon or not
because there's I'm asking that because
[SPEAKER_03]: there's different aspects of it so for me
if you're working with light and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: using light the higher amount of light you
use the more co2 you will need to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: this crop do not underestimate it you need
both okay so normally I think that all of
[SPEAKER_03]: us when we are saying you want more light
you need carbon you need to inject carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: because the plants need carbon to feed and
to actually create all the photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_03]: that overnight will transpose into sugars
the cannabis grows during the night but
[SPEAKER_03]: uses carbon during the day to actually
process everything that will happen during
[SPEAKER_03]: the night so that is one of the process of
carbon so I'm not sure if you meant that
[SPEAKER_03]: one but yeah plants are consumers of
carbon nowadays in in horticultural LED
[SPEAKER_03]: solutions we get all sorts of partners
asking us how can horticulture greenhouses
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on be part of the carbon bonds for
commercial purposes because actually we
[SPEAKER_03]: inject carbon into greenhouses indoor
facilities so they technically we are
[SPEAKER_03]: spending a lot of energy and producing a
carbon footprint but we are also consumers
[SPEAKER_03]: of carbon so trying to think ahead of how
can we make a beast like cannabis become
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon neutral or even a carbon positive
sorry negative situation where they can
[SPEAKER_03]: actually feed more carbon than they are
emitting is very interesting into the
[SPEAKER_03]: market on a commercial perspective so I
don't know which one you meant but I hope
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave a hint I appreciate the answer for
sure we had someone else with a question
[SPEAKER_05]: yes one more question yes I wanted to
elaborate it was the carbon allocation
[SPEAKER_05]: patterns of the plant and if you're
studying those in certain cultures how are
[SPEAKER_05]: they you know transmitted through you know
through the grow and how the genetics
[SPEAKER_05]: perhaps affected maybe if you're down that
rabbit hole with the science yeah oh you
[SPEAKER_03]: you will lose your life to within in a
sense we have PhD students focus solely on
[SPEAKER_03]: little details of the carbon entire cycle
of this plant plants react pretty fast
[SPEAKER_03]: often when people ask us about light you
turn your lights on and in a matter of
[SPEAKER_03]: seconds the plant will start functioning
depending on the varieties you will see
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis varieties kicking in a full
photosynthesis in half a minute don't
[SPEAKER_03]: underestimate it that is a thing many
people avoid even injecting carbon during
[SPEAKER_03]: the night it makes sense but you need to
be careful because depending on how
[SPEAKER_03]: photosynthesis go really fast up and
really how it goes down you need to study
[SPEAKER_03]: the mechanism in normal horticulture like
the typical horticulture tomatoes
[SPEAKER_03]: chrysanthemums lettuce as you name it they
start asking on what is the source and
[SPEAKER_03]: sink aspects of cannabis and that for
example is very hard because majority of
[SPEAKER_03]: of the growers that we work with they
never thought of that aspect of the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: so we are starting from scratch on the
source and sink aspects of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: how to steer it but we are working on that
with PhD students master students certain
[SPEAKER_03]: clients that can help us out on trying to
understand this mechanism but it's only
[SPEAKER_03]: the scratching the surface of how this
crop goes we simply need to ask the fungi
[SPEAKER_07]: because the fungi has figured it out tens
of thousands of years ago and if you go
[SPEAKER_07]: outside and you look at any tree they're
sequestering carbon from one another
[SPEAKER_07]: through their micro rhizosphere under the
concrete in the soil the fungi just seems
[SPEAKER_07]: to know what levels of sequestering is
required for each cultivar one more
[SPEAKER_00]: question as a small business owner
transitioning from HPS to LED I found the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest issue for us is affordability so
one of my questions would be is is that
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you as you know working on
in you know technology but is it also
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you're working on in
creating more affordable products as well
[SPEAKER_09]: I can say we have we have foes have
created lower barrier we have a barrier of
[SPEAKER_09]: entry depending on what you're looking for
from a home home cultivator all the way to
[SPEAKER_09]: commercial cultivator so that's something
that we've really focused on a lot in the
[SPEAKER_09]: past 12 months just because there's a lot
of less expensive fixtures out there that
[SPEAKER_09]: are being used for commercial applications
and we just wanted to try and speak to the
[SPEAKER_09]: home growers somebody that's getting into
the space with a you know we understand
[SPEAKER_09]: that it's really expensive to open a
cultivation I open these things for open
[SPEAKER_09]: black market cultivations and then now for
about eight years legal commercial
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivations and it doesn't matter if it's
gray or completely licensed it's it's a
[SPEAKER_09]: really high dollar expense and as we all
know it's it's always takes three times as
[SPEAKER_09]: long and cost twice as much so we have
implemented a new fixture that is foldable
[SPEAKER_09]: that still has a three-year warranty and
is a right around a dollar a watt and then
[SPEAKER_09]: we also have some commercial fixtures that
have a five-year warranty that you know
[SPEAKER_09]: has a can take a little more of a meeting
in a commercial application that is you
[SPEAKER_09]: know depending on what you're looking for
a dollar a watt or right around there just
[SPEAKER_03]: over so I understand I would like to add
on that don't don't be afraid to reach out
[SPEAKER_03]: and ask for a solution for you simply
because sometimes we can even say you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't need to change all your HPS at once
we work with hybrid situations all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time so it for us we've been doing that
with all the other industries they softly
[SPEAKER_03]: transitioned into LEDs if you cannot
afford to swiftly transition immediately
[SPEAKER_03]: we have solutions that you can transition
slowly into LEDs they have longer hours
[SPEAKER_03]: and as every time that you need to switch
you switch a little bit more and a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit more just go slowly don't be afraid to
reach out we have solutions for that you
[SPEAKER_08]: can I hate to cut you off right there but
we are definitely out of time let's hear
[SPEAKER_08]: it for the whole panel we let you guys run
a little longer actually and it was
[SPEAKER_08]: fantastic so we really appreciate it I'm
sure if you have more questions or
[SPEAKER_08]: conversation you could talk to them
outside the auditorium this is the
[SPEAKER_08]: International Cannabis Business Conference
Barcelona 2023 coming up as our final
[SPEAKER_08]: panel of the day give yourselves a round
of applause for being around I know it's
[SPEAKER_08]: hard to get up early in the morning in
Barcelona because no one eats until nine o
[SPEAKER_08]: 'clock and then the clubs don't open until
midnight and then you go out and do the
[SPEAKER_08]: thing and then next thing you know at six
in the morning you got to get up and come
[SPEAKER_08]: here so I'm proud of all of you for making
it here for the nine o'clock start you you
