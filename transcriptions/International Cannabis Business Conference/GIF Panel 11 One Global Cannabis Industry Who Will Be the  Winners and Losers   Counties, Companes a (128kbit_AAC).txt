[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks everybody for staying so late,
so hopefully we'll make it worth your
[SPEAKER_03]: while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this is going to be a very
interesting panel because we have a very
[SPEAKER_03]: diverse set of panelists up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully I'll just kick it over to them
right now and you'll be able to see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, again, we're going to just do
one question and kick it out to you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: to make it very interactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Ollie, do you want to go first?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name's Ollie Lam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm co-founder of Oscar Capital,
and we are a venture fund specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: dedicated to the medical and pharmacy tool
cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name's Brett Worley.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the CEO of MC Global Holdings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our main holding is MC Nutraceuticals,
which is the world's largest cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Trenton Birch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I head up Chiba Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the leading educator and trainer in
the cannabis and hemp space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We train across the full value chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also run a consultancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: South Africa is open for business,
so if anybody would like to buy any of our
[SPEAKER_01]: weed or immerse with us in any way,
we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll unpack that a bit more as we get into
things.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real quick, I don't know if you guys,
where are you guys based?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm based in London, but we have a team in
Paris and some advisors in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: Denver, Colorado, and Czechia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in Johannesburg.
[SPEAKER_03]: To wrap this whole thing up for the end of
the day, and again, talking about maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: where this is going in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we've talked about earlier today,
there's certainly some stigma remains.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question to the panelists then is what
maybe major events or what they see in
[SPEAKER_03]: their business model is going to change
that mindset, whether it's short-term or
[SPEAKER_03]: long-term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting with you, Ollie, too,
that there's been a lot of capital put in
[SPEAKER_03]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result of some of the blowups that
we've talked about a lot today,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of that capital is going to still
stay on the sidelines.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to talk about the stigma as it
relates to operations, as it relates to
[SPEAKER_03]: markets, as it relates to revenue,
as it relates to capital.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ollie, do you want to kick off that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's interesting hearing the talks
today because I think obviously there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of pessimism and there's a lot of
frustration about where we are today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frankly, it's totally reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a pretty depressed state of the
market, but ultimately, it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: surprising, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an emerging sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a novel therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Admittedly, it's been used for generations
and generations, but coupled with the
[SPEAKER_02]: stigma that's been surrounding it for so
long, it's unsurprising that there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance to it being legalized and then
an extremely overhyped hype cycle when it
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I think we're in a strange limbo
situation whereby in reality, although
[SPEAKER_02]: everything does feel very much
appreciated, in terms of true value,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the valuations of today are
actually particularly misaligned with what
[SPEAKER_02]: there is in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I say that is because I
think perhaps we got used to the
[SPEAKER_02]: overexcitement of the late teens of the
last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Realistically, the only way was down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had it not come down yet, instead of us
being pessimistic here about the current
[SPEAKER_02]: low valuations, the current lack of
capital, we'd probably all be terrified
[SPEAKER_02]: about the impending implosion that would
inevitably come.
[SPEAKER_02]: For that reason, we at Oscar Capital are
actually very optimistic now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're at a stage where valuations
are reasonable, where a lot of the chaff
[SPEAKER_02]: has been washed out of the market,
and where ultimately the true benefits of
[SPEAKER_02]: the sector are still there to be realized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's changed fundamentally about what
these products can do for consumers and
[SPEAKER_02]: what they can do for patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's up to us to realize that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm going to shake things up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in the hemp space.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have any of these problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_04]: We export to 26 countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last month, we sold 600 million
10-milligram doses.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have the restrictions that the
cannabis market has to go through.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll use cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bank at Bank of America.
[SPEAKER_04]: They like my money.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't see it as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's a breath of fresh air for
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Florida is the largest cannabis market in
the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think a lot of people know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's because of Delta ATHC.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did an economic report with Bo Whitney,
who will be here in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a $6.9 billion market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what California is off the
top of my head, but it's probably around
[SPEAKER_04]: $5 billion, is my guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost every company, I would say 90%
plus, cashflow positive.
[SPEAKER_04]: No serious investments have come into the
sector for the most part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's been pretty organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I would say done the proper way
because of the lack of regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that being said, there's kind of got
to put some guardrails in.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that I work on on a
state-by-state basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I write most of the laws that go into
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: We lobby in 12 states and we're putting
everything, the GE in the bottle a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit, but we have 480 customers and there's
thousands of online brands that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: buy 42 cannabinoids that we sell from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brad, with what you guys are doing,
do you think that's going to help more
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly alleviate stigmas both here and in
the U.S.?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's already doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're also creating a new customer
base, a customer base that can go in and
[SPEAKER_04]: buy medicine at a smoke shop or a gas
station.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's creating almost, I don't want
to say a soccer mom consumer, but it's
[SPEAKER_04]: giving people the opportunity to try
something that they probably wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_04]: tried alternatively.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, it's killing the black market,
which is bad for some cannabis companies
[SPEAKER_04]: that are still engaged in that,
but it's good for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good for the hemp industry to be able
to say that we're killing the black
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think obviously there's a degree of
pessimism around where we're at with the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, but I think what's important to
remember is, in my opinion, this is one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most important industries of our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We forget about the impact that this can
have on our personal health, the impact
[SPEAKER_01]: that industrial hemp can have on the
planet and sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we're all a bit burnt out,
we're all a bit tired, but you will not
[SPEAKER_01]: find an industry on this planet right now,
apart from maybe AI, where you have such a
[SPEAKER_01]: deeply committed, passionate and
purpose-driven industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people in this industry are in
this industry because they believe in this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant deeply.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've been burnt and we need to
learn from those mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to bang on about the whole
outdoor thing and indoor thing again
[SPEAKER_01]: because I know that people in this room
don't necessarily have control over
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation, but if your cannabis clubs
are restricted to cannabis from Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: firstly, you will fuel the illicit market
because the Colombians and the South
[SPEAKER_01]: Africans and developing economies can grow
for a fraction of that price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there needs to be a much more
global outlook on building this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: because ultimately, it has the potential
to completely seismically change the
[SPEAKER_01]: trajectory of our planet in certain areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've got to pull together as a
community and an industry and figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: how we can grease the wheels to move this
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to see anybody lose money
anymore and I think we can avoid that by
[SPEAKER_01]: learning from the mistakes that have
happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just to add to the comments to all
these guys, maybe wrap it in a tidy bow
[SPEAKER_03]: because most of you probably certainly
weren't here when I first started this
[SPEAKER_03]: morning, but if you really do look at
cannabis being the genus and then
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else underneath it,
you have THC+, THC-, which includes
[SPEAKER_03]: molecular hemp, which is flavonoids,
terpenes, HHC, some of the miners,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you have THC+, which is delta A,
delta 9, THCA.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the regulated, unregulated,
the whole kit and caboodle, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a huge opportunity and I think
it's going to take some patience,
[SPEAKER_03]: some time, and a lot of data, whether it's
hemp derived THC, hemp derived CBD,
[SPEAKER_03]: CBC, or any some of these other things
coming from outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that being said, we'd like to have
this interactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have stayed so late for us,
so we'll throw it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hirsch, you can just speak up,
Hirsch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the regulatory model for hemp
has grown up in a very distinct way than
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulatory model for psychoactive
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my question is, do you envision the
regulatory model for the entire plant
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately resembling the world in which
you operate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that you advocate for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the last part of that question
is, if that's true, I'm curious how
[SPEAKER_00]: someone like Oliver thinks about that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's the world we're going to live in
in a decade or two, how does that impact
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that you think about investment?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just tell you what my personal belief
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the US, 21 plus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, 18 plus.
[SPEAKER_04]: 5% to 6% retail tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: GMP, EUGMP made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Call it a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it food guidelines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make it a food.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a commodity.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way we treat it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We treat it as a commodity.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sell, like I said, 42 of these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let people decide how they want to
consume it, just like a nutraceutical
[SPEAKER_04]: product or just like a food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also have a direct-to-consumer
company where we get to see the benefits
[SPEAKER_04]: of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Directly, and obviously, I have my clients
that I talk to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is how this medicine should be
accessed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why the hemp industry,
another fun fact, and this will come out
[SPEAKER_04]: in the next two months, the hemp industry
is bigger than the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hemp industry is about $40 to $50
billion in retail sales in the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis last year was $33 billion.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did that in four years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis has been around for 14 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're growing at three, four times the
pace.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the Florida statistics came out,
too, for the medical stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was 250 million milligrams are
consumed last week.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sell that every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it kind of just shows you the scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: It shows you the size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing is my chemist does a better
job of explaining this, but the reality is
[SPEAKER_04]: the demand's going to outpace what you can
grow for weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp's easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just what's going to happen as
these markets do open up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's necessary, essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Oliver, I think the question was to
you, too, on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so with regards to regulations,
we never make bets on regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've all probably got a bit
overexcited at the start, thinking that
[SPEAKER_02]: certain things are going to happen,
especially in the US and also now with
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our view now is that we operate only
within the regulatory frameworks that are
[SPEAKER_02]: in place and don't put any money behind
anything that relies on regulatory change
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to affect that business model.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, Brett, sounds like you're
in a very nice situation over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hats off to you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I suppose what we look at in
terms of investment is also much more on
[SPEAKER_02]: the medical and pharmaceutical side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that takes us a little further away
from the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we look at anything that affects the
endocannabinoid system, be that
[SPEAKER_02]: phytocannabinoid or synthetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a sense, that constrains what we
look at from the broader cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective because we need we don't
typically look at producers, but rather
[SPEAKER_02]: look at IP-rich businesses that are
typically developing assets through
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, a very structured, pre-existing
regulatory framework where we know the
[SPEAKER_02]: risks to an extent that we can,
we know the costs, and we know what the
[SPEAKER_02]: prize is at the end of the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to add to that, Hirsh, so again,
we're a lead sponsor, Benzinga,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I got up on the stage and talked about
Delta-8, and you do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Benzinga is really all about MSOs,
LPs, TH, what we call again, THC plus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought I might get burned at the
stake, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a month later, we go to CanMed,
and you're at CanMed, and it's all about
[SPEAKER_03]: science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I learned in the fact that I didn't
know, and that's the cool thing about this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, you're always learning new
stuff, that there was a guy in the US who
[SPEAKER_03]: was actually studying Delta-8 years in
1942, much sooner, what, 20 years more
[SPEAKER_03]: than 20 years, than Rafi Mishulam,
who had found THC or Delta-9.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the main point I wanna make is this
is all about innovation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way the world works,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you wanna try to get in front of
innovation, guess what, you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_03]: run over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sorry, but that's where this
industry's going, whether you like it or
[SPEAKER_03]: not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of these MSOs don't like it,
and it's where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think the whole division between
hemp and cannabis, which is the same
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, I think will eventually fall away,
because to separate this plant into two
[SPEAKER_01]: different dimensions, just based on THC
level, I think is very naive, because
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately, I think where it needs to be
regulated is actually at what the product
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be used for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, our medical farms in South
Africa cultivate flour, and they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: incinerate the leaves and the soil,
stalks, I mean, this makes no logical
[SPEAKER_01]: sense at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise, we have a lot of rural farmers
who have been cultivating for hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: years, and we are looking at creating
special zones where they don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: specific licenses, and the flour goes one
way, and the stalks and the leaves go
[SPEAKER_01]: another way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's eventually where we'll
see it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this whole 0.2% for hemp is just a
load of bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make any logical sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that is eventually,
that those lines will start to dissipate,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it'll be based on what the actual
plant is being used for, as opposed to its
[SPEAKER_01]: THC level.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just an opinion we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in a government Pakeesa last week,
and there were 100 delegates all debating
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are also trying to be innovative as
a developing economy to figure out how we
[SPEAKER_01]: can work within our environment and our
different sort of technicalities and
[SPEAKER_01]: processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that we've been
trying to figure out over the last few
[SPEAKER_01]: months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim, do you have any question that you'd
like the panel?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I can give you more stats.
[SPEAKER_04]: Florida's 6.9 billion retail market,
and then we just did Texas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Texas is a 3.3 billion dollar retail
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Texas is awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing with that hemp?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're smoking it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so there's, you know, we derive 42
cannabinoids from the hemp plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot of them are quite psychoactive,
yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So vapes, gummies, whatever, you can buy,
you can get high at something you buy at
[SPEAKER_04]: the gas station now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We take CBD, we isomerize it into Delta 8,
and that's legal federally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cannabinoid derived from the hemp
plant is the legal definition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we take hemp, we isolate the CBD out,
and then we use it to convert it to
[SPEAKER_04]: another cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you do a chemical conversion?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, isomerization, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so you do a chemical conversion of
that, and put it back in, and then people
[SPEAKER_07]: get high gas stations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Short answer, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost anywhere that's a U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: based place that hasn't banned it,
which is, you know, west coast
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially, you can go into smoke shops
for sure, but about 25% of gas stations
[SPEAKER_04]: carry it, just, you know, not large like
Exxon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, absolutely, it's 90% of our
sales.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's essentially the new cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, people use it for medicine,
obviously, as we all know, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's actually pure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we actually, you know, isolate
molecules to where they're pure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, terpenes have been known to
be carcinogens, for example, we just make
[SPEAKER_04]: pure molecules.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's probably actually safer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isomerization's a pretty well-known
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pharmaceuticals, you know, we do
hydrogenation, isomerization, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: your butter's hydrogenated essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are common practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are all phyto-cannabinoids also,
so they're found in the plant,
[SPEAKER_07]: we just have to scale them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people re-add in the terpenes,
like a company like True Terpenes,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a Goliath company now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much people can formulate whatever
you want, you know, add 20% CBN into your
[SPEAKER_04]: Delta-8 vape.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you got an indica, add 20% THCV in,
now you got a sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And another thing I guess I'll say is,
we've expedited the cannabis science by
[SPEAKER_04]: probably two decades, just because of what
we've been able to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, cannabis companies typically
sell CBN, THCV if they're special,
[SPEAKER_04]: and Delta-9 THC, like I said, our company
sells 42 cannabinoids, and these are all
[SPEAKER_04]: over the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people out there would like to
have Jim join us on stage?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, come on, come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little ignorant to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am, I'm a little ignorant to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there is a lot of cannabis in the
audience.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really stupid about hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just know that when the hemp boom came
in Oregon and California, it was like
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody, their brother and the cartel
were growing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And within a year and a half, everybody
lost everything, every convention that had
[SPEAKER_06]: the CBD in it, and they didn't show up the
next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the one gold rush I didn't go into
that I went, holy shit, I was smart for
[SPEAKER_06]: the first time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now you're taking that hemp business
and creating really a business to get
[SPEAKER_04]: high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're taking all that crop and we're
converting it to Delta-8 essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't want to introduce myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't have to guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they don't guess, fuck them out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're growing a tremendous amount of
hemp in Africa?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I don't, we don't actually make
the CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so you're a consultant.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I own the company.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a distributor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're a distributor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we sold 6.6 metric tons last
month.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll probably do eight tons this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not a farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to get involved in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, of course you don't want to get
involved in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like the part that makes money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want the safe thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you want the safe thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for farm, for example, we on a monthly
basis, roughly 600,000 pounds gets
[SPEAKER_04]: consumed indirectly through us.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got too many fucking numbers for me in
a row, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is what I do for a living.
[SPEAKER_06]: Too many numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Too many numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm simple.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like one plus one is two.
[SPEAKER_06]: 250 million and 260 trillion and CBD and
2BC and 600,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I'm being sold some with all
those numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just give me one plus one.
[SPEAKER_06]: One plus one is you take the hemp plant,
you fuck with it and people get high.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we make a shit ton of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you make a shit ton of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not in it for the money.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm in the other business.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in the, I'm in the cannabis business
that sells recreational and adult use and
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm in a business that doesn't make any
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just, it's the same thing,
but we don't have restriction.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, you know, I know it's a
bitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get wire.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get wire transfers every day and my
money's at bank of America.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the thing I always throw some
numbers in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not tell you a wire transfer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got one today for 250 euros transfers
into one of the dollars yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did 380,000 in sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: Euros, dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some euros in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually probably higher than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably about 50,000 euros.
[SPEAKER_06]: See?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew you had some more numbers in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, let's get some multiples going
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mean to fuck with you,
but it's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, this is great now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're talking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I have a joint in my pocket from
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have a bag of D eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you call it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Th eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're actually Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can give you a bag of Delta eight or a
joint for Morgan.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you want to smoke?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon grows the second best weed in the
world.
[SPEAKER_06]: They bet the best weed in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, just, you know, so it's,
it's a working man's weed is what you're
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gas stations and it's a, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was describing, I think we we've
converted a lot of people that would never
[SPEAKER_04]: go into a medical dispensary in a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of these states where we're big,
there, there aren't that access anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, and this is a Florida is a
medical state too, but I was walking down
[SPEAKER_04]: Deval street in a Key West Florida,
and there's three dispensaries all shut
[SPEAKER_04]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's about 25 stores selling Delta
eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a mile stores, what selling Delta
eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Delta eight guys just crushed the
med.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to be brought over to this Delta
eight thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, for some reason, I welcome to chat
about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I, I, I'm just, I'm not there yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not there yet because there were some
stats that I heard, but I don't remember
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I'm not like you 40 billion,
40 billion in Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was legislation that they were
fighting about trying to keep the Delta
[SPEAKER_06]: eight out because of some health issues
that were sprung up from the usage,
[SPEAKER_06]: but that was, I can't even quote it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't have the credibility here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get lots of propaganda against us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some anti propaganda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes from the cannabis side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So usually when we speak comes from my
side, is that what you say?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're right because that's what I
heard was from a grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They truly, truly spent $10 million
lobbying and we kicked their ass in
[SPEAKER_04]: Florida up and down the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, so there is a fight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Between my side and your side.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why here's the tension.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And within five minutes you'll be able to
take bets because we'll be wrestling right
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make a prediction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the fight will be over.
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the irony.
[SPEAKER_06]: June of next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the irony in this discussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't grow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of, in terms of what you're
saying, where, where do you see things in
[SPEAKER_01]: the next five, 10 years in terms of hemp
and cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, how do you see the market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Shifting based on what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me do the numbers for him.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you explain it to 57 to say a 24,
20 times 20, 26 million, 26 million Delta,
[SPEAKER_06]: 20, 12, four point six.
[SPEAKER_06]: I expect cannabis distribution as much as
I expect cannabis 280 tax law distribution
[SPEAKER_06]: capital.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go right back to the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: 1.6.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make me sound like a genius.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are a fucking genius, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are a genius.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not as smart as you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I had your shoes, I'd be better
looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like my shoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like the shoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at my shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like David's better, but I'm working on
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was curled under.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even do it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, in the next year, I expect the fight
to be over and I expect hemp to win.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there's some things that I won't
discuss on stage, but, um, things look
[SPEAKER_04]: very good for hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the use a different ball game,
but we do lobby here or we do I'll be in
[SPEAKER_04]: Prague tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: For my association.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, we'll see what happens there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually supposed to make a
decision tomorrow on HHC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think at some point, like the FDA
will catch up because it is psychoactive?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're, we're, we're talking to the FDA and
they're, they actually, well, they told us
[SPEAKER_04]: they want to regulate it our way.
[SPEAKER_04]: They told us that they want to regulate
Delta eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want, they want to regulate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we don't expect to get jeweled,
which if people aren't familiars,
[SPEAKER_04]: FDA came out and just banned jewel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a big concern of ours actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're in discussions with the FDA and,
and the federal government and state.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was meeting with the governor of
Kentucky four days ago and I go,
[SPEAKER_04]: I need, I need seeds in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're working on the economic
incentives to help the farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so we are, so if you want to move to
Kentucky, I can help you out, but I need a
[SPEAKER_04]: one point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to ask what I want.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm going right for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: A hemp farm in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the largest hemp states,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my understanding is I don't know
about acres, but I think it is the senator
[SPEAKER_06]: in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Governor Beshear is who I was referencing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm meeting with, you know,
a bunch of his staff members, but we're,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're trying to get as much hemp in the
ground as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we expect demand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we, I, I, we turned down business
all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't even keep up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that I knew that I read that on
your, your ad.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't take your business.
[SPEAKER_06]: We turned down business all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even need to fucking be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did the FDA give you any reasons as to why
they want to regulate it or how they were
[SPEAKER_02]: going to go about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't, I mean, I probably shouldn't
even be speaking about this, but I wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: the one that had the conversation,
but, um, they, they just want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The FDA is not going to come out and say,
Hey, Delta, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just want it regulated at the federal
level with more guidelines in the FAR
[SPEAKER_04]: bill, essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I'm giving out all the secrets
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, since now we have Jim Belushi on the
stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have, with regards to the title of
our talk, your thoughts on the winners and
[SPEAKER_03]: your experience the next couple of years?
[SPEAKER_06]: Winners who will be the winners and the
losers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Countries, companies, technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: It all sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, uh, it's the only way you really can
win in any of these categories is if
[SPEAKER_06]: you're driven with purpose and you have to
be able to sacrifice all kinds of shit to
[SPEAKER_06]: be committed to your purpose.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of those things you have to
sacrifice is money.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if your purpose is embedded in your
body and your heart, you can be a winner
[SPEAKER_06]: no matter what.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my purpose is about the healing
benefits of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I see people, veterans that have
PTSD that we're giving, given a bottle of
[SPEAKER_06]: 600 Oxycontin to help them and we move
them over to cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: that changes everything for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I may lose money on my farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I can afford it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most, a lot of the farmers aren't.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really struggling.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's easier for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm luxurious to be able to keep on
purpose.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my purpose is about healing.
[SPEAKER_06]: My purpose is about, you know,
taking people.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I loved with the hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I saw these children in Colorado
Springs, you know, there was a little
[SPEAKER_06]: place called the realm of care and they
had about 30, 40 children there varying
[SPEAKER_06]: from age from five to 14 that were having
so many seizures in a, in a day that the
[SPEAKER_06]: married couple, it's hard for them to stay
married because the mother is in the
[SPEAKER_06]: bedroom with the son watching for the
seizures, you know, taking the son into
[SPEAKER_06]: hospice with 14 different kinds of
medication.
[SPEAKER_06]: She is never in her husband's bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their relations have gone to zero.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this family, because of this disease is
about to split this family up and to see
[SPEAKER_06]: what a little CBD oil did for that child.
[SPEAKER_06]: It saved the child.
[SPEAKER_06]: It saved the family.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think cannabis has a multitude of
purposes and it's all driven to helping
[SPEAKER_06]: families, which is where we live,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of guys smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think you're a natural winner.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in this industry, I don't know
if you're the best businessman.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I'm not, but I feel good every day
when people are healed or, I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a strain that's not hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cherry pie it's called and it's got
like a 19% THC and about 3% terpenes,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, some limonene in it,
you know, and it's, it's, I am a
[SPEAKER_06]: lightweight.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I took a hit, one hit and came
downstairs and saw my wife and everything
[SPEAKER_06]: she said was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't believe how beautiful my wife
was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I called cherry pie the marriage
counselor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, cannabis heals so many things
besides, besides helps with cancer and
[SPEAKER_06]: seizures and backaches and sleeplessness,
hopelessness, it helps with hopelessness.
[SPEAKER_06]: And can help with your partner or your
wife too.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just much better than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the interesting stat and I'll talk
about it tomorrow because I do have one
[SPEAKER_06]: stat.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_06]: The state of Illinois, they paid $478
million in state taxes, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: industry in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_06]: That year they paid $278 million in taxes
for liquor.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot more bars and liquor stores
than there are dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the war on drugs is still continuing
with the over taxation and the over
[SPEAKER_06]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what this gentleman is talking about
is moving all out on the side of that,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is cool, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's medically motivated,
I think it's even super cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know the medical benefits of
the Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to cut everybody off, but we're out
of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time to start the party.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll talk all day, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll talk all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thursday I'm talking, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thursday you're talking and also you're
having a meet and greet in the reception
[SPEAKER_05]: lobby.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it for Jim Belushi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look,
[SPEAKER_05]: just like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you are, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you are, man.
