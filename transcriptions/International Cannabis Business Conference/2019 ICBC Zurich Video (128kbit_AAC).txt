[SPEAKER_00]: To me, Europe represents the vanguard of
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States and Canada,
we have a more developed industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, just getting started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the opportunities here and the market
here are enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful to be here with a whole
group of people from all around the world
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in furthering their involvement
in the cannabis industry and meeting new
[SPEAKER_00]: people, making new connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful to be here with a whole
bunch of white people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like-minded, kindred spirits interested in
advancing the cannabis industry globally.
[SPEAKER_02]: ICBC Zurich essentially is the first large
international cannabis conference that's
[SPEAKER_02]: ever happened here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And based on the local programs,
there's a lot of opportunities for
[SPEAKER_02]: producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But knowing all the international markets,
how they relate with each other,
[SPEAKER_02]: how pharmaceutical import, export,
production standards need to happen,
[SPEAKER_02]: these are the things that a lot of
companies and countries and investors need
[SPEAKER_02]: to know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to actually have a good source of
information from people who've been in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry for 10 plus years and seen
Canadian programs, U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: programs, 19 other countries importing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here mostly raising capital,
deploying capital, and then also finding
[SPEAKER_02]: new projects to start and invest into.
[SPEAKER_02]: ICBC has now done a glorious job in Berlin
for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Spain, in Switzerland, in Canada and
the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that one moment that what's happening
in the local market with what's happening
[SPEAKER_02]: in the international market get to meet
and the opportunities that happen here are
[SPEAKER_02]: once in a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Marco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run a company called Highlife Media.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're located in Zurich, Switzerland,
exactly where this conference is happening
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself and my company Highlife Media,
we attended a lot of different events in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry and the ICBC really
stood out so far because...
[SPEAKER_01]: The networking that you can do here is
worth a lot more than what the tickets are
[SPEAKER_01]: costing so I think you should definitely
make sure to attend if you want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: something done in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ICBC is a proud sponsor of Highlife
Media.
We're a proud sponsor of Highlife Media.
