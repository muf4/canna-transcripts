[SPEAKER_00]: In many ways, THC, the psychoactive
cannabinoid in the plant, has been the
[SPEAKER_00]: most famous one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CBD is really helping lead the way,
both medicinally and mainstreaming
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next panel is on CBD in Europe and
beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm introducing the moderator,
and she'll take it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call her a living legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's had plenty of experience in the
cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's now the top consultant for cannabis
businesses in LA and California in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: While she's here, she's multitasking,
pulling off major deals with Damian Marley
[SPEAKER_00]: and Amoeba Records, starting their
dispensary called High Fidelity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please give a warm welcome for Ms. Mary
Patton.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gosh, they too.
[SPEAKER_08]: This panel is on CBD in Europe and beyond.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Mary Patton.
[SPEAKER_08]: As Anthony mentioned, I'm a cannabis
industry consultant, but a very longtime
[SPEAKER_08]: activist.
[SPEAKER_08]: I call my company Newtopia because like
you, I always believed that a legal
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis marketplace would make the world
a better place.
[SPEAKER_08]: But today, I am joined by a very esteemed
panel of industry experts who are gonna
[SPEAKER_08]: tell you all about cannabidiol,
the industry that's an exploding sector.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was looking at some of the statistics
recently, and back in 2010, Jared,
[SPEAKER_08]: do you remember?
[SPEAKER_08]: We were trying to get the CBD industry off
to a start, and everybody thought we were
[SPEAKER_08]: completely crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now I was looking at statistics,
and by some industry experts are
[SPEAKER_08]: anticipating that this is gonna be a $3
billion industry just in the CBD sector
[SPEAKER_08]: alone by 2021.
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I want to start
by hearing some of your observations.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, actually, I'm gonna start going
online.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me a little bit about who you are.
[SPEAKER_08]: What you're doing in the industry,
and specifically what you're doing with
[SPEAKER_08]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I want to...
[SPEAKER_02]: The quality of this conference is
wonderful, and I've met a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm really happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to say this, and at the end,
if anyone wants to ask me a question in
[SPEAKER_02]: German, that's okay, but I'd like to say
the rest in English.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm Jamie Pearson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with Bang Corporation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're one of the larger brands in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a presence in California,
Washington, New Mexico, Illinois,
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida, Puerto Rico, Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could go on and on, and what I do is I'm
in charge of global operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are here to connect with Europe,
and specifically to bring our finished CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: goods to Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have full spectrum CBD and CBD isolate
products in the form of gourmet chocolate,
[SPEAKER_02]: in vapes, in gum, mouth sprays,
a whole array of products, and we sell
[SPEAKER_02]: them to the Gro√ühandel, so we're more of a
wholesaler rather than a retailer,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's what I'm here for, is to
connect with people from the EU who are
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for finished CBD goods,
but we also import bulk CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm doing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Jared Berry, and actually Bang
was the first sale we made of CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a million dollar sale in 2011,
and this is, again, when Mary said people
[SPEAKER_04]: thought we were crazy, that was a big leap
for the owner of Bang to take.
[SPEAKER_04]: People thought, why would anybody want
CBD?
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't even get you high, and I
remember every investor meeting we went
[SPEAKER_04]: to, that was the first thing they'd say.
[SPEAKER_04]: But look at it now, and it really is
incredible, not only the industry and how
[SPEAKER_04]: it's booming and the amount of people that
are getting into the industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: and able to make a good living and then do
something that's exciting, because it
[SPEAKER_04]: really does make a difference in people's
lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see it every day with testimonials
coming in on humans and animals,
[SPEAKER_04]: and my story starts back in 2009 with a
company called Cannabank, and we did a
[SPEAKER_04]: reverse merger with Medical Marijuana Inc.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was there that I discovered that CBD
may be an incredible molecule,
[SPEAKER_04]: just through some patents that the United
States Health Department had pulled,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so I left there, and started a company
called Biosynthesis Farmer Group,
[SPEAKER_04]: BSPG, which is actually here in the UK,
it's in Europe, and we do extraction,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we were the first to industrialize the
isolate in a purified manner that was
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical grade, and bring it into
the marketplace there in the United
[SPEAKER_04]: States, and now globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started a company from there,
where we were taking the isolate and
[SPEAKER_04]: turning it into end consumer brands called
Isodile, and we just went public in 2017,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's now a $400 million company that
focuses solely on CBD and CBD products,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then in the midst of that,
we also started a company called CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: Naturals, and that company takes the
cannabidiol and then uses technologies
[SPEAKER_04]: like nano emulsification and amplification
to be able to put it into water and reduce
[SPEAKER_04]: the amount needed and increase the effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I'm focused 100% on that company,
and in Europe we're trying to find
[SPEAKER_04]: partners that we can manufacture with here
locally, so that our products and our
[SPEAKER_04]: product brands can be produced here,
and then distributed throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, hello, my name is Emanuel Kozian.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in this industry now for nearly 20
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We began with something totally different
with media, because nobody was talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about the benefits of cannabis itself,
so we founded a newspaper for consumers
[SPEAKER_05]: and for non-consumers to bring out
information about the wonderful benefits
[SPEAKER_05]: of cannabis itself, and I'm a happy guy
because we did a lot of projects last 20
[SPEAKER_05]: years, and one of the projects we started
two years ago was, it was not our like
[SPEAKER_05]: invention.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a look on US and have seen what's
going on there, and we discovered this CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: market can be a reality in Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we started to figure out, could this
be legal in Germany?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found out yes, so let's do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really our pleasure to really work
with the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: We love to work with the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: We love organic farming.
[SPEAKER_05]: We love to transfer the product itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more we can of the plant to the people
who need it and who want to use it,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we are way of course to a total
legalization in Germany as well,
[SPEAKER_05]: but let's say one of the step stones is
definitely the CBD market, and so we are
[SPEAKER_05]: happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We began two years ago, and I'm happy also
about today.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, because the CBD future is
happening just now on the ICPC here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We meet here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bank company has a new distributor
here in Germany, and I'm very happy about
[SPEAKER_05]: this future to happen now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is really exciting because,
you know, when Jared, you started
[SPEAKER_08]: biosynthesis and did your first sale to
bang.
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_08]: 2011.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's 2018 and seven years.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've just seen a massive explosion of
this industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's gone not just around the U.S.,
but worldwide.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to get some of your observations
and find out from you, like, what's
[SPEAKER_08]: changed since you started this industry?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you start, it's been seven
years.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot has happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: So give me a sense of how things have
changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are some of the trends that you've
seen?
[SPEAKER_08]: And what are some of the key market
drivers that are really, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: influencing this massive growth?
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone want to speak to that?
[SPEAKER_08]: You can kind of, I'll jump in whenever you
have something you want to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the biggest changes is the price
per kilo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was like $60,000 U.S.,
and now it's under 10, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: in a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's definitely been a big change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's great, too, because it's easy
to access from the patient side point of
[SPEAKER_04]: view.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're, you know, they're able to take
higher doses, able to make it more
[SPEAKER_04]: affordable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think some of the trends are really
we like to look at CBD, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: almost kind of like sugar.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you look at Coca-Cola,
they branded sugar.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can run into any store and grab a
sugar packet and run out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't think you're stealing something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's branded so well in
Coca-Cola.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you look at how big that company is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We think that the real future is going to
be in the end consumer brands and those
[SPEAKER_04]: that do a good job with their branding and
then their way of taking the product and
[SPEAKER_04]: making it work even better than if it was
just taken in an oil format.
[SPEAKER_04]: So adding value adds like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the term of a delivery process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the big observations that
I've made is that the CBD market has been
[SPEAKER_02]: the entree for a lot of people into the
THC market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll use my own mother as an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had a hip replacement.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was clean and sober, would not touch
marijuana for pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the opiates were not helping her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, Mom, just try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anecdotally, so I have that story
personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm saying is there's a lot of
fear still around using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a stigma around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the next wave of what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've reached the tipping point in the
United States, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tipping point's coming around the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But CBD products are a safe way,
safe from people who are afraid of getting
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gateway into people having a
comfort level with this miracle plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: is really benefiting people from anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depression and pain and epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's helped so many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really seeing CBD make a
difference in people's lives, but also
[SPEAKER_02]: helping the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, I'm seeing that trend where
some of the battling between the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: people and the CBD people is going away
because they're seeing us as being a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really must add exactly this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: The stigmata, still it has not changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to add my own mother refused a
CBD product some months ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even she's using morphine in the same
minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even I'm working on this for many,
many years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could not persuade her.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how to express it's no success.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really like losing something.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other side, I see in our CBD shop,
where we see the customers, we have new
[SPEAKER_05]: customers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Older one.
[SPEAKER_05]: The females are coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even they're buying for the husband.
[SPEAKER_05]: But ladies, 70, 80 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we go to, for example, we have been
in Warsaw.
[SPEAKER_05]: People with young children in the buggy
came by and asked how much CBD I have to
[SPEAKER_05]: use for this and this disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the drama is I cannot tell about it
because in Germany, if I'm not a
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmacologist or a doctor, I'm not
allowed to tell about any consequences of
[SPEAKER_05]: taking a substance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Better not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the other trend I'm seeing is
banking is changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about this when we were getting
ready for the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Credit card processing is the biggest
issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're starting to see that loosen up
where banking and credit card companies
[SPEAKER_02]: are starting to understand that in the EU,
for example, you have to have less than 2%
[SPEAKER_02]: THC for your product to be legal if it's
hemp derived.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the US, it's less than 3% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the banking companies are
understanding is, okay, this is not
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this isn't the federally scheduled
drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might be able to let these companies
have credit card processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know you have credit card processing,
and I'm in the process of getting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more expensive, but it's full
disclosure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not hiding anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another entree into the world,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that might help,
and we just executed an exclusive with a
[SPEAKER_04]: partner now called Immunag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in India, they went in the jungle and
found feral cannabis growing with humulus
[SPEAKER_04]: plants, hops plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And started to do tests on all these hops
plants and found some with THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they found some with CBD only.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they then started to grow that in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now years later, we have pure oil
forms and isolate form.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes with beta-carotene and humulene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we go to the bank with the
humulus-based CBD, or like Facebook,
[SPEAKER_04]: for instance, who has closed down any
advertising capability for CBD companies
[SPEAKER_04]: and hemp companies, the doors open back up
when it's hops-based.
[SPEAKER_08]: Will you explain a little bit about the
humulus CBD and what that is for people
[SPEAKER_08]: who might not be familiar?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cannabidiol is cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've gotten it from marijuana or
hemp, and in America, there's been an
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting bit of a war between the
marijuana companies and then so-called
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people were saying marijuana-based CBD
is better than hemp-based CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And none of that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD is CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can find it in another plant,
it's also the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in humulus, which is I guess a
technical name for hops, and the doctor
[SPEAKER_04]: that we work with hates it when we call it
hops, even though it is hops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's so many varieties of hops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the stuff that they use for beer
doesn't yield CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is humulus, and it's not hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are able to extract now in a large,
massive way.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same thing that we've been talking
about with cannabis, hemp, the CBD that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're extracting is the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we really have found,
which I think is a new thing for the
[SPEAKER_04]: future, everybody may have heard of the
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you heard of full spectrum entourage
effect?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's like 500 ingredients in
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's so many things that could
be helping or even hurting.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we've found is that beta-carotene,
which is a terpene, it's also now called a
[SPEAKER_04]: dietary cannabinoid because it's in our
diets.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's in black pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in eucalyptus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, with the beta-carotene mixed with
the CBD, the CB2 receptor is able to do
[SPEAKER_04]: its job even better because it's a modular
between the immune system and the nervous
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why we see it affects so many
things so positively.
[SPEAKER_04]: It increases that communication.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, CBD is actually a blocker to things
that block the CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So something that's blocking its ability,
that CBD goes in and defends that and
[SPEAKER_04]: stops that blocker.
[SPEAKER_04]: But beta-carotene accentuates it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you would combine them,
you know, I've been working with CBD so
[SPEAKER_04]: long, and I've seen how great it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's just been a little bit of
like, I kind of wished it was going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: a miracle, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when you combine it with
beta-carotene, we've seen the best at,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you have 100 milligrams of CBD,
60 milligrams of beta-carotene.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, 6 to 10, so to speak there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, 6 milligrams to 10 milligrams is
an incredible combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the entourage effect is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something you should definitely try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like, when I'm listening to him
and I'm learning something new,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking, okay, the next leap then is
educating the customer because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have to have your population
understand what he just said and why they
[SPEAKER_02]: want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why that particular product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what's happening is there is a
lot of people going out now and seeking
[SPEAKER_02]: that education.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's another opportunity for people,
you know, like Emmy, who are providing the
[SPEAKER_02]: information through their media outlets
and things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I feel like when I heard
Henry speak on the first day and the
[SPEAKER_02]: panels throughout the day is that what's
incumbent upon us in this room is to start
[SPEAKER_02]: educating because we have reached the
tipping point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's time to come out of the closet
and say, hey, I'm a cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a cannabis business person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next tipping point is everybody
coming out of the closet and saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, this is an industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love hearing, I love coming to these
things and learning something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in the CBD world and I'm like,
wow, he just blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, who blew my mind was actually Mary
Patton in 2010.
[SPEAKER_04]: She says, you know, in Ireland,
and I don't know if this is actually true.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never looked it up, but I'm hoping it
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, in Ireland, there was this
outbreak of something called scurvy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was not really a disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was because of the vitamin C
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so really, she said, you know,
if you look at vitamin C, it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: nutritional necessity that we have to
have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, bad things happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she goes, I believe that phyto
cannabinoids are a nutritional necessity
[SPEAKER_04]: that we haven't had in our diet for a very
long time because of it being banned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas when you look before the 1930s,
it grew wild on seven continents.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, animals ate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it was just, it was in our
bodies through ways of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: other animals eating it and us eating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it hasn't been.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can look at, since then,
look at the neurological diseases and the
[SPEAKER_04]: things that have just, I mean,
increased, you know, Alzheimer's,
[SPEAKER_04]: ADHD, dementia.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, and so that gets to the
point then, you know, when we're talking
[SPEAKER_08]: about how patients or, you know,
even if you're not a patient, access
[SPEAKER_08]: product.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, CBD is sold sometimes in
pharmaceutical outlets, sometimes in
[SPEAKER_08]: lifestyle outlets.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are your customers accessing your
products most often?
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, are you able to get it into
the pharmacies here in Germany,
[SPEAKER_08]: for example, right now?
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to hear a little bit more
about your target markets and how they're
[SPEAKER_08]: accessing your products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very happy about this question because
it's really connected to what you just
[SPEAKER_05]: told.
[SPEAKER_05]: You made something wonderful for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You made some recommendation how to use
it, which I'm not allowed to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it could be against the
competition law.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has nothing to do with CBD,
but with the pharmaceutical competition
[SPEAKER_05]: law.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one of our problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even I have some information.
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot forward it really one to one to
my customer.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a goal for everybody who is in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And patients, doctors, dispensaries,
whoever to multiply the information.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this moment, when I'm on a fair and a
client is asking me really the core
[SPEAKER_05]: questions, I cannot tell him honestly more
than have a look on the American pages.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a little bit crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what to say, I'm not really allowed to
explain it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your slogan should be Google it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but I know exactly because you have
now like a very big market and you're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing some research and there is some
evidence and you have some recommendations
[SPEAKER_05]: and you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's the information which which
we need here, but we are not allowed to
[SPEAKER_05]: talk really open about it or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not when you want to make really the sales
in a legal way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You asked me about the distribution
points.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very, very happy because this changes
a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year on the ICPC, we have been
discussing about a CBD legal globally in
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we can we sell it or not?
[SPEAKER_05]: We answered that question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, yes, we already sold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's evident, but there are many
distribution ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are mainly selling in this moment to
our core clients, which are mostly grow
[SPEAKER_05]: shops, head shops, smart shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not our goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our goal is, of course, to be in the
middle of the society.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are attending to to ecological shops,
to to auger farming shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what is, of course, like the crown of
the business in this point are the
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not easy, but it's it's possible to
to receive like a pharmaceutical number.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm also happy to to announce today
from the 1st of May, we have an official
[SPEAKER_05]: product in cooperation with with our
partner from Poland, which is making
[SPEAKER_05]: really great CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to Jacek if you are here and
thanks to Hempoland from Poland.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got registered this for the
pharmacies with a real pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_05]: number and as a food supplement.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can you can buy it with without any
prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our biggest very similar to what Emmy
said.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have dispensaries in the US,
head shops, vape shops, e-cigarette shops
[SPEAKER_02]: are big on carrying CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of lifestyle shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a lot of people from yoga
retreats and places that are wellness
[SPEAKER_02]: oriented contact us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, we have our bulk CBD
buyers that I would say make up a good 50
[SPEAKER_02]: percent of our business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where we're selling.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had a challenge in the US as well
for the legal compliancy side of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the DEA there, which is going to
be really enforcing the drug control and
[SPEAKER_04]: whether or not this is a scheduled drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have the FDA, which is the
Food and Drug Administration, who's really
[SPEAKER_04]: governing more the labeling and the
claiming, which we could be kind of what
[SPEAKER_04]: you're talking about in terms of making a
claim or talking about it in a way that
[SPEAKER_04]: you can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so with the attorneys and the legal
expenses and the amount of money that's
[SPEAKER_04]: been put into that, there's been some
interesting things that have happened
[SPEAKER_04]: along the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe it'd be good to share really
quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've found ways of labeling instead
of putting CBD or cannabidiol on the
[SPEAKER_04]: label, calling it out as an ingredient.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a chemical name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp oil is really what it is when you
take it from hemp and you have haven't
[SPEAKER_04]: derived it synthetically.
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminds me of something, and you
probably have something similar here
[SPEAKER_04]: because most things are always the same,
just worded differently, but we have a
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop 65 in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's anything that's known to cause
cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's something added to a product
and it is on the Prop 65 list,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to label a Prop 65 warning on the
bottle that it's in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And an example was mercine, because
mercine's on that list, which is a
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually a terpene that's in cannabis
and in hops and in mangoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you put mercine in a product and you
put mercine in the ingredients list,
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd have to put that warning.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if you were to take mangoes and
extract mercine from it, in fact,
[SPEAKER_04]: you were to just keep extracting and
throwing away everything except for just
[SPEAKER_04]: that mercine, until the point where it was
99% mercine, and then put on the
[SPEAKER_04]: ingredients list mango extract,
because it still is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do that, and you wouldn't be
having to put a Prop 65 warning on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So think of that when you think of hemp
oil and extracting CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD from hemp, and then using hemp oil in
the ingredients list, and then find clever
[SPEAKER_04]: ways of putting CBD on there, like cash
before delivery.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: But CBD.
CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: CB different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vitamin C, vitamin B12, and D3.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vitamin CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's things you can do when you're
talking about a lifestyle brand,
[SPEAKER_04]: because there's going to be the
pharmaceutical clinical trial dosage
[SPEAKER_04]: testing route, which you'll have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very expensive, but it's worth
going into.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can do those trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do that now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get into an OTC, like
over-the-counter situation like you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's the lifestyle brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those brands are going to be
scrutinized based on these claims and
[SPEAKER_04]: labels.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you should be smart when you label
those things, so you don't have to take
[SPEAKER_04]: them off the shelf at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a practical point of what he's talking
about, we put all of our products on eBay,
[SPEAKER_02]: our hemp-derived CBD products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did a little experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had them listed all with CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had them all listed with hemp
oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the CBDs got shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: eBay took them off their site.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of our hemp oil products remained.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an example of being smart about
your labeling.
[SPEAKER_08]: Labeling is a big challenge, because
there's so much that you can't say about
[SPEAKER_08]: your product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's obviously restrictions
and rules.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really confusing for the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what you can say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Phytocannabinoids.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's phytocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of things are considered a
phytocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the consumers don't know what
those are, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's this education process that
needs to happen, especially if you're a
[SPEAKER_08]: brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to open up for some questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone have any questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one back there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a mic?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you speak loud, maybe?
Check,
check.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it up for our CBD panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really nice, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the great podium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking at the European market from
your point of view, would you enter the
[SPEAKER_01]: market with all your products,
or would you go for a certain category
[SPEAKER_01]: first?
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you approach it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who would you direct your question to?
[SPEAKER_01]: To all of you, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bang, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you say the UK market, specifically?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the European as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think all of our products would be,
and I'm not just saying that because I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: representing the brand, but I think
because they're hemp-derived, and we have
[SPEAKER_02]: had success with them in the US because
the delivery methods are discreet,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning that you can put a pack of hemp
gum in your purse, and you don't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of ways, especially too if
you're having health issues, to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: eat a chocolate bar if you can't smoke is
a great way to get some of your dosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they all provide a different delivery
method, and I think they're all relevant
[SPEAKER_02]: in this market.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had some distributors, larger
distributors already.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in the marketplace, and some in
Switzerland, here in Germany, in the UK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've been really focusing,
number one, just the category,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't know exactly why, but I'm
going to guess because there's already a
[SPEAKER_04]: marketplace for it, but that's the whole
vape sector.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it seems to be that there's a lot of
head shops, and vaping is very popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: So having some great delivery systems,
maybe even some meter-dose vaping
[SPEAKER_04]: solutions that tell you a dosage amount on
some app or those type of things,
[SPEAKER_04]: disposable ones like that, and ones that
aren't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think would be something to have as a
low-hanging fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we've gotten a huge flux of
interest in beverages.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's an emulsification process with
other ingredients combined with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: From water to energy drinks to lemonades
and teas and coffees has been a big
[SPEAKER_04]: interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then gummies, and I would assume for
all ages, but there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: interest in gummies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you ask about Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 27 countries just in the European
Union, plus Switzerland, and plus another
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of markets around, which I would also
call European, and it's mission impossible
[SPEAKER_05]: to tell you the rules in each country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just at a breakfast time, I had a
discussion with a Swiss guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have very similar system, speaking
nearly the same language.
[SPEAKER_05]: And still, I would ask a lawyer before,
before doing it exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know exactly your question.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have really, from my side,
to focus might be on some products which
[SPEAKER_05]: are looking more serious because one of
the, there is, for example, in Germany,
[SPEAKER_05]: not a law forbidding you to sell isolates.
[SPEAKER_05]: But some of the isolates are looking,
please forgive me, but some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: isolates are looking like crystal meth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in some areas of Germany, it might
cause a visit of the police.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got taken to jail because they thought
it was crystal meth.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would not believe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so better take the products which are
looking might be more serious,
[SPEAKER_05]: more the way my grandma also would love
it, and then make your experience with
[SPEAKER_05]: European bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in each country, it's different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even in Germany, we have 16 states.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's another game in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another game in Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't try to cover all Europe at once.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too many languages, too many
translations, too many labels which are
[SPEAKER_05]: different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Concentrate might be first on the big
markets, or might be on the logical
[SPEAKER_05]: markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Netherlands, Holland is our
wonderful country to come in.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are quite liberal, but also they have
their own laws about many, many things.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have regulations since they begin to
open the first coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to take care about many
aspects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask a question, if you mind?
[SPEAKER_04]: In the US with the FDA, you can make a
product and then you can put it on the
[SPEAKER_04]: shelves and hope that you've done it right
based upon the guidelines that are
[SPEAKER_04]: presented.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just got to make sure that you've
done a good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can legally put it out and sell it
and distribute it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it different in Europe?
[SPEAKER_04]: In Europe, do you have to get a
registration prior to getting products
[SPEAKER_04]: distributed on shelves?
[SPEAKER_05]: The risk is on your side.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to take care about the risk
is on the side of the person who is the
[SPEAKER_05]: first one to buy from out of European
Union.
[SPEAKER_05]: This person overtakes the responsibility
this product is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: He can put it into his shelf without
registration, but overtakes the
[SPEAKER_05]: responsibility if something is wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I recommend, if you have any
possibility to register your product as
[SPEAKER_05]: water supplement or whatever, do it
because better, you have a classification
[SPEAKER_05]: for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a text number.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have all the accountancy done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And afterwards, you don't have any
unanswered question when a prosecutor
[SPEAKER_05]: might cross your way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we have time for one more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for introducing us into
the world of CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned the qualities of CBD for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The holistic aspect of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am really interested to get to know
how do you see the potential of the CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: discussion, starting maybe from the US on
a worldly level, to break the stigmata of
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana, cannabis, and what do you see
disconnect?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which responsibility comes within?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think first, it begs the natural
question when you're talking about the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between hemp derived and
cannabis or marijuana derived CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people don't even realize it's the
same plant, but a different plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, the education process
starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people go, oh, I buy hemp t-shirts,
and those are allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I buy hemp seeds at Costco or Aldi,
and that's allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they start making the
connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's really what is
happening, is that that basic core level
[SPEAKER_02]: with people who know nothing, it gives
them a comfort level to start having a
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's where it starts,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, too, it's going to start changing
even more.
[SPEAKER_04]: You look at vitamin B12.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now, from what I'm learning,
is that you can only really get that from
[SPEAKER_04]: red meat or synthetically made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even vegans are having a deficiency in
vitamin B12.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for a long time, I think CBD has been
associated with just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, we're able to extract it from
hops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it shouldn't really be just a cannabis
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you consume CBD, to say I consume
cannabis, I guess that's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also, you're consuming a
phytocannabinoid that's available in other
[SPEAKER_04]: species of plants that don't have that
stigma.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not sure if CBD should have that
stigma when it's non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no way to really overdose on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no risk of abuse.
[SPEAKER_04]: It shouldn't come with the stigma that THC
has given.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, I've always felt that what it's
doing is it's providing an entry point to
[SPEAKER_08]: start educating the consumer on the
endocannabinoid system in general.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an easy topic for people to start to
learn how the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_08]: works.
[SPEAKER_08]: So once they get comfortable with CBD from
hemp and realize that this is helping them
[SPEAKER_08]: regulate pain or inflammation or their
immune response in some kind of way,
[SPEAKER_08]: then it's a natural progression to be less
afraid to try THC for people who might
[SPEAKER_08]: have had an issue with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's one of the ways you can
break down the stigma.
[SPEAKER_08]: We found out that we have this system,
that all living creatures have this
[SPEAKER_08]: system, and that these plants also provide
something that we need for that system to
[SPEAKER_08]: operate optimally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one last note.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, THCA, which is how the plant
produces it naturally when it's fresh off
[SPEAKER_04]: the bud, is non-psychoactive also,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not until you heat it or
decarboxylate it that the THCA turns into
[SPEAKER_04]: THC, and the A leaves and becomes
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a fresh plant, the whole thing could
be ingested or adjuced and be
[SPEAKER_04]: non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all very, very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it again for our princesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a wonderful panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to start mixing CBD in my
beer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
