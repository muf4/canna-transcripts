[SPEAKER_03]: You can talk to Jesse about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now our next panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be in English, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you need to go get a translator set,
you can get one out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: The founder.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're so happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're so lucky to have her here.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's an amazing person.
[SPEAKER_03]: The founder of MJ Universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it for Lisa Haag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, everybody, and welcome to our
speakers also and to our panel on evolving
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis policy within the European Union.
[SPEAKER_06]: So today ICBC is bringing to you Kai
Friedrich Niemann.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a business and corporate lawyer in
Germany since 2003.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's very familiar.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has a legal blog that is very worth
reading.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's also one of the major consultants
for CBD companies and medicinal companies
[SPEAKER_06]: in Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully very soon also for
recreational companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we have on this panel Carla Pareja.
[SPEAKER_06]: Carla is based in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's focused on cross-border corporate
transaction and regulatory matters,
[SPEAKER_06]: often in relation to Europe and also Latin
America.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been representing cannabis companies
for most of her legal career.
[SPEAKER_06]: She has graduated at University Pompufaba.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very famous university in Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she works in Spanish and Portuguese
and is originally here from Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we have Joe Rogoway.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's CEO and managing attorney at Rogoway
Law Group.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the founder and managing director
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're located in California and
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: As well as the Rogoway group at
Swissverein.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's professionally involved in the
cannabis industry since 2004.
[SPEAKER_06]: Has studied in Germany also.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's participated in numerous cases
related to cannabis for mediations and
[SPEAKER_06]: arbitrations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also have here Andrew Boer.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the president.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's active since 2019.
[SPEAKER_06]: And has worked tirelessly to represent the
voice of cannabis consumers in Malta.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's have a quick warm welcome to our
panelists.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then let's get started right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kai, let's start with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's the most pressing question is
happening at the moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is happening in Germany?
[SPEAKER_06]: So would you give us a latest update on
the legalization efforts in Germany?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do we stand right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is to be expected over the next
couple of months?
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as you all know, we had federal
elections in September 21 in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had a new government, the Traffic
Light Coalition, Social Democratic Party,
[SPEAKER_05]: the Liberal Party, and the Greens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they agreed in November 21 on
legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the plan is to distribute cannabis,
licensed cannabis, and licensed stores to
[SPEAKER_05]: adults.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since now, one and a half years ago,
nothing really much happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now the decisive month will be March
2023.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're expecting the draft of the
government in March, presented by the
[SPEAKER_05]: Ministry of Health.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably at the end of March, maybe there
will be a leak, like last time with this
[SPEAKER_05]: Keystone, with this Keypoint paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we will also see the plan of the
German government, how to roll out these
[SPEAKER_05]: drafts and how this can work.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have lots of international legal
issues, starting with the Single
[SPEAKER_05]: Convention to EU law.
[SPEAKER_05]: And mainly the last one and a half years,
we spent discussions on how to tackle
[SPEAKER_05]: this, how to handle this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the reason why it was so
slowly.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now we're expecting that we will see
two different kinds of drafts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first step of legalization will be
decriminalization, homegrown, and
[SPEAKER_05]: collective homegrown.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the plan is to get this draft at the
end of March to transfer it to Bundestag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it comes to Bundestag within the
normal procedures, first hearing,
[SPEAKER_05]: second hearing, third hearing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it will be agreed on before the
summer break of the Bundestag in June,
[SPEAKER_05]: July.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that happens, decriminalization and
homegrown will be allowed with immediate
[SPEAKER_05]: effect from June or July this year on.
[SPEAKER_05]: The complicated thing is the commercial
route, to establish a commercial route,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is the declared goal of the
government.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which means that you have a cultivation
license license, shops, and a real
[SPEAKER_05]: business, like we see in Canada and in the
US.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's tricky because there are lots
of legal issues going along with that,
[SPEAKER_05]: because imports, big question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, the German government assumes
that no imports are possible to Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: So every single gram has to be cultivated
in Germany, because the EU has the only
[SPEAKER_05]: authority to agree on international trade
agreements.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we can't find a way to deal with
that, we can't even have trade within the
[SPEAKER_05]: EU right now, because of this EU framework
decision.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're working behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So almost every, many EU member states,
like Czech Republic, Spain, Portugal,
[SPEAKER_05]: Malta, Luxembourg, Netherlands,
Germany, they all want to go a different
[SPEAKER_05]: route in terms of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're working behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's an initiative to change this
EU framework decision and to amend the
[SPEAKER_05]: Schengen Quay, so that at least the EU
member states can trade cannabis among
[SPEAKER_05]: them, if they want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they can legalize cannabis on a
certain legal basis, and not being afraid
[SPEAKER_05]: of the EU Commission to start infringement
procedures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that will also be explained by the
Health Ministry, how EU-conform,
[SPEAKER_05]: EU-compliant legalization can be rolled
out in Germany in March.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're expecting a federal Supreme
Court decision also in March, before the
[SPEAKER_05]: Easter break, on the general legality of
the cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the cannabis prohibition is legal and
complying with the constitution,
[SPEAKER_05]: on the grounds of the freedom of person,
Article 2 of our constitution,
[SPEAKER_05]: and Article 3, the principle of equality,
why is cannabis treated more strictly,
[SPEAKER_05]: more stricter than alcohol?
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are the big developments in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: March 2023 will be decisive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kai, maybe we stay with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just said that there's a lot of
contracts that have to be considered in
[SPEAKER_06]: that regard.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Germany, we're also talking about the
interpretation declaration or the
[SPEAKER_06]: interpretation solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you maybe tell the audience a little
bit about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is the 1961 Single Convention on
Narcotic Drugs saying that the trade of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis is only allowed for scientific
and medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is an international treaty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost every country in the world is a
member of this treaty.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have to deal somehow with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany is, in principle, very friendly to
international law.
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany wants to comply with these rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are different routes you can go,
like Uruguay takes a firm stance on human
[SPEAKER_05]: rights.
[SPEAKER_05]: Legalizing cannabis, allowing trade with
cannabis is on the grounds of human
[SPEAKER_05]: rights, because they had lots of crimes
and victims and people suffering.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the ban of prohibition, Canada did
sort of something else, something nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a mixture of human rights and
health protection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the German government is now saying,
we do an interpretation of this Single
[SPEAKER_05]: Convention.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we say to legalize is better health
protection than to go on to prohibit
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how we interpret it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is in line with the Single
Convention, because the Single Convention
[SPEAKER_05]: was made up for the health protection,
for the protection of the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's basically it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are so many legal problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything is disputed.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there is an intercede possible
retroactivity, et cetera, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can't find your way out with the
Single Convention.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can just take a firm stance on
human rights, like Uruguay, or on health
[SPEAKER_05]: protection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Single Convention will never be
changed in the near future.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of states like Russia or China
putting CBD in Hong Kong on the list of
[SPEAKER_05]: prohibited substances.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the more delicate issues, of course,
the EU, the framework decision to find a
[SPEAKER_05]: solution to allow international trade
within the EU to find ways that every EU
[SPEAKER_05]: member state can legalize on firm legal
grounds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's stay with the Single Convention
for a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: America has been one of the main driving
forces to bring this contractual framework
[SPEAKER_06]: into place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does the Single Convention play a role at
all in the US?
[SPEAKER_06]: And is the US maybe also in a second step
considering to legalize cannabis also on a
[SPEAKER_06]: national level?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it going to stay federal?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going to stay on a state level?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say probably no to both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that the US is really
concerned about the Single Convention's
[SPEAKER_00]: treaty in terms of domestic policy or with
respect to violating international law if
[SPEAKER_00]: domestic laws were to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not, I don't think, a part of
the considerations or the conversation or
[SPEAKER_00]: the political dialogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet it is ironic, obviously, that the US
essentially imposed this on the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world and is ambivalent about the
impact of that obligation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of federal legalization,
there is kind of perennial conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm a little cynical at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't think that it's likely to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Biden had his chance when he
had control over both houses, or the
[SPEAKER_00]: Democrats rather had control over both
houses of Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that the House of Representatives
is in control of the Republican Party,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's very unlikely that
they'll be in favor of the legislation
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes it through Congress to legalize
cannabis in the near term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's going to have to be,
in terms of just the sequencing,
[SPEAKER_00]: another election where there's the party
in power for Congress and the president
[SPEAKER_00]: that supports legalization, which at this
point, and historically, the Republicans
[SPEAKER_00]: are just not in favor of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think probably what the future is
going to look like for the US is much of
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's looked so far, which is sort of
this piecemeal approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different states essentially being the
laboratory of ideas and trying to enact
[SPEAKER_00]: their own policies that have some
commonalities but are fairly disjointed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really problematic actually,
because kind of similar to how it is at
[SPEAKER_00]: least described with, how Kai described
with the EU is there's no real common
[SPEAKER_00]: denominator for policy in the US other
than prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, the US policy federally is
that cannabis is the same as heroin,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas when we're talking about
California, where I am, medical use has
[SPEAKER_00]: been legal since 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization was enacted by the voters in
2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can go to a lot of different
parts of the state, access cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: legally, obviously not treated like
heroin, but the federal government still
[SPEAKER_00]: has it as a schedule and controlled
substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's somewhat of a schizophrenic
approach, I think both with respect to
[SPEAKER_00]: international law and domestically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Andrew, let's go over to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the status on cannabis legalization
in Malta?
[SPEAKER_06]: And say if I were on holiday there,
could I just go and visit a social club
[SPEAKER_06]: and get some cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's early days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, Malta is on the tip of
everyone's tongue at the moment because it
[SPEAKER_04]: has the most progressive law in Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you actually look at what the law
is saying, you'll find out that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: nowhere near legalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is closer to some sort of
decriminalization, which may be a partial
[SPEAKER_04]: decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we have in the law is we can grow up
to four plants without being criminalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can have seven grams of cannabis
possession out in public.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can expand your criminal records.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, there is the biggest part of the
law, which would be the issuing of
[SPEAKER_04]: licenses to open what were meant to be
social clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, along the line,
there's a lot of politics involved and
[SPEAKER_04]: prime ministers fall and you get a new
one, ministers change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the topic goes from one ministry to
another and gets lost in translation with
[SPEAKER_04]: no handover.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this is in all politics,
but unfortunately, it's what happened in
[SPEAKER_04]: Malta.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't really have a model which is
going to be either social and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be no clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they've decided to call them
associations, which is going to be based
[SPEAKER_04]: more on a dispensary system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to be obviously a member of
this club where you can go and acquire
[SPEAKER_04]: your cannabis and take it home.
[SPEAKER_04]: But licenses have just been issued now,
like literally last week.
[SPEAKER_04]: So applications basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, those people that apply don't
even know what the final license fee is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of being rolled out and being
formed as they go along.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to say that my organization is
involved, obviously, as much as possible
[SPEAKER_04]: to try and shape policy to make sure that
it's a just an effective policy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's in general very important to
be involved in the discussion so that
[SPEAKER_06]: rules are made with you and not for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Carla, let's move over to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some homegrown and social clubs,
do they play or did they play a role
[SPEAKER_06]: during the legalization efforts in US
states?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what would you recommend to lawmakers
and to debate in Europe on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis social clubs actually have
existed in the United States for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 1920s, they were called teapots,
and they were bars where people went and
[SPEAKER_02]: listened to jazz music and smoked
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they disappeared after cannabis became
illegal, but they have played a role,
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see that there is a path toward
legalization and where cannabis social
[SPEAKER_02]: clubs and homegrown cannabis is generally
part of this regularization.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 1973, that's how we started in the
United States with Oregon, followed by
[SPEAKER_02]: California and Alaska and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one very important thing to keep in
mind after so many years of bad propaganda
[SPEAKER_02]: in cannabis is responsible use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these cannabis social clubs promote
this responsible use where people have a
[SPEAKER_02]: place to go and consume cannabis in a
social setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the states in the United States that
have legalized cannabis but have not
[SPEAKER_02]: regulated the social clubs are somehow
handicapped because you can purchase
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis but you don't have a place to go
and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we've seen, for example,
in states like California, where the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis social clubs have been regulated,
is that you can go and the dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: licenses allow you to also consume
cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are different approaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, in New York, it's more of a
separate the same way as alcohol works,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of, where you can go purchase
cannabis, like a liquor store.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot consume it there, but you can
purchase it and consume it at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you have the retail license where you
can go and purchase cannabis, but you
[SPEAKER_02]: cannot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the retail license would be like the
liquor store and then you have the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption license where you can go and
consume it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And New York is actually issuing the first
licenses this summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: New Jersey also has included just passed
some regulations on cannabis social clubs
[SPEAKER_02]: and homegrown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for the European lawmakers,
we should keep in mind that legalization
[SPEAKER_02]: should have in mind that the safety and
quality of the products, it should
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely include what I was mentioning
about responsible use, and it should
[SPEAKER_02]: recognize the benefits of cannabis such as
reducing the burden on law enforcement and
[SPEAKER_02]: reducing the criminal activities.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kai, decriminalization and collective
homegrown or cannabis social clubs as a
[SPEAKER_06]: possible Plan B has been discussed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this compatible with EU law and
Schengen-Ekwe framework decision?
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned before, everything is
disputed, but this is in the most
[SPEAKER_05]: justifiable way.
[SPEAKER_05]: The decriminalization, yes, this is
Article 3 of the framework decision is
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about personal consumption,
but think about cannabis social clubs in
[SPEAKER_05]: Hamburg, Frankfurt, Hannover, Berlin,
5,000 members.
[SPEAKER_05]: Imagine what a growth this would be.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plan is that you can legally grow
three plants, three flowering plants at
[SPEAKER_05]: one time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have the plants in the early
stages, and as soon as they turn into
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering, you have to get rid of one or
you have to have a better management of
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you delegate this rate right to a
cannabis social club, so you have 1,000
[SPEAKER_05]: members, then you can have 3,000 flowering
plants at one time.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that is compatible, with EU law,
with these provisions in Article 3 of the
[SPEAKER_05]: framework decision, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anytime we talk about cannabis legally
and globally, you will never get a clear
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation without any justified arguments
and some circumvention rules in
[SPEAKER_05]: argumentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is like it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Social Democratic Party is very
much in favor of the cannabis social club
[SPEAKER_05]: because they think you can exercise a
social control within the association,
[SPEAKER_05]: with the members.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to really promote that and give
a clear legal framework for that so that
[SPEAKER_05]: you can really have huge numbers,
huge associations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is a good way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for a first start for Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's possible to realize that really
after the decision in Bundestag.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm really looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe also to mention the
associations are an important thing in
[SPEAKER_06]: Germany anyways.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have like associations for ducks,
hound breeders, bowling clubs,
[SPEAKER_06]: and whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a lot of associations also for
patients, for example.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's an important role in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I look in the scene here in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many social clubs?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hundreds?
[SPEAKER_05]: Over a hundred?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have a cultural event program.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have bands.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have DJing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can come together, share your
experience, share your grow experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's perfect for a start.
[SPEAKER_06]: Carla, let's go back to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So social clubs in Spain, what's your
opinion on that and how well do you think
[SPEAKER_06]: are those regulated?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so cannabis social clubs in Spain
operate under a legal limbo.
[SPEAKER_02]: The International Single Convention on
Narcotic Drugs was ratified by Spain in
[SPEAKER_02]: 1966.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it prohibits the production,
the public possession, the trafficking,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the stipulation on public possession is
where everything comes around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the private possession consumption in
Spain is basically decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the cannabis social clubs here work a
little bit like the Netherlands social
[SPEAKER_02]: clubs, with the difference that they are
not open to the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a member only club.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be a member.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a member invite only type of club.
[SPEAKER_02]: So generally, you can only join the clubs
if you're invited by another example.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an existing member.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an area where people go and pay a
membership fee.
[SPEAKER_02]: The membership fee doesn't go towards the
purchase of cannabis because the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: clubs are nonprofit organizations,
so they can't have a commercial purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the membership fee that you pay is
basically towards the grow of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and the maintenance of the social club
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other places, most of the clubs are
here in Catalonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are quite a number of clubs also in
the Pais Vasco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here in Catalonia, they are somehow
regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are certain factors that need to
be followed from a perspective of public
[SPEAKER_02]: health and the amount of cannabis that can
be sold to an individual within a period
[SPEAKER_02]: of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other places where the social clubs
are not regulated under local law,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are concerns over potential criminal
activities that take place.
For example, in the Pais Vasco,
there are concerns over the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in the social clubs because of
the potential high revenues that they can
[SPEAKER_02]: generate and the low chance of being
prosecuted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, Spain should definitely take
steps towards regulating the social clubs
[SPEAKER_02]: in a more complete way because currently
they're just operating under a gray area.
So it's just a matter of time before we
can have a very clear decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that I think is
important.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing that I think is also
important is that the role of the social
[SPEAKER_06]: clubs in the Pais Vasco, in the Pais
Vasco, is also very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think probably the role of the
social clubs in the Pais Vasco is
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the human rights obligation
is being used a lot together with health
[SPEAKER_04]: and social justice, which is where the
Cannabis Social Club model fits in
[SPEAKER_04]: perfectly, because it's a decriminalized
system, and you are basically flying under
[SPEAKER_04]: the radar of the single convention.
[SPEAKER_04]: So no rules are really being broken,
and it's an easy way to go forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can understand that Malta
obviously isn't going to go for complete
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization, like maybe Germany has more
muscle to be able to do that and
[SPEAKER_04]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can understand that Malta,
being a smaller country, has decided,
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously wanted to reform with the new
government that came in 2013.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a strong urge to actually make
this reform.
[SPEAKER_04]: But obviously, when you look at the rules
and regulations, you realize what you
[SPEAKER_04]: really can and where the big challenges
are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the big challenges we know is
basically that commercial sale,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is prohibited.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you have a social club model which
is built by the community for the
[SPEAKER_04]: community, offering a safe space,
and obviously also a perfect space to
[SPEAKER_04]: introduce harm reduction measures,
this obviously fits in with the human
[SPEAKER_04]: rights obligation as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is pretty much acceptable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's the route we're taking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it comes to speaking with the EU,
it's important to keep dialogue open,
[SPEAKER_04]: explain to them exactly what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an agency, which is called the
Authority for the Responsible Use of
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis, which has been set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's in the process of employing more
people and getting the framework together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the European Commission knows exactly
what is going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is open dialogue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so far, we haven't had any problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it a plan B for Germany?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think so, because at the end of
the day, it's a safe route.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one which I know the grassroots
movement and actual consumers would be
[SPEAKER_04]: happy with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then obviously, commercialization is
something that you can't avoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that's going to come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we truly believe, especially my
organization believes, that we should be
[SPEAKER_04]: building from the bottom up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once we do that, then industry can
come in and play together with the
[SPEAKER_04]: community.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way, you leave no cracks in the
foundation of building a new framework.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the social clubs are step one in the
commercialization, potentially a second
[SPEAKER_06]: step?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, commercialization is inevitable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that has to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's important that one
country doesn't go it alone when trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: challenge this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that if the like-minded countries
can get together and have a solid
[SPEAKER_04]: proposal, I think it will make much more
sense and be easier to move forward that
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joel, you've been doing this for a very
long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what would you recommend to EU member
states who want to legalize or regulate
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, adult use cannabis, in regard to
the experience you made in the US?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've made a lot of mistakes in the US,
particularly in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that the
over-commercialization is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw after legalization just this
hyperactive capitalization of companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that were not mature enough to take on the
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The businesses didn't really have a model
to be able to responsibly use that
[SPEAKER_00]: investment money.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a lot of examples of
companies getting $50 million,
[SPEAKER_00]: $100 million, and squandering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people in California
in particular would feel that the model
[SPEAKER_00]: that existed under the medical laws from
about 2004 until 2017 when legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: was implemented is superior to the
legalization model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the model that we had basically
these collectives and cooperatives that
[SPEAKER_00]: qualified patients at that time could
collectively associate to cultivate
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis and provide that to the
qualified patient members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same as what Kai was describing with
Germany, we could aggregate the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants per patient and get to a larger
number of plants to be produced and then
[SPEAKER_00]: provided to those patients and also
through a nonprofit model.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all of the flaws that that model had,
it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was successful for a long period of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And legacy cannabis industry operators
were able to be successful for 10 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years under that model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when legalization happened
because so much money went into it and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was so much hype and the regulations
were just unsettled.
[SPEAKER_00]: The laws were unsettled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal law, as we just discussed,
is not helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that stuff sort of conspired
together to make legalization really
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging to implement in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just sort of one state out of
50 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you look at most parts of
America, almost nowhere can you have
[SPEAKER_00]: on-site social consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost entirely what the model is is like
off-sale retail where you can go and
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase it and then consume it
essentially only in your home and usually
[SPEAKER_00]: only if you own your home because a lot of
rental leases have conditions like
[SPEAKER_00]: non-smoking rules as a part of that lease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you have a situation where
people can consume cannabis at their home
[SPEAKER_00]: or in public, which is generally
prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people consume in their cars,
which is obviously not a good idea and
[SPEAKER_00]: also prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think actually the Germany Plan B
maybe should be Plan A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the legalization of having a model of
more of a sort of pharmaceutical based
[SPEAKER_00]: model, a monopoly type model is I don't
think going to be as beneficial as
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is more grassroots,
more bottom up, more focused on the people
[SPEAKER_00]: and the organizations that have been a
part of legalization from the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: and to rely on them and their expertise,
their knowledge to carry forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Step in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see the problem when you have these two
routes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have the social club model and the
commercial route.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to protect the commercial route
and you have to make sure that these
[SPEAKER_05]: social club ideas are really restrained to
a community, to a social club,
[SPEAKER_05]: to the members and the members taking it
seriously.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it can't be that social clubs are in
fact commercial businesses just taking the
[SPEAKER_05]: easier rules for operating because the
commercial route will have to be licensed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will have to be invested in retail
stores and retail structures and you have
[SPEAKER_05]: to really, really separate that and you
have to control that as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the cannabis social club must be a
social model and not a hidden business
[SPEAKER_05]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, one quick response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two things can exist in parallel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not mutually exclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the social club model is a
good backstop against the sort of full
[SPEAKER_00]: fledged capitalistic approach that I think
has really been problematic for Los
[SPEAKER_00]: Angeles, which is in particular,
which is maybe the largest cannabis market
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world has utterly failed to
implement legalization on every level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a huge disappointment for the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge disappointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for me personally, and I think,
you know, different countries within the
[SPEAKER_00]: EU can do a much better job than we've
done domestically in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they learn from our lessons and they
kind of move the policy forward in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think it really should be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe one last final question before we
move on to the audience for all of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe one quick sentence statement.
[SPEAKER_06]: What should the vision look like for the
EU and global cannabis legalization?
[SPEAKER_05]: A robust system which makes global trade
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say create a system that is on parity
with how alcohol is regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a model in your country
where you can freely buy it and consume
[SPEAKER_00]: it, whatever those age limits are,
just adopt that same model to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can work with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to create an entirely
new and weird and separate model just for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't need to be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I think that if that
was implemented in the US, we would have a
[SPEAKER_00]: far better cannabis system of regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it should be seen from a
perspective of safety, public health,
[SPEAKER_02]: social equity, and research and
innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a public health perspective,
what I mentioned about responsible use is
[SPEAKER_02]: very important to promote responsible use.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a safety perspective, I think there
should be robust testing requirements to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure the products that we bring to
the market are safe and of high quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: The communities of color and low income
communities have been negatively impacted
[SPEAKER_02]: and disproportionately impacted by
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that this community should have
access to the benefits of a legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there should be constant research and
innovation to make sure we have quality
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis based products in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there should definitely be an
international perspective on the
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the EU needs to take a good hard
look at the criminalization that is still
[SPEAKER_04]: happening in different countries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the statistics and see how many
people's lives are getting ruined at the
[SPEAKER_04]: moment for simple possession, cultivation,
or consumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: And realize that prohibition is doing
obviously more damage than the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once they take a good hard look at the
figures and the statistics, then they can
[SPEAKER_04]: realize that obviously we have to move to
some sort of reform with decriminalization
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel being the first step.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Germany, we have over 200,000 criminal
cases prosecuted for personal consumption.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you to the panelists.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's open the floor for questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just have six minutes left,
so I can only take one or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for a very informative
and engaging panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Carla just started to touch on
this at the end of the subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the interesting contrasts
between the US and Europe is that the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption lounges came as sort of a
secondary proposal to the commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas here, it seems like that the
consumption lounges are more the foot in
[SPEAKER_01]: the door to commercial legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that I see is that,
well, I mean, I guess the opportunity that
[SPEAKER_01]: with the consumption lounges coming later
is licensing around consumption lounges,
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing around deliveries, and the
relatively low barriers to entry
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with those made them very
attractive licenses for social equity
[SPEAKER_01]: applicants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't see as acute a problem in
Europe around social equity and the impact
[SPEAKER_01]: of the war on drugs to disproportionately
impacted communities, but it is an issue
[SPEAKER_01]: in Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if these consumption lounges are sort
of the foot in the door for the larger
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial interests, how do you see the
evolution of cannabis policy within Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: in embracing the legacy market and those
communities that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: disproportionately impacted by
prohibition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it's important to do
something similar to what was done in the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the social equity licenses
were, the intention was a very good
[SPEAKER_02]: intention.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem that has happened is that a
lot of investors have basically taken over
[SPEAKER_02]: these licenses and the social equity
applicants have been put in a second
[SPEAKER_02]: stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the intention was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important to give special
license to these applicants, but it should
[SPEAKER_02]: be done in a way to protect the interests
because it hasn't been done the way it was
[SPEAKER_02]: intended in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Joe, you have a different
opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree completely that we need to take
care of the communities that have been the
[SPEAKER_00]: most harmed from the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, it's a very
problematic and troubled history with
[SPEAKER_00]: respect to communities of color in
particular and how those communities have
[SPEAKER_00]: been impacted by prohibition and
disproportionate incarcerate and all those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with how we've dealt with
social equity is that we really haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: inured the benefits of legalization to
those communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we've done with our programs is given
basically a better spot in line to the
[SPEAKER_00]: permits that are issued out of municipal
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is, to Carla's point,
there is companies that are forced,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in the LA social equity program,
they're forced to have a social equity
[SPEAKER_00]: component to their application in order to
be able to get a local permit,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is prerequisite to a state license
and that's how one becomes legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those relationships are very
exploitative and what ends up happening is
[SPEAKER_00]: the social equity applicant ends up not
being benefited from that relationship,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just used from that relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I think should happen is looking
at more of a community benefit model where
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of just giving preferential
treatment to someone's ability to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: permit first, that ultimately doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What matters is that the communities that
are underprivileged, that are underserved,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are just inadequately represented in
basically all ways, they get access to
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits that come from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they don't consume cannabis,
writ large to individuals in those
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, where we have tax dollars,
for example, derived from cannabis to fund
[SPEAKER_00]: social programs for communities that need
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the solution, I think, not just
getting preferential treatment in line and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a big, big reason why a lot of the
bigger metropolitan areas in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and in California in particular have
really failed with their local permitting
[SPEAKER_00]: is they're focused on this really just
inadequate model of trying to help social
[SPEAKER_00]: equity communities and programs in a way
that doesn't actually help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits need to be driven to
communities, not preferential treatment in
[SPEAKER_00]: one permit application for one applicant
who ends up getting exploited by the
[SPEAKER_00]: investors oftentimes in that company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for saying that, it's very
important and I think it's a good last
[SPEAKER_06]: word.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have any questions to the
panelists, you can find them outside later
[SPEAKER_06]: and address that directly and then we're
done here and thank you everybody for
[SPEAKER_06]: listening to our panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very informative, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a lot of heavy hitters, you guys are
all so amazing, we appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, it's the kind of talent we get
here at the International Cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: Business Conference.
Thank you.
