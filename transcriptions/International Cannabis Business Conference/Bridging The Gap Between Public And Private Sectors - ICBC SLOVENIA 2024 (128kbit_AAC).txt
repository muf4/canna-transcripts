[SPEAKER_03]: Bridging the gap between public and
private sectors, here to lead us to
[SPEAKER_03]: moderate this panel, the founder,
the CEO, the executive producer of all the
[SPEAKER_03]: ICBC event series.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please welcome Alex Rogers!
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, how's everyone feeling?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone feeling good, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Get some good lunch, got some energy,
model doucha, here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'd like to thank, can we put our
hands together one more time for Mr.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holmberg for being the oracle of knowledge
that he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Peter, we appreciate you man.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our next panel is on private-public
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is an interesting topic in terms
of public and private partnerships.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few nuance, different things
that go on with traditionally cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: companies, private companies with public
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the analogy is intact and we have
a panel of esteemed experts today that are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to talk about public and private
partnerships in general in Slovenia and
[SPEAKER_04]: then we can find corollaries with in that
of how that can be analogous to the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to introduce my colleagues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Firstly, at the end here is Bostjan Ferk,
Dr. Ferk, he's the founder and the
[SPEAKER_04]: director of the Institute for
Public-Private Partnerships Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bostjan C, is that how you spell it?
[SPEAKER_04]: C, okay, cool, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Co-founder of Lubina, a lot of people know
the Lubina company, very important company
[SPEAKER_04]: here in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's also the co-founder of Biotech Hills
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure if this man needs an
introduction who's sitting next to me,
[SPEAKER_04]: but Dr. Droskova Selinovich and he's the
president of the Board of Slovenian
[SPEAKER_04]: Business and Research Association in
Brussels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please give some applause for our esteemed
guest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you guys for being here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know this view sucks, but you just have
to endure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll just have to endure together here in
Lake Bled.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Drosko, I'd like to start with you
and ask, when we talk public-private
[SPEAKER_04]: partnerships, what are the most important
types of relationships that can happen
[SPEAKER_04]: with regards to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well hello from my side as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice public here, a lot of interesting
discussion going on, especially from a
[SPEAKER_02]: legal perspective regarding my,
let's say, interest here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, talking about PPP, it's very,
I would say, broad subject really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's idea that we go into
details what kind of possibilities are
[SPEAKER_02]: here possible, but for me, what I know now
about this industry that you are
[SPEAKER_02]: presenting here, I think it would be so
important to improve and enlarge research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I understand a lot of things
haven't been properly researched yet
[SPEAKER_02]: regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is the most important issue
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever cooperation even, I would go
broader than just PPP, because PPP could
[SPEAKER_02]: be quite specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have different forums, different
legal, I would say contracts, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe colleagues can go more deeper into
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, it would be really important
to improve cooperation between research
[SPEAKER_02]: institutes, which let's say in countries
like Slovenia, are mostly public.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be public part of this
cooperation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you guys that you do
business regarding cannabis would benefit
[SPEAKER_02]: from this research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you would cooperate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be kind of cooperation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So win-win situation, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through that, maybe I can go later on
into that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through that, I even claim maybe at this
point theoretically, you could get some EU
[SPEAKER_02]: funding for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there aren't any, I would say,
tender calls in Brussels regarding
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis as such.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there are calls regarding
medicine, health, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever innovation you bring into
that, you can get funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you wouldn't be able to go for a
certain area because there isn't area
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis there within those calls.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are, as I said, innovative
health projects and deepening resources
[SPEAKER_02]: for research in this area could be
potentially also legit for certain EU
[SPEAKER_02]: funding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And is that also the case not just for
biomedicine, but for hemp also?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say for eco-solutions, like making a
more environmentally friendly building
[SPEAKER_04]: material, for example?
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant, first of all, medical part.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, mentioning this,
if somebody, I don't know, we had this
[SPEAKER_02]: batteries issue, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was introduced in Ljubljana in the
parliament even.
[SPEAKER_02]: So using, let's say, cannabis in
batteries, then maybe when you talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: green economy, there are possibilities
there, agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think all this should be more
introduced in Brussels as well in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: get certain more, I would say,
precise reaction from the Commission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because right now, by the way,
preparing our event on the 15th of May
[SPEAKER_02]: next year in Brussels with the idea to put
that on map in Brussels more.
[SPEAKER_02]: How should I say more precisely?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really to put broad picture what all
cannabis can be used for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, medical part is probably
the most important, but not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to put all this on the
table.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just the last thing, I just apologize,
maybe just that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So preparing this event for the next year,
15th of May in Brussels, I also learned
[SPEAKER_02]: that, let's say, whatever you ask
Commission about cannabis right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: they are very, very cautious about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nobody wants to say anything really
direct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe with the new Commission coming
up, there's a chance, and I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: good timing next year, May, to get more
from them.
Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, Groszko and I, are planning a
disruptive event in Brussels on May 15th
[SPEAKER_04]: on private-public partnerships.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're basically, it's a lobby effort
of sorts for the Commission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulation policies, that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting, Groszko.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need lawyers.
[SPEAKER_02]: These good lawyers that you have here,
we'll need them in Brussels next year for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter's so there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're so there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you know it or not, Peter,
you're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boston, I should say, goes both fair,
because we have two Boschians on the
[SPEAKER_04]: panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: That segues into one of the various ways
in which the public and private sectors
[SPEAKER_04]: collaborate in the field of research and
development.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you expound on that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that PPPs is only one way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We shouldn't forget the traditional way,
that it's subsidies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the EU funds came to the
subsidies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture, research, health,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So subsidies is the first pillar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe combination of subsidies,
private funds could make PPPs work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next pillar or next layer, I think it's
very important also that you focus a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit on public procurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because public procurement is,
public authorities are huge buyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can sell them goods,
services, this is huge market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will make the confidence on the
market for other buyers higher and easier
[SPEAKER_01]: to purchase the goods.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same goods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think came the PPP,
which is the most complex part of
[SPEAKER_01]: collaboration because of two reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: First reason is that you always have to
some sort establish public interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's public interest in PPP?
[SPEAKER_01]: Health issues, agriculture, some research,
education, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is always a political question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Public interest is always a political
question because I know in Slovenia that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes, I know, government degree or city
council decision or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's political question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other part is the transfer of risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have PPP contract, we have to deal
about identification of risk, allocation
[SPEAKER_01]: of risk, and who will take this risk
through the different projects.
And then the second reason is that you
have to have a public opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So public opinion is the biggest obstacle
when you are preparing the PPP project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are two main questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the biggest obstacle when you are
preparing the PPP project is always,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only on this specific topic that you
are talking about in this conference,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also in public infrastructure or
public services, is the public opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Public opinion is against PPPs because
that means privatization, that means
[SPEAKER_01]: profits for private, and so like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is not the real idea of PPPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of PPPs is to combine resources,
knowledge, funds, and everything to get
[SPEAKER_01]: something added value, to get added value.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you think that Slovenia is changing
a little bit their attitude and
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding the importance of the
private sector and entrepreneurship?
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that on the government level,
we didn't change a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are still mostly in the public
institutes and public funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subsidies are the main way of financing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the municipality, on local level,
we can see some areas that are more
[SPEAKER_01]: innovative.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are more open to new projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we as consultants did,
we changed the name of the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not speaking about PPP anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are speaking about energy contracting
or some other name that basically is
[SPEAKER_01]: legally PPP.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it sounds much better.
[SPEAKER_04]: So are there some optionists in Slovenia
then that are more open to this type of
[SPEAKER_04]: cooperation and more nimble and adaptive?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ljubljana is one of the examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kranj here nearby is also.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some municipalities that are
quite open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they see that PPPs could be one
alternative to the traditional way to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop quicker and easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even some very small ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even small ones, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small cities are also practicing that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I may say a short joke,
how Slovenian understand PPP?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the narrative is, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where I'm from in America, we actually
look at it kind of as the opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the government that's on the
take and the privateers, they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: succeed unless everybody succeeds around
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the private part would not go into PPP
if he or she doesn't see potential profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or quite sure profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's take it back really quick to your
first prong.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said it was subsidies, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now would you be also of the opinion that
a PPP is a more sustainable model once you
[SPEAKER_04]: get it going than subsidies per se?
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give you the example of energy
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of projects in Slovenia of
refurbishing the old public buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we combined EU funds, but it's
subsidy, and private funds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do it really quickly and efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of projects all around Slovenia on
the municipality level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But interesting, on the government level,
I don't remember one project that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: successfully presented.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping you wouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: May I jump in with one sentence?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why the European Union is
projecting for the next budget,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is starting in 2028, but it's
planned already now, more, let's say,
[SPEAKER_02]: private part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these subsidies will go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If now, let's say, certain projects are
financed 70% from EU funding, in future
[SPEAKER_02]: there will be maybe 60% in order that
private part would give more into the
[SPEAKER_02]: project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through that you can somehow get more,
let's say, guaranteed that project will be
[SPEAKER_02]: successful and that the private part will
put everything in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just money, but also all other
resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes too much sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bosjan, so you're the privateer here with
the business.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it look like on the business
side of things?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you've started a very big project
called Biotech Hills, which has to do with
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you expound on that a bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously great to see lots of faces
and some familiar faces as well in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe just a little bit of intro of
what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from Labena.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labena is a family company, well
established, not just in Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_00]: but internationally here in the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: We operate internationally or globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our main focus is research and
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Services for pharmaceutical and biotech
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have also laboratories here in Slovenia
where we are based.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the biggest part of operations
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe what we started in Labena years
ago, and that was in 2007 before I joined,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I myself spent a lot of time abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually working in big pharmaceutical
companies, GSK, Novo Nordisk, Otsuka
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharma, which is a Japanese company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And worked actually already a lot abroad
on private-public initiatives or
[SPEAKER_00]: partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: We in Labena started doing that in 2007 as
part of research collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially we became a research
institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hence we also operate not just for
profit, but we operate to generate science
[SPEAKER_00]: and science that can be potentially
translated to commercial opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now to tie into, so we have quite a
bit of experience working with the public
[SPEAKER_00]: sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working with the public sector,
not just on projects, but significant
[SPEAKER_00]: initiatives I think is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is it key?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, and I'm gonna say this a
little bit against obviously someone who's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from a private sector, working with
the public sector keeps the private
[SPEAKER_00]: interests a little bit in check.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of that, if you collaborate with
the public sector, you have to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: look from a broader perspective of
interest as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It forces you to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gives you the leverage of actually
obviously higher impact and influence
[SPEAKER_00]: which you cannot achieve as a smaller or
limited private business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that this is, if you wanna
build an ecosystem, which I think in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world of cannabis would be extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talk about ecosystems,
I mean all players combined within a
[SPEAKER_00]: territory that can be a country,
it can be a region, it can be even Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: working together to achieve something,
it is inevitable that you have to work in
[SPEAKER_00]: a private public partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is kind of what we learned from
experience in Labena.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we got together with some of
the other partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tie into cannabis industry here
as well to form just a few months ago the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea about forming an institute or a
platform to make sure that we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: together policymakers, so get behind the
same table, policymakers, academia,
[SPEAKER_00]: institutes, and obviously private entities
to be able to effect a change in this
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the initiative of Slovenia
Biotech Kills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Slovenia Biotech Kills, it's Zavod.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would translate institutes basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually, we signed a
memorandum of understanding with the
[SPEAKER_00]: government of Slovenia, with the minister
of Slovenia actually right in this room
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just right there in that corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereby we agreed on certain metrics to
make sure that we together elevate the
[SPEAKER_00]: prosperity and added value of economy
based on development of one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important sectors in Slovenia with
probably the longest tradition and added
[SPEAKER_00]: value currently which is the biotech
sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis inevitably falls within the
biotech because there is, when you
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture a product whereby cannabis as
a plant is a base, you go through a
[SPEAKER_00]: biotechnological process inevitably or
where you're developing products from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it very much sits in this domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why we think the public private
partnership is important, it's not only to
[SPEAKER_00]: secure funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the first question we got was,
do you want more money from the
[SPEAKER_00]: government?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that why you did it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer was, well eventually yes,
but not directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to be subsidized.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want to do is develop conditions,
policies, tax policies, policies to
[SPEAKER_00]: attract skilled labor force into Slovenia,
policies to introduce levies for
[SPEAKER_00]: innovative startups which can be startups
in cannabis or biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they will set their footprint in
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to put Slovenia on the map,
on the global map when somebody thinks
[SPEAKER_00]: biotechnology, Slovenia is on the list of
countries where you would want to put your
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing plant or R&D capabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the ambition and cannabis pertains
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of see PPPs in a much
broader sense beyond just the project but
[SPEAKER_00]: actually initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will drive increased added value for
citizens living in a certain geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be Slovenia or it can be a wider
geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will just say, I mean because you
asked me about initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the initiative itself, it's called
Slovenia Biotech Hills.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really the vision is that we kind of
create an environment in connections and
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborations and networks through
central Eastern Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that central Eastern Europe becomes a
more recognizable hub through Slovenia as
[SPEAKER_00]: well for biotech innovation including
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I love to hear that it's a very
entrepreneurial attitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very, what I would consider real
progressivism talking about how will we
[SPEAKER_04]: incentivize people to come to Slovenia?
[SPEAKER_04]: How will we partner with the government,
with the policy makers, with all the
[SPEAKER_04]: players to have things like incentives?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I love the idea of incentivizing but
not subsidizing because that means it's
[SPEAKER_04]: actually sustainable, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is crucial.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is hard when you come from the
European social state mentality.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to break that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's like I remember years ago and
I'll just say something quick before I go
[SPEAKER_04]: to the next question.
[SPEAKER_04]: But years ago I was listening to National
Public Radio and they were talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: non-profits and how the model of
non-profits had changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Previously, if your non-profit raised
$300,000, 80% of that money goes,
[SPEAKER_04]: immediately has to go to, or at least 80%,
maybe 90, has to go to do shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can't reinvest money that you get
donated for a non-profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now, and this one particular show was
talking about how this guy would come to
[SPEAKER_04]: non-profits and he'd say, well let's take
$20,000 and throw an event and a
[SPEAKER_04]: fundraiser and see if we can't,
with some of that money that was donated,
[SPEAKER_04]: create more money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a business would do, not a non-profit
who is just depending on subsidies or
[SPEAKER_04]: donations, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I always think of that, listening to
that maybe 20 years ago, as a big change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I related to that because I think
if you're a practical, logical person and
[SPEAKER_04]: a human who wants to evolve and develop,
you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to be proud of what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that's one of the most
interesting things that we could mention
[SPEAKER_04]: now is almost that shift in mentality of,
hey, we got to be more responsible,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there's more, maybe there's some risk
too, but the reward is there and the
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainability is there as you build brick
by brick, not just get a brick,
[SPEAKER_04]: then take the brick away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then a new brick, then take the brick
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boston, Mr. Ferrick, are you aware of any
notable examples of public-private
[SPEAKER_04]: partnerships in the areas of innovation,
research and development in Slovenia
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically that you could talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, we have one very interesting
micro PPP here nearby from Crane,
[SPEAKER_01]: city of the Crane.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the privately founded institute
that research human fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a cave animal living only in the
cross region.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a brand of a beer now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are focusing on the environmental
influence of these species, very rare
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for 60 years, they have problems with
funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was always struggling for public
funds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a big challenge how to make
some self-driven model, self-sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: model to make their work visible,
public, and to make it also a business
[SPEAKER_01]: model that will cover costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they make the cooperation with the
municipality of Crane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is a cave animal,
we use old Second World War tunnel,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is under the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the input from the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guys from the institute,
they present the exhibition, life animals
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we prepare the new tourist attraction
that creates money, invites people buying
[SPEAKER_01]: tickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: With these tickets, we will finance the
cost of the new attraction, but also the
[SPEAKER_01]: profit will go for research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do it on the micro level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it also in the higher scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even easier because business cases
are better.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Drasko, do you have something to add
to that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, PPP is, let's say, more complex to
achieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it gives, of course, more security for
both sides, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also understood you wanted to show
that before with your cases, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just money to get the money,
but really to get all other, I would say,
[SPEAKER_02]: components that are important for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have one big advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is long-term partnership.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not only for one year or two years,
but it could be for 15, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are planning to do some
innovation, some research, then you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to run for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are examples in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many examples internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we talk about Slovenia first,
there's an example of automobilski grosta,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for mobility and for cluster of
automobile manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grosta is cluster?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grosta is like a grape or cluster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an example which has been around
for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, Slovenia is one of the
major exporters of automobile parts to
[SPEAKER_00]: major automobile manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Akrapovic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Akrapovic is one of the manufacturers
there, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: That represents 20% of Slovenian GDP,
automobile stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Automobile stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: 20%?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's over $10 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are very sophisticated
examples that I wanted to expand on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, much more intertwined.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call them not just partnerships,
but really ecosystems, such as the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: Boston area on biotech and the MIT
connected directly to companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as obviously the federal
government involved in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that in itself is an example that
a lot of countries in Europe followed and
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented to become certain hubs or
centers for development or research in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are not funding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call them projects of ecosystems
or ecosystems of public-private
[SPEAKER_00]: partnerships.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's the ecosystem that creates the
sustainability, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the sustainability that is the
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's connected, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the point is the ecosystem
comprises of different contributors that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be public or private, but actually
aligned around the common interest to
[SPEAKER_00]: usually invest their time and resources in
a certain location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ecosystem is usually bound to a
certain location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that this is how I see
private-public partnerships or their role
[SPEAKER_00]: importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's much greater than on just a
project level, but actually influencing
[SPEAKER_00]: and impacting long-lasting change in this
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we need connections between the
business and the public sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: The business is obviously the reality
sector that kind of contributes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the public sector makes sure that
it kind of protects interest of the wider
[SPEAKER_00]: public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need the collaboration between the
two, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it makes it not as transient and
ephemeral.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it long-lasting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just a quick fix.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like you say, oh, we want to go
for the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll take the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have a bigger vision.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually want to work hard and make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we get any help, thank you very
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's the entrepreneurs you want to
give it to.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the folks that are going to actually
work, put in the work, and make it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all those partnerships and all that
ecosystem, you feed off each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it becomes, you don't feel like an
island so much.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: May I just add something?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to me, ecosystem means it includes
all factors for success of certain
[SPEAKER_02]: business, certain area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let me take another joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Maribor in one big event just
before the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were discussion about different
government instruments, how to trigger
[SPEAKER_02]: more entrepreneurship, more innovations,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one guy there who's running,
and he's owing one of the very important
[SPEAKER_02]: Slovenian companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, OK, I don't care what kind of
instrument will you come up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just take the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, if the money's there,
who's not going to take it?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't blame the person to go get
the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to blame the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a big entrepreneur, really,
innovator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was, I think, maybe a little bit
annoyed with the discussion going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, OK, you just come up with an
instrument.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take the money, and I'll do the rest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, too much talking, not enough action.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is there money for this type of thing
in the EU?
[SPEAKER_04]: And is there money for Slovenia?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know when one would do a tender,
for example, there's money from Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's money from the EU.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's money from Slovenia that the EU
gave back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like to say give back to Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they get to appropriate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very well put.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I always explain to people who are
somehow starting with this sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two types of EU funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: One comes directly from Brussels,
and the other one comes indirectly or
[SPEAKER_02]: directly from the home country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have four different funds that,
let's say, each home country, national
[SPEAKER_02]: country is in charge of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cohesion, which is the most known,
I would say, funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then original funds, social funds,
and also funds for agriculture and
[SPEAKER_02]: fisheries and forestry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these four funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, cohesion represents the largest
part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think probably most of you heard
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although if you make polls on the street
asking people what is cohesion,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure they would be able to answer,
but OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite huge money there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, it's direct funding coming
directly from Brussels as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's additional funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which came up after COVID, which was
connected to next generation EU.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was additional funding,
which each country got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were certain projects included
there as well in cooperation with European
[SPEAKER_02]: Commission, which has to kind of approve
them on general level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are mostly digitalization,
green economy, and similar stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm 10 years in Brussels now working
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes still a certain call
surprises me, because I never heard of
[SPEAKER_02]: that fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 10 years there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really a jungle, to be quite
honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Myself and my team, we do the best to
navigate through all of this, to know
[SPEAKER_02]: really how things work out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we helped a lot of companies,
mostly Slovenians, because we are
[SPEAKER_02]: Slovenian business association,
but also many international ones as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we basically worked for, I would say,
all EU countries already, and some non-EU
[SPEAKER_02]: countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we had some really interesting cases
from the Western Balkan, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's jungle, but you can handle it if
you have good people, good team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, if you try to swim through
this jungle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: You better wear your flippers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gentlemen, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please give it up for our esteemed panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anybody, we still have time for one or
two questions in Guile?
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have time for one or two questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone have one or two questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone have no questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone have some questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: One over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: About funding, people usually come to me
after my speech, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to ask questions publicly,
so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'll take the chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Afterwards, also, if I may.
[SPEAKER_05]: But nevertheless, we were speaking about
the funds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tamjana Golo Plauric, ECQA European
project leader, certified at our country
[SPEAKER_05]: and Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you were speaking about the funds and
about the cohesion funds, which are not
[SPEAKER_05]: applicable for the physical or private
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a different agenda.
[SPEAKER_05]: So meanwhile, when you were talking,
I was just typing in the procurement and
[SPEAKER_05]: public cause at the European Commission
portal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And regarding hemp, there is no one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So since the mechanism of European
Commission is that if there is need,
[SPEAKER_05]: sooner or later, a fund or a call has to
be defined.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is coordinated and designed from
different parts, from different European
[SPEAKER_05]: members.
[SPEAKER_05]: I suggest that if you intend to do your
public what did you call it, diversity,
[SPEAKER_05]: no, diversion event on May the 15th next
year, I suggest that you invite people
[SPEAKER_05]: from as many countries as possible,
because the need to have such a call has
[SPEAKER_05]: to come alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the European Commission can
respond.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, it won't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also been to the Horizon medical
cause and public procurements.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't have two millions of
leverage, and that means active money on
[SPEAKER_05]: your account, they are not interested.
[SPEAKER_05]: And since the hemp issue relates to the
supporting activities of either industry
[SPEAKER_05]: research or medical research, it is almost
impossible to come through.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is why we have the problem in
Ljubljana or in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have great institutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have people who do the research.
[SPEAKER_05]: But since they are not able to come to the
relevant data, either in Slovenia or in
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe, and since they don't have a person
to speak to or the referee in European
[SPEAKER_05]: Commission, it's almost mission
impossible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's your question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it how do you intend to address
European Commission with your event,
[SPEAKER_05]: with active?
[SPEAKER_02]: May I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you for your discussion and your
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually, I mean, if you listen
carefully, I said that there is no call
[SPEAKER_02]: for this industry right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I said that on the other way,
on the other hand, there are calls which
[SPEAKER_02]: are just for innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So theoretically, you could go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not called for any particular
subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just called for innovation,
innovative product, which could be
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever innovative product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So theoretically, it could be innovative
product, including cannabis, regarding
[SPEAKER_02]: industries, green economy, health,
whatever, theoretically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm talking about European Innovation
Council, which goes for this stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are six different instruments there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can go in detail if you want,
but I don't think anyone wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, that's one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we are making this idea of
this conference in Brussels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be more, I would say,
regulation and policy oriented to make
[SPEAKER_02]: aware commission about this industry,
about this potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I said at the very first beginning,
I think we should improve research in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in order with this scientific
research, these scientific results and
[SPEAKER_02]: research, persuade those who still don't
believe there is potential here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through this, the calls are far away
from, I mean, specific calls for this
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are far there, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have to start with the persuasion
and with the research, scientifically
[SPEAKER_02]: proved results of some issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Technical readiness level for each core of
innovation is at least three or four.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is impossible to develop in Slovenia,
especially if you're a small country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, first I'll say, nothing's
impossible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't really like, I don't love to
hear all that talk, but you can have a
[SPEAKER_04]: problem and you can say it's improbable,
but don't ever say it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can have, you know, again,
you can have international partners,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't mention just Slovenia,
the international community here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the calls actually ask that
you have some international or cross
[SPEAKER_02]: border partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't say just Slovenia or you cannot
do it or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quite agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it again for all the panelists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very lively discussion toward the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure they'd love to talk to you
more about it outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.
