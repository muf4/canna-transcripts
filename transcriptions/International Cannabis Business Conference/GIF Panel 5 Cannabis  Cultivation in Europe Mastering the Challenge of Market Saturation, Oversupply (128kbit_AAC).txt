[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you everybody and welcome to this
panel on cannabis cultivation in Europe
[SPEAKER_03]: mastering the challenge of market
saturation over supply and under
[SPEAKER_03]: performance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on today's panel we have David Engel,
he's CEO and president of Full Moon Real
[SPEAKER_03]: Estate Investments and Ondara.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have Adrian Fischer, he's
co-founder and managing director at
[SPEAKER_03]: DemiCAN, he's the third founder next to
the other two founders that you've seen on
[SPEAKER_03]: stage before.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the owner to have here Vera
Broder, she's the CEO of MHI Cultivo
[SPEAKER_03]: Medicinal SR as well as Alexander Rieck
who is the chief operating officer at
[SPEAKER_03]: Harper Farm GmbH, but also one of the
pioneers here in the German cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry and former CEO of Geka Pharma.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a quite interesting topic here
with the cannabis cultivation,
[SPEAKER_03]: we've heard some controversy already,
there have been some ongoing discussions
[SPEAKER_03]: already in the audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe let's start with Adrian at that
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, and see Adrian as a German producer
of medicinal cannabis, what do you think,
[SPEAKER_03]: what strategies do you employ to ensure a
consistent supply and quality to navigate
[SPEAKER_03]: a competitive European market with your
own cultivation but also with the imports
[SPEAKER_03]: that you are doing and also maybe in a
perspective on other countries that you as
[SPEAKER_03]: a company from Germany want to get active
in?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thanks for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're absolutely right, I think the
response is twofold, like the first one
[SPEAKER_08]: would be a little bit more technical on
the side of the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what's really important if you're
producing just for the medical market is
[SPEAKER_08]: consistency and control and we've
established a facility to do just that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would definitely suggest everyone who's
going into that direction to invest into
[SPEAKER_08]: two labs, which one, the first would be a
tissue culture lab, the second one would
[SPEAKER_08]: be your own QC lab.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you have full control over the
product, then consistency comes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for our domestic production,
that's our strategy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't produce any out of specification
batches because there's no second use in
[SPEAKER_08]: Germany, so everything that is out of
specification has to be destroyed and
[SPEAKER_08]: there's also no way to reroute it,
for example, for exports.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the second part I think is really
important.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're also doing is we're offering
GMP services, so we are importing GACP
[SPEAKER_08]: flowers from every producer that fulfills
GACP criteria where we do the audit,
[SPEAKER_08]: can import the flowers and we do GMP
processing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's a real important part,
also to include other people into the
[SPEAKER_08]: German market and offer flexibility to
include other peoples over the world to
[SPEAKER_08]: produce or sell in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: David, how do you perceive the European
production ecosystem and the complex
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory landscape that we have here in
Europe?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I've heard many times, the European
markets are not harmonized.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way they handle every aspect of the
GMP aspect even, the cultivation,
[SPEAKER_04]: the agencies are all learning a new
business.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a little confused by it,
so we operate, we're governed by agencies
[SPEAKER_04]: that really don't understand cannabis,
like in Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're learning cannabis, they're
learning with us, so it makes it very
[SPEAKER_04]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no right answer always.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just pick up the phone and call
a consultant and get an answer,
[SPEAKER_04]: so it's a complex regulatory situation as
everyone learns how to navigate this
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, this herbal medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as the cultivation goes,
you made a good point, Adrian.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to control every aspect of your
operation from the tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics, which are highly preferred to
prevent problems in your crop,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also it's very important that your
systems and your cultivation facility are
[SPEAKER_04]: designed properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where a lot of folks go wrong in
the States and in Canada in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done about everything you can screw
up, we screwed it up in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're hopefully done screwing things up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every aspect of temperature, humidity
control, drying methodologies,
[SPEAKER_04]: every aspect has to be precisely on are
you gonna have a bad product, are you
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna have a product that fails or out of
spec or what have you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my two cents on that one anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vera, you're one of the pioneers in
Portugal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell us what were the factors that
contributed to the successful
[SPEAKER_03]: establishment of the cannabis cultivation
operation in Portugal and how can Portugal
[SPEAKER_03]: leverage its advantage that it has and
maybe you can give us a quick overview on
[SPEAKER_03]: where the Portuguese market stands at this
point in terms of cultivation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you, Lisa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Portugal has been very accommodating to
the medical cannabis industry in the sense
[SPEAKER_02]: that it opened up its doors for
investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, the regulatory
framework is very conservative and one
[SPEAKER_02]: must understand that when one invests in
cultivation in medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_02]: Portugal, it is a long path.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the pharma path in a very
conservative European structure and many
[SPEAKER_02]: companies when they enter the cultivation,
they are not entirely understanding of the
[SPEAKER_02]: pharma path and that has created many
difficult situations for the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry alike all over Europe
and that's a bit the situation in
[SPEAKER_02]: Portugal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many, many licenses, many license
submissions, many companies that were set
[SPEAKER_02]: up and haven't made it through because you
really need to take a deep breath and walk
[SPEAKER_02]: through every little path.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first mover advantage is definitely
critical for success.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alex, what is your perception?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean you're active in Germany and you
have operation cooperation in North
[SPEAKER_03]: Macedonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are cultivation markets going and
what are some key considerations when
[SPEAKER_03]: setting up a production facility still?
[SPEAKER_06]: The most important thing is that you have
a very good team.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have in North Macedonia an amazing
headquarter and a very well-educated team
[SPEAKER_06]: and they are taking control of the
cultivation 24 hours, seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: You always have to control all the lights,
nutrition, water, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, you cannot sleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to control the environment,
et cetera, the whole time and the problem
[SPEAKER_06]: is to cultivate a product in the same
amount with the same THC content so that
[SPEAKER_06]: you have the specifications.
[SPEAKER_06]: You always have to produce within the
specifications otherwise you cannot sell
[SPEAKER_06]: the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: For example in Germany when it's
registered as a 21 THC flower then you
[SPEAKER_06]: cannot sell it as a 25% THC flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not possible and yeah, when it
comes to new market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm in the industry since 2017 and what
I really, I was always surprised that the
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivators they have big dreams and big
ideas and they said we are now building
[SPEAKER_06]: the state of the art facility,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's good to do the homework but you
should also know the market where you want
[SPEAKER_06]: to sell your products.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the end a lot of producers came to
me in the past and said hey, Alexander now
[SPEAKER_06]: we have the grow and four tons and we are
now looking for customers, can you help
[SPEAKER_06]: us?
[SPEAKER_06]: I said no, now it's too late.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have come earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, in best case or I want to give an
example for the Polish market.
[SPEAKER_06]: The registration of the product will take
you 12, 16 months or more even.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's very conservative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's looking to Poland right now
because it's a very interesting market.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no insurance paying the cost for
the patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm always surprised that I
hear that it's a very big market but if
[SPEAKER_06]: you know some people there they will tell
you and I think what is really important
[SPEAKER_06]: when you enter new market you should also
know the regulations side by yourself and
[SPEAKER_06]: have very good contacts who are also very
good informed what they are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we heard this topic of consistency
before and stable genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: David, you work with genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your stance on how do you see the
role of genetics in overcoming market
[SPEAKER_03]: saturation to a certain extent and under
performance challenges in the European
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: What role do genetics play in this
equation?
[SPEAKER_04]: I see genetics as vitally important to
being competitive in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw the phenomenon in Canada where
certain genetics would become popular and
[SPEAKER_04]: then everybody's got their hands on those
genetics and started growing them and then
[SPEAKER_04]: the prices just plummet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we bought a genetics bank and we have a
genetics company where we phenohunt about
[SPEAKER_04]: 950 high THC genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have some one to ones and CBD
genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we think that where we can stand out
in the market is we can provide importers
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabis, flowers and other products.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can provide them the exclusive genetic
from our genetics bank that they can
[SPEAKER_04]: choose and only they would have access to
those particular genetics that we license
[SPEAKER_04]: to them permanently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's where you can stand out
in the market as a distributor to have
[SPEAKER_04]: access to the best genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're totally introducing new genetics
over time every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep a really fresh variation of genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also prefer to start with tissue
culture clones from our cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adrian, you're also doing tissue culture
and you're also focused on genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think is the role of genetics
and also in scaling cultivation operations
[SPEAKER_03]: or making genetics available potentially
for home cultivation and those kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: topics?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your stance on that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we're thinking very much alike here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is also one of the focuses we're
having.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as a little background, in Germany
we're quite limited with which strains we
[SPEAKER_08]: can grow currently under our government
contract.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we are not limited for which strains
we can do R&D.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've began that already when we
started our company.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fino hunted our first strains and now are
running a lot more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fino hunts using our TC lab and preparing
a strain database for Germany,
[SPEAKER_08]: especially when there's a rec market with
the potential of cannabis social clubs
[SPEAKER_08]: coming online but also for our home
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there's great demand for not
only good and stable genetics but also
[SPEAKER_08]: clean genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that many kinds of different
diseases are very prevalent, especially in
[SPEAKER_08]: the US market.
[SPEAKER_08]: But since we are now also having lots of
US genetics here in Europe, all that has
[SPEAKER_08]: come over.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a really important thing to have
something ready in that direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's also something that we
definitely would like to offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vera, we already have here a couple of
overlaps in what you guys are all doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you say is some of the lessons
learned from you in Portugal about
[SPEAKER_03]: collaboration and competitiveness in
Europe itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Collaboration is critical because this is
a starting industry, especially in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of experience coming from
North America, from Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Europe, it's a whole different
ballgame.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pharma regulation is completely
different than it is in North America or
[SPEAKER_02]: Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the market in itself has a lot of
potential, but we're far from reaching the
[SPEAKER_02]: potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we all work together and manage to
find the path to help educate the market,
[SPEAKER_02]: educate the doctors, help with the
regulatory path, ensure that the
[SPEAKER_02]: governments understand the pharma
economics and the sustainability that
[SPEAKER_02]: medical cannabis can bring to them in
terms of less expenditure with hospital
[SPEAKER_02]: beds, with drugs that can be harmful and
create worse expenses to the government,
[SPEAKER_02]: creating also, establishing, dividing
amongst us the cultivation and the entry
[SPEAKER_02]: as we ourselves, Medicaid Portugal,
are also cultivators and an EUGMP
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a manufacturing facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have strategic partnerships in
terms of genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So together, we can unite rather than be
competitors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to collaborate and let each other
outstand in their expertise to make this a
[SPEAKER_02]: more successful established industry and
avoid the pitfalls and the mistakes done
[SPEAKER_02]: in North America and Israel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alex, what do you say, what role does
collaboration play and how can everyone
[SPEAKER_03]: address these issues of oversaturation and
ensure that there is a more effective
[SPEAKER_03]: distribution of products in the market?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The authorities in Germany are very
different and to get products into the
[SPEAKER_06]: market is often a challenge for foreign
producers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the end, to make an example,
Bavaria, you can import medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: flowers as an API.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you irradiate them, then you need an
approval by the German Bee Farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it must be cultivated under GMB
conditions and the development last six or
[SPEAKER_06]: seven years.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very good development.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have now the knowledge with all the
audits and all the GMP, GSEP, GDP
[SPEAKER_06]: guidelines.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a way from the old
pharmaceutical market into the medical
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the development, I would say,
is very good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, you still have to take some
challenges in Germany because,
[SPEAKER_06]: for example, I know an example from
Northland, Westphalia, they have to
[SPEAKER_06]: produce under GMP conditions in the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe another company has to do it
under GSEP conditions to produce a
[SPEAKER_06]: product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes it's not easy for producers
to launch products here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, we have an oversupply in the
German market right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2017, I thought, hey, when everybody
built their facility, we have so much
[SPEAKER_06]: supply worldwide.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who can smoke all the flowers and take the
extracts?
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the end, OK, we have an oversupply.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would say every company has to focus
on themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be something on stock you
cannot sell in the industry or in the
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the end, that will come to this
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was clear in the past.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you have to survive and offer a
very high quality product.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a patient-driven market.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a market for the flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the end, I would say, focus on
yourself, on your goals.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also think about new formulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, now we have flowers, extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of companies are thinking about
more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And new dosage forms, et cetera,
are the key for the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great keyword that you are
saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would have been my follow-up
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you see the role of pharmaceutical
practices and standards in shaping the
[SPEAKER_03]: future of the whole European cannabis
industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: You always have to control everything from
the GMP cultivation, GACP cultivation,
[SPEAKER_06]: GDP.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the end, the monography and all the
NRS out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have a new one for cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to know everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the one thing has an effect
or an impact on the other thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Often, the pharmaceutical entrepreneur
says, OK, my responsibility ends at the
[SPEAKER_06]: door of the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the end, you should also know the
challenges for the pharmacies,
[SPEAKER_06]: because they are giving it to the
patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you produce something, and in the
end, it's not compliant with the NF or
[SPEAKER_06]: something like that, then you have a good
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you cannot give it to the patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another interesting aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adrian, you're a physician also.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking here about cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody can cultivate.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the end, we need some prescribers who
are putting everything on a prescription
[SPEAKER_03]: so the patient can have access.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell us a little bit, maybe,
about what kind of legwork is necessary
[SPEAKER_03]: for advancing medical knowledge and
improving patient access?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think that's something that
people are underestimating a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, of course, education is one of the
most important things.
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as it's still a purely medical
market, there might be some changes coming
[SPEAKER_08]: up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're probably aware of the draft
legislation that is coming out that might
[SPEAKER_08]: be that the status of cannabis as a
narcotic changes, and it becomes an Rx
[SPEAKER_08]: that would at least help prescription in a
lot of ways that it makes it much easier
[SPEAKER_08]: for many doctors to prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think what people underestimate
when I talk to my former colleagues for
[SPEAKER_08]: example, from my studies, many of them
have never given out a narcotic drug
[SPEAKER_08]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that is relatively unusual
to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really something new.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're, for example, doing is we're
inviting doctors over to our facility and
[SPEAKER_08]: providing a first-hand impression on how
medical cannabis is cultivated so that
[SPEAKER_08]: they also can see the product,
smell the plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So far, the feedback has been really,
really positive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if you invite people that you don't
invite because they are already in the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis field, but you invite them
because they are at the farthest possible
[SPEAKER_08]: away from it, the feedback was always very
positive that when they learn and
[SPEAKER_08]: understand what cannabis can do,
that they are supportive of it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: David, maybe back to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are other risks and opportunities
that you see associated with investing in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis cultivation ventures,
especially considering that we have these
[SPEAKER_03]: fragmented market dynamics and regulatory
hurdles in Europe?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I woke up this morning and received
an article on my phone from Forbes
[SPEAKER_04]: Magazine, and it said that canopy growth
has destroyed 19 billion US of value over
[SPEAKER_04]: the last five or six years.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got about 400 million left that
said they're going to be insolvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the risks of importers of
cannabis flowers from Canada and elsewhere
[SPEAKER_04]: is the supply chain risk of the underlying
companies they're bringing in from.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's very much pain in Canada right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: All companies are losing bunches of money,
not all attributable to Europe,
[SPEAKER_04]: of course, but there's a supply chain risk
when bringing in from suppliers that
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't reliable longer term.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I would do is hitch my wagon to
someone that's going to be there a while
[SPEAKER_04]: and not losing money.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Canadians right now are able to sell
product below cost because they have an
[SPEAKER_04]: unlimited public money supply for right
now, but that'll soon change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think sticking together, partnering
with suppliers that are there for the long
[SPEAKER_04]: run, I think is key to being a successful
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: A successful distribution company in the
long term.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as far as the capital markets
right now, the sentiment for cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: capital is as low as I've ever seen it
because the sentiment in the US,
[SPEAKER_04]: the sentiment in Canada, the sentiment
really never got too euphoric in Europe,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the sentiment's as low as I've seen
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was telling somebody, last time I asked
somebody for equity in a cannabis company,
[SPEAKER_04]: they punched me in the face.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a popular thing right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes it very challenging for
companies out there to expand their
[SPEAKER_04]: operation, build or grows, do things
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happens in the cannabis business
in the states and elsewhere, companies
[SPEAKER_04]: tend to cut corners on the design of their
facilities because they don't have access
[SPEAKER_04]: to capital, they do things wrong,
they don't set it up right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very important that you design facilities
to control the cultivation process
[SPEAKER_04]: precisely.
[SPEAKER_04]: We spared no expense in Spain as we built
out our, well we acquired the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's 1.6 million square feet state of the
art, but on the conversion of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: on a small portion of that, we spared no
expense to make sure we had control of
[SPEAKER_04]: every aspect of the cultivation process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that cost a lot of money, but I knew
that if we didn't do it, we'd be in
[SPEAKER_04]: trouble, like many of those before us that
have had trouble with cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see it in Portugal, not you,
but some companies have ceased operations
[SPEAKER_04]: because they had trouble with cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about a thousand things that can go
wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have the proper facilities to
produce that cannabis reliably,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're gonna run into a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Vera, you're a marketer and you studied
business administration and business
[SPEAKER_03]: management in Boston and in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you think, what strategies
should be employed to establish and expand
[SPEAKER_03]: the presence in global cannabis markets?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you approach building corporate
partnerships or how are you dealing with
[SPEAKER_03]: this topic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I think that David touched a bit on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a time in the industry where
consolidation needs to occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of companies struggling
because they did cut corners and did not
[SPEAKER_02]: manage to create the infrastructures that
are required to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said before, Lisa, that growing
cannabis, anybody can grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true, anybody can grow cannabis,
but not anybody can grow it properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the biggest struggle in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't cut corners, like David says,
and if you do, invest everything that it
[SPEAKER_02]: takes to grow a proper flower,
then your chances to make it are very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the point is that there are so many
companies struggling and so many that
[SPEAKER_02]: don't deserve to struggle because they are
very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we need to take B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep our eyes open and find them and
consolidate our efforts because that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: path to this new era in cannabis,
in medical cannabis, to pave the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing is to stay ahead of the game
and make sure to be innovative.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an R&D division in Israel that is
working on new pathologies, on new
[SPEAKER_02]: formulations for pathologies, and that's
the future for this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as cultivation is going,
it's becoming increasingly more difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: The investment is very heavy and the price
of the cannabis flower is being is going
[SPEAKER_02]: down tremendously to the point of a
commodity where the pharma regulation does
[SPEAKER_02]: not allow it to be a commodity priced
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where we need to focus,
to focus on consolidation, to focus on
[SPEAKER_02]: where we can make a difference and to make
sure that the governments and the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory regimes that keep us working
will help us sustain this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing is the sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was spoken before, how sustainability
is critical in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is this common misconception that
only indoor cultivation is correct and
[SPEAKER_02]: keeps, makes consistency and allows for
high quality flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you have to consider that countries
like Portugal or Spain or sun-driven
[SPEAKER_02]: countries where we can expand on
greenhouse and enjoy the benefits of what
[SPEAKER_02]: nature provides us while lowering our
footprint are definitely the path forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's have a warm round of applause
before we open the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any questions in the audience?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Bert van Dijn from the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I actually see when you have a
mature plant-based industry, then usually
[SPEAKER_07]: you have separate professional breeding
companies, small number, then you have a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of producers cultivating the crop and
then you have a limited number of
[SPEAKER_07]: processing industry making maybe half
products and then you have companies that
[SPEAKER_07]: make the final products like food or
medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I see is in the cannabis industry,
this is not happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's out of balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a major problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how can we change that and just invest
in a few very professional breeding
[SPEAKER_07]: companies, have good producers,
cultivators and have a good professional
[SPEAKER_07]: processing industry for medicines,
pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think now what I see is that
companies tend to do everything from
[SPEAKER_07]: breeding up to making the products.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe they're all very specialized
businesses that need to be in different
[SPEAKER_07]: companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your answer first, Adrian?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_08]: The regulatory framework is just very
difficult in the current situation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you think about a nursery concept,
it's currently pretty complicated to
[SPEAKER_08]: export plants from one facility to another
in another country.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've seen that that's happening in
most of the states in the US.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's definitely moving in that
direction, but the framework is just very
[SPEAKER_08]: complicated to make it possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even then for the pharmaceutical
production, that's just begun,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all learning how to do it,
how to do it right to do something and do
[SPEAKER_08]: audits from other companies work together.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty convinced that it's going in
that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: In that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, I think it's good to get an
understanding of all the steps a little
[SPEAKER_08]: bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, like you said, when there is no
fully established industry, I think it's
[SPEAKER_08]: good for you to know a bit of a bit of all
the process in the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be in the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: How long it takes to get there,
that's very difficult to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think depends on changes in
regulatory frameworks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody wants to add anything?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you separate during the supply
chain, you have somebody who's doing the
[SPEAKER_06]: extraction, et cetera, the logistic
companies, everybody is working together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that they are not separated from
each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the end, yes, we have a lot of
companies who are taking parts of this
[SPEAKER_06]: supply chain to get the product from the
cultivation in the end to the pharmacies
[SPEAKER_06]: in Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if there are many companies
in the market right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: But is it more complicated if you do it
company or everybody's doing, let's say
[SPEAKER_06]: the extraction, the next is responsible
for the logistics part or you do it
[SPEAKER_06]: in-house like Harper does?
[SPEAKER_06]: In the end, it's always very complex and
that there will not everybody will survive
[SPEAKER_06]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's also a part of the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you can speak to hemp
cultivation in terms of industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding is at this point,
we have Mercedes, Audi, as well as BMW
[SPEAKER_00]: having adopted biocarbon stemming from
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you see the role of all of that
here in Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most of the panelists here have
their focus more on the medical part.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the industrial hemp part is not really
represented in this panel, I reckon.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want, I can connect you to the
expert in our industry association in
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: For that topic and then you can discuss it
with him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask you then on the medical side
because there's been a lot of discussion
[SPEAKER_05]: of THC derived from hemp or different
terpenes derived from hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp and cannabis are really the same
thing except for the THC level.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very tricky thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to talk more about standard of
identity of individual products and on the
[SPEAKER_03]: complete value chain that they are
produced in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here we are looking at medical value
chains.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something completely different than
the hemp value chains that are mostly laid
[SPEAKER_03]: out for producing fiber and seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you really look at these things
like cannabinoids and cannabis resin,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's still in the bad schedule of the
global drug policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we all have to do something in that
regard to first free that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the therapeutic potential can be used
and the industrial potential for
[SPEAKER_03]: cosmetics, for foods and other fast moving
consumer goods like smokables,
[SPEAKER_03]: inhalables and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's an entire different panel,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that was exactly my question
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to delve into the food and the
nutrient aspects of cannabis because the
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion is market saturation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just anecdotally, like in Canada,
Portugal last year, I had a bunch of old
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers coming to me and saying,
hey, how do I rip up all my apple trees
[SPEAKER_01]: and replace it all with hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I rip up all my banana trees and
replace it with hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, you know, hemp for what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer was universally flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, you know,
we've already seen that in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everyone dove in to do flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, there's still plenty of
medical or at least health related
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents, aspects that the
constituents of this plant can provide,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as that oil, such as the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm vegan and a lot of my protein
comes from hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great vegan ingredient,
but that is something that we need to
[SPEAKER_03]: discuss more.
[SPEAKER_03]: But alone in the medical sector,
we can already see that there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: oversupply.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen the same thing in CBD actually,
like there was a spike, it was a hype.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will talk about it in my presentation in
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after that hype, like we had a couple
of hundred companies that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: consolidated.
[SPEAKER_03]: The prices of the entire market have
dropped.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three years ago or four years ago,
you could get over 20,000 euro for a kilo
[SPEAKER_03]: of CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: That costs you now 600 euros.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all this market is messed up as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, this is all negatively affected
by the drug status.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something we need to work on so
we can really use the economic potential,
[SPEAKER_03]: use it as a foodstuff and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Europe here, we have the additional
challenge of novel food, where,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, cannabinoids need to be
registered so they are safe and can be
[SPEAKER_03]: handed out on a safe scale to end
consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear from the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have anything?
[SPEAKER_05]: We have like two minutes left.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything else you want to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any more questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there one more question?
[SPEAKER_03]: In regard to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've taught them everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it again for the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
Thank you.
