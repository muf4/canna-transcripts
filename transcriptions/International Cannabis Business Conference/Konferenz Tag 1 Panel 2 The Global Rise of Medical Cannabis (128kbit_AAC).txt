[SPEAKER_08]: Hi guys, thank you so much for joining us
for the global rise of medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Lily Temperton, I'm an
international cannabis analyst.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm Georgia Glick, head of
partnerships at Hanway Associates.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are an advisory firm and we offer
research, regulatory affairs and we focus
[SPEAKER_07]: on new market entry strategies for
pharmaceutical and medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: companies across Europe and Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alongside authoring reports through our
publishing arm for the first Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_07]: While most panels today will focus on the
largest medical market, Germany,
[SPEAKER_07]: in today's session we will zoom out and
take a macro view across the global
[SPEAKER_07]: medical cannabis sector to discuss some of
the key trends, market dynamics and
[SPEAKER_07]: considerations when operating in new
regions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Outside of Germany, we see a number of
interesting medical cannabis frameworks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Australia and the UK in particular have
seen notable growth rates in the last few
[SPEAKER_07]: years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with the limited pilot in France and
unique frameworks in Italy and Portugal,
[SPEAKER_07]: there is a lot to discuss.
[SPEAKER_07]: Despite this, there are still regulatory
blockers hindering these medical markets.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we also want to discuss some of those
hindrances today.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a pleasure to be joined by such a
diverse set of panelists today who are
[SPEAKER_08]: going to bring operational and expertise
from a range of markets.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I'd love to hand over to them to
introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my name is Lisa Haag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm founder and CEO of MJ Universe GmbH.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a strategic advisory company,
but we also operate our own projects,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, Crowdinvest.de.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Willkommen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Danke f√ºr your shining.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mein Name ist Alex Revich.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been coming here since 2017,
helping Alex Rogers with ICBC,
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing lots of Canadians with me here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in the industry since October
2013, so almost 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of fun, a lot of ups and downs,
which we'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I work with Loosh Brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a contract manufacturer of edibles
in Canada, and I have a pharmacy called
[SPEAKER_03]: Hybrid Farm, where we are the only
pharmacy in North America that has medical
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis on site.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, I'm Gosia Menyeh, and I'm chief
strategic officer from Hapa Farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are a pharmaceutical company from
Germany, having fully integrated operation
[SPEAKER_05]: in North Macedonia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm still living in Israel, but two weeks
from now I will move to Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have almost five years' experience
in medical cannabis also from Israeli
[SPEAKER_05]: companies, so I would like to share some
experience related to regulation in
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe, which we gained last four years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Fleeta.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am from Little Green Farmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Little Green Farmer is an Australian
and a Danish producer of medical grade
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis medicines.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have operations in Australia and in
Denmark.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're vertically integrated, and we are
exporting these medicines across the globe
[SPEAKER_06]: to patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a really big focus on the
European market.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's such a special market, and really
looking forward to joining this great
[SPEAKER_06]: panel today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for being here and listening
to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to kick off today by talking a
little bit about patient access and
[SPEAKER_07]: medical frameworks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gosia and Fleeta, you both have experience
operating in a number of key emerging
[SPEAKER_07]: markets, such as Australia, Portugal,
and Poland.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm keen to hear from both of you maybe to
kick off.
[SPEAKER_07]: How has the over or the under regulation
led to supply shortages for patients or a
[SPEAKER_07]: lack of diversity in product formats?
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's go back a step if I can.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's really important to
recognize that each country has its own
[SPEAKER_06]: unique regulation or regime.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it comes back to which
business, and I'm just going to speak at a
[SPEAKER_06]: business front to begin with, is what is
the business model to begin with?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because which markets do you want to play
in?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's not like you can send to
Germany and you can send to all the
[SPEAKER_06]: countries in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: The EU are just not aligned like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was a big learning curve coming
from Australia when we exported through a
[SPEAKER_06]: mutual recognition agreement initially
into Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to understand the unique
jurisdictions legislation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because of that, the patient access
system is really different in each of
[SPEAKER_06]: these markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Australia, it's a huge demand at the
moment there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And our patients access it through a
special access program through GPs and
[SPEAKER_06]: specialists who can prescribe,
whereby there are other countries in the
[SPEAKER_06]: UK very restricted in terms of patient
access at the moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, it's only specialists that
they're actually prescribing there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, look, France is a very different
kettle of fish altogether.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just a pilot program.
[SPEAKER_06]: Several companies, including Little Green
Farmer, are a part of that trial.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, it's a very closed system.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we hope that that will catalyze in the
next coming years to a legal market there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess coming back to your question
just about the product registration side
[SPEAKER_06]: of things, every country is different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it might have to be approved by the
local authorities.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you look at Poland, for example,
you have to go through a product
[SPEAKER_06]: registration process or a marketing
authorization process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the same for Portugal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that can take two to three years to
actually happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, when it's over-regulated,
it is very hard for patients to access
[SPEAKER_06]: because there are limited products
available.
[SPEAKER_06]: But often, that's how an industry actually
begins.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I will also add.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we have very similar experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would like to add mainly that when
the countries out of Europe, like Israel,
[SPEAKER_05]: Australia, or Canada, for example,
want to enter European market,
[SPEAKER_05]: first, it's not only business strategy,
but it's mainly regulatory strategy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you are really cracking regulatory path
country by country.
[SPEAKER_05]: How you can register your product?
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, what is the frames,
regulatory frames?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because some countries, as you said,
are very similar approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Magistar formulation, we know that
it's in Germany, in Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_05]: in Italy, in Poland, and some other
European countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for example, Poland, my origin
country, is very specific because you have
[SPEAKER_05]: to submit full marketing authorization
dossier of pharmaceutical raw material.
[SPEAKER_05]: It means if you are registering like
propylene glycol, or I don't know,
[SPEAKER_05]: any other solvent, it's the same heavy
quality dossier like medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can say that the patient will wait
for a little green pharma product,
[SPEAKER_05]: for example, in Poland, up to two years
for flowers, and maybe up to four or five
[SPEAKER_05]: years for extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how is going on now in Poland?
[SPEAKER_05]: On the market, you have maybe like in real
life, in the pharmacy, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_05]: four or five type of different flowers,
and only one or two extracts, which is
[SPEAKER_05]: crazy if you compare it with German
markets, which is oversaturated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, more than 100 different
flowers and maybe 80 or 90 different
[SPEAKER_05]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the doctors in Germany, they don't know
how to even prescribe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like, from French, we can say for
the patients and doctors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what is going on back to Poland?
[SPEAKER_05]: Poland also, that even the registered
products, which are prescribed by the
[SPEAKER_05]: doctors, are high THC, and only one flower
is balanced CBD THC 8.8.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if patients are searching for CBD
flowers, for example, CBD products,
[SPEAKER_05]: they will go to the hem shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any problem with the hem
shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the regulation for these CBD food
supplement products are not so strict,
[SPEAKER_05]: not controlled.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes the labels, we don't know
what is inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that regulation, yes,
but maybe not over regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for sure, we should control quality of
the products, because we know very well,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not only the label regarding the API
content, but also the heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_05]: so all the toxins, which can be very toxic
for the patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, I think that in Europe,
we are struggling with this lack of
[SPEAKER_05]: harmonization from European Union,
because we know that from pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, there's always the harmonized
pass to access the European market.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in case of cannabis, it's really
national pass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so many countries still are waiting to
have the regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are all waiting how the European
Pharmacopeia or HMPC, for example,
[SPEAKER_05]: will classify medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the patient are like initiators
of regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see it in Spain, for example,
it's still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll see, we are looking forward what
will be the next steps.
[SPEAKER_05]: But France also was initiated by the
Association of Patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we still have this extension of one
additional year of French pilot project.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully, next year, we'll have the
regulation in France to let the patient
[SPEAKER_05]: have regular access and control access to
the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: A very similar way that we started in
Canada, very challenging at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we first started, we would ask people
to go to their doctor to get their
[SPEAKER_03]: authorization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would say, my doctor doesn't
authorize.
[SPEAKER_03]: They threaten to kick me out of their
clinic if I use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was in 2013.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to create cannabis clinics,
which are ways for patients to come in and
[SPEAKER_03]: get educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, licensed producers had to fund
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we couldn't pay doctors, because
that's illegal, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had to find other ways to fund it,
because no one else was funding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, the patients would be paying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't want the patients to pay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happened was, now with
legalization, the doctors are no longer
[SPEAKER_03]: scared that they're the gatekeeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were before forced to be the
controller of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if the doctor didn't authorize,
no one was getting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's how they felt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were worried about the college
coming down on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now the recreational happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people can just go buy cannabis across
the street everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone who goes to a doctor are actual
real medical patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no longer are doctors afraid anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we are 10 years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a quick thought on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that taps into something.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Lisa, I know we were having a quick
chat about just before we came in,
[SPEAKER_08]: which was how a lot of the market dialogue
is about how flower still dominates.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's various reasoning for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, doctors have conflicting
preferences sometimes of preferring a more
[SPEAKER_08]: controlled dose extracted product.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what are the kind of dynamics that are
at play here?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just potentially patient trends,
but price and accessibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what we have to understand in
Germany is that there are different groups
[SPEAKER_01]: of patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are patients that get their
prescription via the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the doctor suggests it, because he may
think that's the best type of therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that's still the least
common variant, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have these patients who are voluntary
or involuntary self-payers that are mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: in the flower section, where there's also
huge, huge kind of availability of
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the good thing that we can say is
that prices, meanwhile, are below illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: market prices, which I think is a very
great achievement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, we have a lot of bottlenecks
that patients have to jump through in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to get a prescription, in order to
get maybe reimbursement by the health
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see that this is an ongoing
discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that the government is trying to make
some improvements in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last week, for example, Ms. Kappert-Gontha
was on the panel here before.
[SPEAKER_01]: She announced that there will be a
shortage of the time you have to wait
[SPEAKER_01]: until your application can be approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, there may be some doctors where
the application does not need to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they can just prescribe,
which would also be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's baby steps and baby steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really developing on a micro
level, if you want to say so.
[SPEAKER_08]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in terms of that blur, as you say,
between people liking it and finding it
[SPEAKER_08]: easier and actually better quality
products often from the illicit market,
[SPEAKER_08]: do you think the entrance, and maybe Alex,
you'll also have some insight here from
[SPEAKER_08]: Canada, of the entrance of categories like
live rosin and hash and more kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: recreational style formats, carts,
for example, can help with some of this
[SPEAKER_08]: and can help bring patients on that
potentially a nose into flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get this question all the time
coming to Berlin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: People in Europe love to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Israel loves to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are certain places that they just
love to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: But bless you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the difference is these other forms
are just much better medical products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here I am so many years later having
the same discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you allow these other formats in,
they're a lot more consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a lot more clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I love flower as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're talking about medicine,
there's just so many better ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're making the joke backstage how in
California, when I was there a few years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago, they talk about distillate as hot dog
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is like the lowest form of input.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, if you can't afford a higher
input, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for those that can and want to,
hash rosin, live rosin, these are way more
[SPEAKER_03]: pure, full spectrum, much better effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can try five milligrams of distillate
versus five milligrams of hash rosin
[SPEAKER_03]: edible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we're not talking about that
yet in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just starting to get your markets
established.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is where it's going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you need to kind of prepare for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially as a medical product,
I'm sorry, smoking cannabis as a medicine,
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it seems like that's what you're
fighting for.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're going to be like five to 10
years in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll be like, oh my god,
I can't even believe we were even saying
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just add on to that as well?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the concentrates,
whether it's live rosin, resin,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're very pure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the volume and the intake is probably
lower.
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about finding a way to do that safely
and obviously to register those processes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's not forget that it's less
unadulterated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And therefore, the entourage effect,
which we all know, will play a really big
[SPEAKER_06]: part.
[SPEAKER_06]: Less terpenes are lost, less active
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we're mad to think it's not
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a matter of when and how.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to add regarding the also
product and back to the regulatory
[SPEAKER_05]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are facing in Europe still the problem
that we have only two countries currently
[SPEAKER_05]: in Europe allowing finished product
registration.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have Portugal and we have France.
[SPEAKER_05]: But France is still under this pilot
trial.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we cannot introduce the new product
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is also like a kind of problem
for the companies, pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_05]: companies, to bring distillate or purified
extract to the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when you have the most regulation
under magister formulation, you are
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing to the pharmacies kind of
pharmaceutical raw material.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the pharmacist must formulate,
continue formulating under magister
[SPEAKER_05]: formulation the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that in Poland, I told you that
there is only a few flowers and one or two
[SPEAKER_05]: extracts registered.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the pharmacies, Polish pharmacies,
are very innovative.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how they are doing, because for
information you can have by prescription
[SPEAKER_05]: in Poland a purified extra 85% THC with
the prescription legally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how it's going on, it's pharmacies has
really these pharmacy, the extraction
[SPEAKER_05]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's doing this ancient way extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he has a crude extract, then he's
standardizing it and then purifying to
[SPEAKER_05]: obtain this highly purified 85% extract
for the vaporization.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, it's possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only one product currently in Poland.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously from like even price
perspective, Poland has no reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything is from the pocket of the
patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they can access these vapes if we can
know from legal sources and especially
[SPEAKER_05]: with the high quality and purity.
[SPEAKER_05]: But regarding also about the purified
extract, every patient is aware about
[SPEAKER_05]: entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not only searching for THC,
CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: The patient we know are searching for
specific terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's also the way to enrich these
purified extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's our role now as a
pharmaceutical company is to bring to the
[SPEAKER_05]: market maybe complementary.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say food supplement,
but why not the blend of the terpenes to
[SPEAKER_05]: complete, like to give away a package or
kit for the patient, which medical doctor
[SPEAKER_05]: can supervise and advise, for example,
because we have this large knowledge about
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes or even other synergistic
herbals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is something which we must as
pharmaceutical companies to introduce
[SPEAKER_05]: because we are limited by this regulatory
path of magisterial formulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, hope that most of the
countries will allow to have finished
[SPEAKER_05]: product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And along with that will come education,
because it's so key to educate our
[SPEAKER_06]: stakeholders, including our doctors,
how to prescribe such different products
[SPEAKER_06]: and unique delivery systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you mentioned earlier, obviously,
the fact that in Australia, general
[SPEAKER_07]: practitioners can prescribe, which
obviously we don't have yet in the UK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you say there are any other factors
that have contributed to this growth that
[SPEAKER_07]: we've seen in the Australian medical
market in particular?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there are a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first one is actually doctor
education.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that is huge now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up to us as producers and everybody
in this room to have a part in the
[SPEAKER_06]: education process, because that's how an
industry evolves.
[SPEAKER_06]: It obviously starts from patient demand,
but then we need to educate doctors.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the 80-20 rule.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll have a handful of doctors who
are your main prescribers, but that's
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got over 5,000 prescribers now in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other reason, and it's there,
we haven't really talked about it,
[SPEAKER_06]: and that is in most markets, it's the
quasi-medical, where the recreation and
[SPEAKER_06]: those using it for self-medicating
purposes access it legally through the
[SPEAKER_06]: regime or the legal process, because why
not?
[SPEAKER_06]: You would argue that the quality is safer
just in terms of extraction techniques and
[SPEAKER_06]: what have you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get the consistent same supply all the
time, and most importantly, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will also add something regarding the
education of the doctors, and thank you,
[SPEAKER_05]: Flita, for touching these sensitive
points.
[SPEAKER_05]: After education, of course, because they
are used to have the clinical data or some
[SPEAKER_05]: support, and we know all that this plant
we are discovering every day, some
[SPEAKER_05]: publication, and there is a lot of
clinical trials, observations,
[SPEAKER_05]: and studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But after the trainings, we know it's from
France, for example, the doctors must
[SPEAKER_05]: practice and then have this relationship
with the patient very close to take the
[SPEAKER_05]: feedbacks from there, because it's
constant interaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will add also in this relationship,
the pharmacist, so back to France,
[SPEAKER_05]: we know that the first year, the doctors
were prescribing a high-CBD product to
[SPEAKER_05]: treat the pain, and after a few months,
patients were just not happy, and they
[SPEAKER_05]: asked to withdraw from the project,
because they didn't receive any relief.
[SPEAKER_05]: So only after one year, the French doctors
they just learned that maybe they should
[SPEAKER_05]: start titration with the balanced product,
and then obviously start slow and low,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that increase this content of THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there is the huge stigma about
THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone is very afraid of THC,
and the doctors need to practice and have
[SPEAKER_05]: interaction, because it's really like
personalized medicine, so close
[SPEAKER_05]: interaction with the patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the other countries, like Magistar
formulation, in this dual, we have to add
[SPEAKER_05]: the pharmacist, because it's really like
pharmacist who is doing this Magistar
[SPEAKER_05]: formulation, but he may do it only if he
has a prescription.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if, for example, you would like to
introduce some very innovative formats,
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, some topicals, or even,
I don't know, a liposomal solution,
[SPEAKER_05]: we have to first of all educate the
doctors that, yes, we will introduce it
[SPEAKER_05]: through the pharmacist, so we are
initiating the prescription, then the
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmacist is formulating in the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you actually said something really
important, the follow-up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did tons of doctor education.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't practice, it doesn't do
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we would say to them is,
why don't you find a few patients that
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing else is working for, try those
patients, and then follow up with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what the doctors found, because I
would go to a lot of medical conferences
[SPEAKER_03]: every year, and I would see the same
doctors, and at first they were very
[SPEAKER_03]: skeptical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they were like, you know,
I tried it with a few patients,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know, it's kind of working.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the funny things they would say
to me is, you know, either this cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff is working, or all the patients are
coming together and agreeing on what
[SPEAKER_03]: they're saying to me, because they're all
saying the same thing, and either it's
[SPEAKER_03]: working, or they're just all working
together to like trick me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after a while, they realize it is
legitimate, and it is helping,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's all in the follow-up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And pharmacists, which only now in Canada
are getting involved, is the secret to it,
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're the ones that are more
following up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the ones monitoring the other
medication.
[SPEAKER_03]: The doctors can't be expected to do all
that, and I think that's a big help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think like the pharmacists are
actually like an interesting point,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you think about it in Germany,
we have had the prescription of
[SPEAKER_01]: dronabinol, which is pure THC for ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the pharmacists, I have the
impression that they feel comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: working with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctors feel more comfortable
prescribing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more like this barrier in the mind
for the flower products and for the
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts, but I think also that we owe a
lot of the progress that we have in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany to some very motivated pharmacists
who want to become experts who are working
[SPEAKER_01]: together with doctors to get these
prescriptions, or who are there to maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: do test-filling of cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at in Germany for the extract
product, there's only one extract
[SPEAKER_01]: available for inhalation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the other extracts are basically oral
solutions, but there are also pharmacists
[SPEAKER_01]: who are processing flour into extracts,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are possibilities through the
magisterial preparation, and I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: quite interesting to get the pharmacists
also involved, as well as the doctor,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you need both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any pharmacists in the room
here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any pharmacists here checking
out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Only a couple in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go talk to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm keen to hear from all of you,
actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do different countries approaches to
which conditions are eligible for medical
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: How does that impact access?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think most countries are probably
relatively conservative when they begin.
[SPEAKER_06]: And do restrict to a number of conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Epilepsy, pain tends to be in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So cancer, or going through chemo
treatment, and MS.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just feel, rightly or wrongly,
that it's based on what the perceived
[SPEAKER_06]: evidence is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel that there is so much more data
out there now that we need to just open
[SPEAKER_06]: our eyes, because it is there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting a huge amount of data being
gathered from real-world evidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we do know that governments need to be
conservative, particularly to begin with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if they restrict to a certain
number of conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have seen that that quickly
evolves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And take Australia, for example.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have now prescribed for over 200
different medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: It started off with just five.
[SPEAKER_06]: So within four years, it got to over 200
conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's got to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and I think that in Europe,
actually now, we have two types of
[SPEAKER_05]: countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like first, those who are preparing the
regulation by reviewing all existing data.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from last year, so clinical and
scientific data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they decided with the
pluridisciplinary committee of scientists
[SPEAKER_05]: to set few indications.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like France, for example, they set these
five indications for this pilot project.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know in Portugal, there are seven
indications.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have this simplified marketing
authorization submission.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also only for these specific
seven indications.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in parallel, we have these
countries like Germany and Poland with no
[SPEAKER_05]: limit of indication, only the knowledge or
conviction of a doctor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm back to example from Poland,
because I worked practicing this country
[SPEAKER_05]: for four years.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I remember I met a very, very young,
motivated medical doctor.
[SPEAKER_05]: His specialization, I think, was general
medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was doing the PhD in medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he started just discovering using
prescribing the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he told me that he had a group of six
or seven women with very severe pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Menstrual pain, period pains?
[SPEAKER_05]: Migraines, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, very severe migraines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the patients was so,
it was so difficult for her to manage this
[SPEAKER_05]: pain that she planned twice to commit
suicide.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she was really desperate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she started to have this prescription
of this purified extract for vaping,
[SPEAKER_05]: so 85% THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said, obviously, that it changed
her life.
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the scale of pain, on 10,
it still was like two.
[SPEAKER_05]: But she could function.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then he was motivated and said,
OK, I saw it's working.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I started to have a group of these
women between 40, 50 having these severe
[SPEAKER_05]: migraines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was convinced because he was just
close to this patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he even said, OK, I would like to
start observation study in my family.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hospital to maybe produce some scientific
data.
[SPEAKER_05]: So observation studies, by the way,
it's a very good tool to have to generate
[SPEAKER_05]: this real life data from patients under
controlled condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe not going directly to the full
clinical studies, which is obviously time
[SPEAKER_05]: consuming and money consuming.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, it's enough to have one or two
or a few doctors which are specialized in
[SPEAKER_05]: a specific domain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are very motivated, close to the
patient, with a lot of empathy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think we can generate a lot of
information from patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've both mentioned the French trial
quite a few times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think any of the data collection
from the French trials will be useful for
[SPEAKER_07]: other markets?
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I love that the French government
are collecting this data.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we really hope that they do something
with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would expect a report to be published
on the efficacy, or particularly the
[SPEAKER_06]: safety, sorry, in that particular trial.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we hope that they will.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they don't, then I know we as a
company supplying into that trial collect
[SPEAKER_06]: our own pharmacovigilance data.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to be really important as
we continue to build on that data
[SPEAKER_06]: gathering.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, let's hope that France come out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think that could be a turning
point for other countries as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would add also that here, a French pilot
project, it's not clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really the purpose was to have to
check kind of supply chain, how it can be
[SPEAKER_05]: controlled from manufacturer through the
distributor to the patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a trial, a lot of learnings.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think first, a report was published
already after two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as Flita, you said, something new
which is not existing in any other
[SPEAKER_05]: European country is pharmacovigilance.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's also like a kind of hybrid through
the hydraulics website, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: But every month, every company
participating in this trial are receiving
[SPEAKER_05]: the report of the complaints of the
patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes these are very light cases,
sometimes it's severe cases.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have statistics and we can see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the end, they would generate kind
of report.
[SPEAKER_05]: For information, lack of efficacy is also
a side effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can say.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what I was mentioning about
doctors who started to treat the pain with
[SPEAKER_05]: the high CBD product the first year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we lost a lot of patients because of
this lack of knowledge or maybe,
[SPEAKER_05]: yes, lack of experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then we practice, we could improve
this data in France.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure, and this is why it was also this
extension of one year for this pilot
[SPEAKER_05]: project, big deception for the patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that it will allow health
authorities, but also all the institutions
[SPEAKER_05]: who are implementing regulation to use
this data to maybe not only use,
[SPEAKER_05]: but digest and take some learnings to
implement the solid real, not only because
[SPEAKER_05]: this is what I was mentioning about
overregulation, like realistic regulation
[SPEAKER_05]: to help patients have a high quality
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the easy way, not too complicated
way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's been so great to hear,
and I'm sure everyone in the audience
[SPEAKER_08]: agrees, the detail from the different
markets and how much we actually do have
[SPEAKER_08]: to learn from what's happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not doing all this in a kind of
microcosm country by country.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's so much globally to learn.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a result of that, I'd love to kind of
open up to the audience and see if there
[SPEAKER_08]: are any burning questions, key thoughts
anyone wants to raise as we've got such an
[SPEAKER_08]: international panel of amazing women.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Alex as well, here with us today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Alex as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it for all these amazing women.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Alex as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: This man right here has a question right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Him first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming back to education, because I
know in Denmark, well, Fleta, you were
[SPEAKER_00]: saying in Australia, part of the success
has been the fact that doctors have been
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, maybe patients have been
educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in Europe, that's still a huge
problem because a lot of patients don't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually know that they have access to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of doctors, they're a bit scared of
prescribing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most Europeans in theory have access to
cannabis, but they don't in reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in Denmark, the Danish government
are also trying to implement events and
[SPEAKER_00]: conferences to kind of bring people like
yourselves, doctors, and patients together
[SPEAKER_00]: to sort of implement it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what can the rest of Europe do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Alex, you said you had to almost
take control yourself and create these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis clinics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how do you move that conversation
forward and try and get medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: out to the masses?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one thing that I think is really
important, and I didn't want to touch on
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier because I wanted to get to
questions, but I mean, since you brought
[SPEAKER_03]: it up, I think something that was really
important is for people to be honest with
[SPEAKER_03]: their doctors.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we had in Canada, just like
everywhere else, there was such a stigma
[SPEAKER_03]: where people who were using cannabis were
not telling their doctors they use
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis because they were worried what
they were going to think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we started teaching the
doctors, we said, you know, talk to your
[SPEAKER_03]: patients about it, be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were blown away that the
patients, once they felt more comfortable
[SPEAKER_03]: talking to their doctor, that their doctor
knew something about this, then they were
[SPEAKER_03]: opening up and the doctors would say,
holy cow, I didn't realize how many of my
[SPEAKER_03]: patients are using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I was started to be like,
hey, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not asking you because I want to kick
you out of my clinic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm asking you because I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden that all changed and
people were being honest with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they were like, oh, wait a
minute, more of my patients are using
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll talk to them about it because
the reality is cannabis is so readily
[SPEAKER_03]: available pretty much everywhere in the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like everywhere we go, people use
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think once doctors realize that,
that the patients are going to use
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, whether they like it or not,
and now they should have a harm reduction
[SPEAKER_03]: approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe we should talk to them about
maybe not smoking it or using CBD or not
[SPEAKER_03]: such high THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we can have real conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that is a big game changer
that I would like to share with people is
[SPEAKER_03]: be honest with your doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the doctor is hating on cannabis,
maybe you should find a different doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are open-minded doctors out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is such a patient-driven industry and
our doctors do learn from patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they don't accept it and are open
and willing to learn about prescribing
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis medicines, they potentially lose
patience and the patients move on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where you start to get these
clinics and other specialized doctors or
[SPEAKER_06]: authorized prescribers in the space
because they are willing and open.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are channels whereby patients
can access and know who to access just in
[SPEAKER_06]: terms of who prescribes more often than
not.
[SPEAKER_06]: So patients have got a huge voice.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it doesn't take away from the fact
cannabis producers, just like
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmaceutical companies, have got a role
to play.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need people on the ground
educating.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need to be continuing our webinars,
whether that's sending out faxes to doctor
[SPEAKER_06]: clinics, because believe it or not,
that's still happening, and as well as
[SPEAKER_06]: other strategies to bring doctors
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have one question up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: One question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very quickly, please, because we're
running out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've all talked a lot about
concentrates, but you haven't really
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned anything about pills or about
ingestibles, edibles, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any market for that in Europe
today?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if not yet in THC, what about CBD?
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, all the galling formats are
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: But obviously, we have to submit full
marketing authorization to the country
[SPEAKER_05]: which is ready to obtain such a
submission.
[SPEAKER_05]: So currently, it's Portugal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very ready from few years, I think three,
four years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very explicit and detailed regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But currently, nobody achieved to have
marketing authorization.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have only one approved flower in
Portugal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So still, I think there is the path.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is confirmed from Magistrate
Formulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is why the proactive, innovative
pharmacies, which I see they are sitting
[SPEAKER_05]: there, for example, having the big
Magistrate Formulation labs in their
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they have a knowledge of formulation,
if they have a prescription for the
[SPEAKER_05]: doctor, for example, for the tablets with
CBD or THC, they are able to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is also the financial aspect and
the reimbursement, for example,
[SPEAKER_05]: in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't think that the pharmacies
will spend their time in doing these
[SPEAKER_05]: tablets or any other edibles in the
pharmacy, in the Magistrate Formulation,
[SPEAKER_05]: only to help the patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this is more complex problem,
not only from formulation, from
[SPEAKER_05]: feasibility, because this is possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the doctor is prescribing the tablet,
for example, I don't know, 50 milligrams
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD, 50 milligrams THC, it can be
manufacturing by pharmacies in the
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmacy in Germany, also in Poland.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think there is the problem of the
time on the reimbursement also of the
[SPEAKER_05]: pricing of these products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there are some available.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are soft gel caps in the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, again, it's a patient-driven
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps it's what's the content and what
is inside the capsule that's probably the
[SPEAKER_06]: issue at the moment and not getting the
results.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the patients just don't seem to be
demanding that right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think as the medicinal regime
progresses and more doctors start
[SPEAKER_06]: prescribing, they will want these options.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they do need to go through
registration processes as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And earlier in the beginning of the talk,
we touched on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't talk too much because there's
not really any regulations for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But truthfully, these products are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see a lot of edibles, beverages,
extracts being used by medicine,
[SPEAKER_03]: reduces stigma, doesn't have the same
smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I want to point out about this
is that you're only letting the illicit
[SPEAKER_03]: market win by not having these products.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we had in Canada is every product
that wasn't legalized was what the illicit
[SPEAKER_03]: market was celebrating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the only negative we are left with
is a 10 milligram maximum per package,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is extremely wasteful and stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now the illicit market is pretty much
holding on to 100 milligram, 1,000
[SPEAKER_03]: milligram edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside of that, there's almost no reason
to go to the illicit market anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I predicted two years ago,
by 2025, we aren't even going to have an
[SPEAKER_03]: illicit market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what the future holds for
everyone else, which seems like a lifetime
[SPEAKER_03]: away for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hate to cut you off there, but we are
actually out of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more time for this fantastic panel.
