[SPEAKER_03]: Good afternoon everybody, my name is
Lorenza and I work for the European
[SPEAKER_03]: Industrial Hemp Association and I'm very
happy and I see that you are super excited
[SPEAKER_03]: to discuss about finers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will share the presentation with me
and my colleague Francesco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, so I'm CFO and supervisor,
I cover mostly bioeconomy applications of
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp and agricultural environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So super boring, I'm not boring because
I'm covering the upper part of the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: where we find the seeds and some
cannabinoids, the leaves and the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are a trade association,
we are sitting in Brussels, you can see
[SPEAKER_03]: our office is just beside European
Parliament, European Commission.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are doing advocacy and lobbying at
European Parliament.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said before, we are a small team,
I'm the managing director and with Monica,
[SPEAKER_03]: she's in the room as well, we take care of
the upper part of the plants while
[SPEAKER_03]: Francesco...
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, we mostly work on agricultural
environment and bioeconomy application
[SPEAKER_00]: with another colleague of mine,
so it's half and half.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we focus on both aspects of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, some numbers on our association.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we count nearly 240 regular members,
which means companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 32 associate members that are
individual that can join EIA to have
[SPEAKER_03]: access to the information.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are building hopefully a little bit
more some national association.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are doing that and then we have 12
membership plus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Membership plus tend to be a consultant or
tax advisor or lawyers that again,
[SPEAKER_03]: they can join us and participate in all
the activities that we are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our biggest target, I would say,
is trying to advocate to obtain a positive
[SPEAKER_03]: legislation around hemp and all its
derived products.
[SPEAKER_03]: From another side, we build as well some
network for allowing our member to create
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully some business opportunities as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We cover mostly Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we are active, for me,
a little bit too much at national level,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we are doing that because at national
level, unfortunately, all over 27 member
[SPEAKER_03]: state, we cannot count today on strong
national association.
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, we go beyond our mandate
sometimes and we are active at national
[SPEAKER_03]: level as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, when it comes to international
level, the seats is empty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the seat was empty.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we have recently founded the Federation
of International Hemp Organization where
[SPEAKER_03]: all the association coming from different
continent, we have Australia, New Zealand,
[SPEAKER_03]: China, US and Canada, we join forces to be
the voice of the sector within the
[SPEAKER_03]: international panel, meaning Codex
Alimentarius, FAO, and United Nations,
[SPEAKER_03]: where they do not lost so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have made quite good progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we are talking about, we are talking
about cannabis sativa and we should only
[SPEAKER_03]: speak about one species of cannabis,
which is the cannabis genus instead of
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping speaking about roderalis in the
case sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: We believe that there is only one genus of
cannabis and then we have different...
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists have believed so on us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to define industrial hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we usually use the THC level on
the field, which can be between 0 to 0.3%
[SPEAKER_00]: and 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the average values around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We distinguish industrial hemp from
medicinal or adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just maybe a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our members cannot reply.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is defining the THC level that is
allowed in hemp in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you believe it is the European Union or
its members?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we make this little survey?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you believe it is the European Union,
please raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Raise your hands now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the others believe that it is
national.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it is a bit more complex than
that because we always hear about this
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3%, 0.2% at European level, but that is
only the threshold for the purpose of
[SPEAKER_00]: giving direct payments to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you know that in Europe,
farmers receive money from the European
[SPEAKER_00]: Union to produce whatever crop they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, industrial hemp is below 0.2%
and then will be 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an established THC level for
these payments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many member states basically copy and
paste at that level and use it for the
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose of the legality of the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Finne, it is the member state that
decides what is the maximum level of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: in the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are countries, for example,
the Czech Republic that adopted 1%
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went up to 0.6%, so it's sort of a
margin when it comes to controls on the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, the 0.3% will be at least
0.3% from the 1st of January, 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an advocacy battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a battle, actually, because we had
many people against the increase of the
[SPEAKER_00]: THC level on the field from 0.2% to 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be 0.3% from next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it is the member state that
decides what is hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's reiterate, because it's so important
and so many people have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the 0.3% is linked to direct payment.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It means that if I am a farmer,
wherever I am in Europe, and I decide to
[SPEAKER_03]: plant up to 0.4%, if there are no other
regulation on national level that doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: allow me, it simply means that Brussels is
not sending me the money.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a farmer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I'm not allowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question that we have asked to
everybody, is the 0.3% illegal or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is illegal limits yes or no?
[SPEAKER_03]: The answer is no.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just linked to direct payment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, as Francesco explained,
each member state can do a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the time, they misuse these
limits that, again, it's only for direct
[SPEAKER_03]: payment.
[SPEAKER_03]: The case of Italy, up to 0.6%,
they adapt.
[SPEAKER_03]: The case of Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, this is more like our definition
of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is industrial hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should be industrial hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should be cannabis varieties that
are growing open field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using sustainable farming practices,
ideally.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, we're moving towards more
sustainable farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where the whole plant is used.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here, there's a seed
production and a hemp for fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whole plant approach is key for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it makes sense from a
sustainability point of view, from an
[SPEAKER_00]: economic point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we have to work a bit on the
varieties, on the farming practices to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that we can harvest both seeds
and fiber, or flowers and fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dual, a tribal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dual or tribal use as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if grown this way, it is a highly
sustainable crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all know the advantages of hemp for
the soil, for the air, for the bees,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for the bio-economies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a little bit clearer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you plant hemp into a greenhouse in
pots, this is not so sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We believe that industrial hemp cultivated
in this way, meaning double or triple use,
[SPEAKER_03]: it really becomes a sustainable plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a different sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we encourage those who plant
indoor to make sure that they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher sustainability when it comes to,
for example, energy consumption,
[SPEAKER_00]: which seems to be the only things you can
play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much energy you use in your
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, we cannot make the same
claim for indoor grown hemp, cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, as we can for outdoor grown
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we observing now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we stand when it comes to hemp
products marketed in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we experiencing a renaissance of hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we believe that we are moving from
zero to hero.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're maybe not there yet, but we'll get
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please do not underestimate the
potential of fiber and shifts application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because hemp is looked at by big
industrial companies working in
[SPEAKER_00]: construction sector, in the textile
sector, non-moving sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is the best resource for transition
towards greener economies, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the only fiber crop that we can grow
everywhere in Europe, from Finland to
[SPEAKER_00]: Sicily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is also a very high quality crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a great opportunity, not only for
the medical purpose that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing until now, at the conference,
but also for bioeconomy applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, for food application,
let's not forget seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the flowers for CBD
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we said, it's a high sustainable crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can also bring opportunities for
repatriating value chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe for those who come from the Americas
are not acquainted with the vocabulary
[SPEAKER_00]: that has been used by the European
institutions, but they've been speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more about getting back to the
value chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the trade war between China and US,
and then the Ukraine war, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw how fragile our value chains are at
global level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, like European institutions and
national institutions, are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: rebuild those value chains here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great opportunity for those
who want to invest in industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about food and feed as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Food and feed belongs to the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can harvest the seeds on top of the
fibers, as we have said before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why we are interested in the seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a good protein.
[SPEAKER_03]: It contains a good protein contents.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a plant-based alternative.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that there are many people that
are switching their diets towards a more
[SPEAKER_03]: plant-based diet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hemp could be, on top of all the
others, a good source of alternative for
[SPEAKER_03]: meat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a trend that is increasing
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have seen some figures during our
conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a booming sector that is still,
for me, untapped when it comes to hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the margin to grow are quite good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be sold as well as a food
supplement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, we are not throwing away
any parts of the plants, which makes one
[SPEAKER_03]: more time hemp a really sustainable crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk about seeds, the operators
have a small issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a small issue that we solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You solved that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also solved, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the operators are trading hemp
seeds, there is only one thing that they
[SPEAKER_03]: have to control, is the THC limits in the
seeds, meaning in the final product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So till the 1st of January 2023 in Europe,
there are no maximum level of THC in the
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, which made the operators become
crazy because there is different value,
[SPEAKER_03]: or there is no value.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because till today, we only had an EFSA
opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: By definition, an opinion is not a legally
binding.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, member states were looking so
closely to this opinion coming from EFSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the European Food Safety
Authority.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as I said, till now there was no
maximum level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the European Industrial Hemp
Association advocated for many years to
[SPEAKER_03]: finally convince the member state to adopt
a maximum level that is similar from
[SPEAKER_03]: Poland to Lisbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially it's mandatory,
meaning that all member states have to
[SPEAKER_03]: comply.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see in the slide, these are the
limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's explain a little bit the limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the member state gave us 3 mg per
kilogram for seeds and 7.5 for the oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: On top of that, they allowed us,
like any other protein or any other food,
[SPEAKER_03]: they allowed us to add an uncertainty
factor to make sure that the range is
[SPEAKER_03]: respected.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we count the maximum level,
we should make a simple calculation,
[SPEAKER_03]: the maximum level plus the uncertainty
factor, which brings us to the value that
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see on the right side of the
screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this value, let's take the 11 ppm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ppm is equal to mg per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the same value of Canada and US.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are quite happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have some limits that are lower
compared to Canada and US when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so far, we cannot increase them more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we do not have any studies that
show that we can go beyond the ARDF,
[SPEAKER_03]: which stands for acute reference dose,
for THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is why we are conducting,
but we will see that later, the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: trial on human beings on THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are some examples of products that
we can find today on the market that
[SPEAKER_03]: derive from seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you see, we do have products.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have this product.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find them in most of the
supermarkets in Europe and it's a growing
[SPEAKER_03]: sector, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to talk about the fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it comes to the flour and the
leaves, we would love to sell them as food
[SPEAKER_03]: supplement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Member states do not agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: European food safety authorities neither.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have an issue, as you can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we do not like, and this makes our
members very angry, and I have to admit
[SPEAKER_03]: that I agree with them, is that member
states are changing their mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1997, the European Industrial Health
Association had received, not one,
[SPEAKER_03]: two letters from the European Commission
saying, guys, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not novel food.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's traditional food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, our member invested the money
into processing line to market this
[SPEAKER_03]: product as food supplement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then comes 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a booming on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: The member states are getting nervous,
so they decided to change the so-called
[SPEAKER_03]: novel food culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, again, is not a legally binding
document by member states because there is
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing on hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tend to follow even a non-legally
binding document.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is a novel food, Lorenzo?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: They know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: A novel food is a food that has not been
consumed up to a significant decrease
[SPEAKER_03]: before 1997.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can discuss ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it mean significant?
[SPEAKER_03]: We will not agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So imagine if I do agree with member
states on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 2016, we experienced the first change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the products are novel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are still not novel food,
so the market is still surviving quite
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2019, I joined EIA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ten days after, we got the change on the
catalogue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is novel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leaves, flour, and extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, what does it mean novel?
[SPEAKER_03]: It means that you need a pre-market
authorization before marketing this
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, what does it mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very complex and very costly
process that allows you to obtain a paper
[SPEAKER_03]: that makes authorities feel more
comfortable when they see your product on
the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it happened in 2020.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that we never expect such a
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in 2020, for a moment that was
hopefully very brief, a couple of months,
[SPEAKER_03]: the European Commission and the member
state thought that hemp was a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they said that they were joking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the end of 2020, they changed their
mind and they confirmed that all parts of
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants can be considered a food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Novel, but still a food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what's going on afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our position, the position of our
member, the position of the association.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not agree with member states.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do believe that only isolate and
enrich cannabinoids should be considered
[SPEAKER_03]: as novel food, while low concentration,
or what we call the naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_03]: level of cannabinoids, should be traded,
like it was before 2016 and before,
[SPEAKER_03]: as a traditional food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we are doing, we have decided,
I don't know why, but we did it,
[SPEAKER_03]: to do the novel food application on the
behalf of our members.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have founded a consortium of
companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have collected 3.5 million of euros and
we have launched several novel food
[SPEAKER_03]: applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one for isolated CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one for synthetic CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one of our members care about synthetic
CBD, but you remember hemp was a narcotic,
[SPEAKER_03]: so only synthetic was a viable solution
for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have filled in even the application
for synthetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But where we care the most are the full
spectrum extract, which are the more
[SPEAKER_03]: complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they do contain THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for these three types of products,
we have conducted and we are still
[SPEAKER_03]: conducting novel food application on the
behalf of our member.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we stand, these are the talks that
we have been doing two big expenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nearly 2 million of euros were spent on
the toxicity of isolated and full
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all the studies that we have
been performing so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in parallel, as I said before,
because full spectrum contains THC,
[SPEAKER_03]: we decided to invest 1.6 million of euros
into the biggest trial for THC on human
[SPEAKER_03]: beings that will start in couple of weeks
in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see, we'll get results next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next year for both the THC, sorry,
the isolated CBD is over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we submit the application to EFSA very
shortly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The full spectrum is still ongoing,
will be done by the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trial on human beings will be 2023.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll discuss about flower seeds and
let's get back to the fibers and the
[SPEAKER_00]: sheaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: For just a quick reminder, it's a bit
different than harvesting flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are specific farming practices,
harvesting machines, and very importantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most important part of hemp processing
for fiber is the retting, which can be
[SPEAKER_00]: performed in many different ways according
to the geographical area where you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do de-retting or grain retting,
retting on the field where you have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: rain, enough water or humidity,
but you cannot do that, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you need other technologies like
ultrasound, microbial, enzyme retting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a controlled environment,
possibly in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course you get the bales and
you go to the processing site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are two different ways of
processing hemp fiber depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get the long fiber,
you can apply the same technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's a bit more complex than
this, but I will make it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to get the long fiber for
textile applications, basically like flax,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use the same scotching lines as
for flax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're pretty good at that in Europe
because we produce 85% of the flax volumes
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world, and we have all the
scotching facilities, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, if you want to work on
technical fibers or short fiber for
[SPEAKER_00]: cottonization, for making cotton-like
yarns, or for insulation material,
[SPEAKER_00]: paper grade fiber, you go through a
decortication facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those countries who do not have a
decortication facility might have a hard
[SPEAKER_00]: time, or a scotching line, a hard time
investing in the fiber market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So numbers, how many decortication we do
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, we have around between 10 and
15 decorticators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, they are assembled but not
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have, for example, we have two in
Germany, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two in the Netherlands,
five or six in France, and there are more
[SPEAKER_00]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I understand that there are some
Canadian and US decorticators coming up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where they stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The co-products, which is by-products,
rather, of the fiber production are
[SPEAKER_00]: shifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge market for shifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot even imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mulch, it's animal bedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animal bedding market explode in the past
years because everybody was getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, profits and stuff at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also very important, yes,
many companies are out of stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also it's material used in the
construction industry, and you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine how many construction companies,
some of them that are also in the stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: some stock markets in Europe, are getting
interested in hemp, in construction,
[SPEAKER_00]: and are already producing hemp-based
construction material lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't have to repeat myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially bioeconomy products are those
where the carbon storage potential of hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: is at its best.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have huge markets in perspective,
and just to give you, I will not repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: myself about the decortication of value
chains, but just to give you a few numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: of the huge markets I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the non-woven huge market, again,
it's medical applications, absorbent
[SPEAKER_00]: papers, hygiene products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nine billion euros turnover in 2019,
only in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking about natural fiber
overall for any type of application,
[SPEAKER_00]: globally we have 60 billion of market
synthetic fiber, 147 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And construction products, that is,
sorry, euros, not U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars, 800 billion worth market only in
Europe for construction products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if we had like 0.5% of those
markets, I would believe that would
[SPEAKER_00]: represent great opportunities for
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just some products in the different
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is textiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen for sure Patagonia,
COS, so H9 Group, Nike, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Construction product, construction
materials, I mean, they're quite good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have France, the UK, they're very much
advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice companies, also big ones
using hemp for installation, or for making
[SPEAKER_00]: hardwood, bricks, in-situ cast,
hemp cleat, prefab walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Romania as well, but maybe they have also
Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an Italian company also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conventional company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very good because they perform very
well in terms of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They store carbon on very long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have good permanent acoustic
performances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that we have composites and
plastics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not forget that you can also extract
cellulose from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the fiber to reinforce
biomaterials molded in any shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have granulates and filaments for
3D printing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you can do whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And either from the cellulose or from the
fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can mix the fiber with the resins,
as I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, maybe the question would be where
to invest, or rather how would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: economy of the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all countries, all geographical
areas have their own peculiarities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that it's interesting to see
what's going on in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not the U.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a complete different path,
different societies, different
[SPEAKER_00]: philosophies, different political
institutions, and different objectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some ways we also opposite,
for example, to the American culture in
[SPEAKER_00]: some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally believe, maybe we believe,
in Keza's area, that we have great
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities ahead for hemp, especially
in the bioeconomy, for the food market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's not forget about industrial hemp
and all its applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some take-home messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we said, invest on sustainability,
on outdoor hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invest in processing facilities for the
fiber extraction, because again,
[SPEAKER_00]: huge markets ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use old co-products, because there are
markets for all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But always aim at one application.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow hemp, you grow hemp for one
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you valorize the co-products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the time today, we have around 82
varieties in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen many new ones in the past four
or five months.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few, not eight as it was in
the paper, but okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be more coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a variety of research will develop
further, and we will achieve a full whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant approach, hopefully everywhere in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course you have to take into
account that you have to aim at something
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to CBD, Lorenz,
a few final words?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, CBD as food supplement, as I said
before, it will be tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is the product that we believe is
much more suitable for our market.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tox studies are coming, and science
seems to be with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today is not the venue to share
preliminary results.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something to be discussed with our
members.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it will support science will be with
us, and hopefully all the application will
[SPEAKER_03]: be submitted to EFSA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we will wait for the risk
assessment.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is one take-home message,
which is join AIR, join the association,
[SPEAKER_03]: participate in the working group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither me, neither Francesco,
we have no clue about the technicality or
[SPEAKER_03]: all the peculiarities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need your expertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in this way, the better informed
we are, the much more efficient we will be
[SPEAKER_03]: in front of the authorities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without you, without your support,
we don't go so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they pretend to have a salary,
both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have time for maybe one question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone have a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microphones coming soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more time for Francesco, good evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lorenz, our own answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot for your presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have two questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, what was the argument against 0.2%
versus 0.3?
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't my main question.
[SPEAKER_01]: With HEPA as a super food, is there an
opportunity for grain farmers to ship to
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa to backfill the loss of supply from
the Ukraine for wheat and other grains?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just wondering if there's an
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I taught a class in the University of
Nebraska on the economics of hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we talked about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the US isn't ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just wondering if the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take the second one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, can I?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will leave it to you to explain the
French situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it comes to protein, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an imbalance in this moment
because we cannot count anymore on
[SPEAKER_03]: Ukraine, at least for this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to rebalance again.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a lack of protein around the
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly hemp, with other
alternatives, could supply this gap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe is not ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 50,000 hectares.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you want me to go?
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot even feed half of Malawi.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Europe is not ready yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are we not doubling the hectares?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the regulation is locked.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is no real wish from the farmer
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the farmers, now the price,
are different after the Ukrainians.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are thinking, why should I invest
in plant hemp?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the police can come here and probably
throw away half of what I've been growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything is a little bit locked
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably there is an opportunity for US
or Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: But certainly we don't have enough to
export.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if I may, let's not make the
mistakes that we made in the past with
[SPEAKER_00]: countries around the world, basically
shipping everything and killing their
[SPEAKER_00]: value chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the objective is to empower those
countries and to make sure they have their
[SPEAKER_00]: value chains so they can produce their own
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that would be a very good
proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but in the short term?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in the short term we need trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we cannot rely on producing healthy
for feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will take a little bit longer at
the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the 0.2%, 0.3%, well,
there were... We should ask how many
[SPEAKER_03]: French people are there before applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point was that there were some
players that had a commercial interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping the 0.2% because they could sell
varieties at 0.2% and going up to 0.3% or
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially 1% means more space for new
varieties to be registered.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was terribly politically correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all so very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your unit.
Thank you.
