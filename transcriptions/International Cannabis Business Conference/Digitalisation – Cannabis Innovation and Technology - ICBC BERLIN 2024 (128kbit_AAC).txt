[SPEAKER_07]: Innovation and technology, which is that's
on everybody's mind right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to get into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to lead us in this panel, the founder
and managing director of Smells Like
[SPEAKER_07]: Business.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just on this podcast a few weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for Tom Pettit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all the rest of them come out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody come out right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, welcome to Innovation and
Technology in the Cannabis Space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ngayo, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ngayo, thank you for the wonderful
introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already had him on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also had a lovely conversation with
you again.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still not been published yet,
but it will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we'll start just with a brief
introduction from each of our panelists.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my name is Tom Pettit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the co-founder of Smells Like
Business.
[SPEAKER_03]: We run a marketing agency.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started out with the copyrighting
content creation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So over the last few years, obviously,
AI has had a little role in our company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think ChatGBT, for better or for
worse, is a part of our workflow these
[SPEAKER_03]: days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's how you integrate these different
technologies into your service to provide,
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously, the best outcome for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, that's me in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jürgen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Tom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my name is Jürgen Bickle from Stalls
& Bickle.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are producing the famous Volcano
vaporizer and the newest Venti vaporizer
[SPEAKER_02]: and other devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are located here in Germany in
Tuttlingen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are doing this now since 24 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have quite some experience in the
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am happy to be here at ICBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi there, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Tom.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Yogesh.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the CEO of Buffalo Extraction Systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: We help automate the processing and
extraction technologies for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the hemp space, other than this,
we come with experience in the herb,
[SPEAKER_05]: spice, and essential oil industries.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris Senakori, originally from New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for having me as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: 3WIN Corporation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a global vape distributor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Started in 2014.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've been very fortunate to be
coupled with C-cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick Tereberelli with the Paxium Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a manufacturer of automated
packaging systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have facilities in Canada, the US,
as well as Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for about the last eight years,
we've been manufacturing automated
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions for the cannabis industry with
about 300 installations globally.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously we have a few guests across
the value chain, which is really good from
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction to devices to post-harvesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: On that note, maybe we can start with
automation, because I think that's a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: big one in the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of innovation going on
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe, Nick, we could start with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how are you using automation in
Paxium?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping I was going to be the second
or the third question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being here in Europe, it's actually
been fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We received a very large order a couple of
weeks ago in the Netherlands for a large
[SPEAKER_00]: installation that we're going to be
installing in the next few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, it's been a learning experience,
understanding what's important here for
[SPEAKER_00]: the European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've installed several hundred systems
throughout Canada and the US over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: eight years, predominantly starting in
whey filling, pouch filling, jar filling,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as pre-roll automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, everything begins with a
project or an application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically we're following the lead of
our client base and understanding what
[SPEAKER_00]: their needs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much product do they need to produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: What formats?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nuances of child safety and their
marketing, per se.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you noticed, because you said you
just started working with some clients
[SPEAKER_03]: here in Europe, some of the trends,
especially when it comes to automation in
[SPEAKER_03]: the US and also Canada, have you noticed
some of that also over in Europe?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think there are different
problems that you need to address?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we are far more similar than we
are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, the delivery process of the
product, whether it's a pre-roll,
[SPEAKER_00]: a pouch or a jar, is incredibly similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there was a lot of booths here at
the show selling packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's essentially the same,
which makes it, I think, the transition
[SPEAKER_00]: much easier for an automation company like
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, really when you're
starting with the client, everyone has the
[SPEAKER_00]: same concern and the same needs in
automation in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reduction of giveaway, accuracy is of the
highest importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you maintain your margin?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you keep your margin, not give away
your margin?
[SPEAKER_00]: But moving into, you know, the actual
styles of packaging, very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, again, with a focus of
serialization and child safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, Jorg, I should maybe onto you,
because I know, I mean, extraction has
[SPEAKER_03]: moved, you know, leaps and bounds in
recent years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, we could probably
have a whole panel discussion just on
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction alone, but still sticking to
automation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how have you managed to integrate
automation into your extraction system?
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we look at automation in general,
let's take a step back here and see if you
[SPEAKER_05]: could divide it into automation
technologies for the extraction and
[SPEAKER_05]: processing space.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is from seed to sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: When, say, you cultivate a product,
you're growing, you have the traceability
[SPEAKER_05]: of the seed and the genetics, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: From there on to pick and pack solutions
for using robots to separate out the
[SPEAKER_05]: flower that goes into say, convection
heating or cold heating, and then gets
[SPEAKER_05]: milled into the product based on the
client requirement, or goes into
[SPEAKER_05]: extraction per se, and then the use of new
technologies like butane that come around
[SPEAKER_05]: the block, and old technologies that like
CO2 extraction that have been around in
[SPEAKER_05]: the other herb and spice space that are
being utilized in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been used, we've been tying up,
there's a lot of use of machine learning
[SPEAKER_05]: and artificial intelligence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where there has been use of SCADA systems
and recipe management systems that not
[SPEAKER_05]: only improve patient safety, better
traceability, and also reduce the waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's essential for waste management
where all of this data is being logged,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can reduce the waste of particular
harvest and then reuse them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that's a whole new industry of
what's coming out of the recreational,
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal, and the nutraceutical space in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So throughout the whole space,
and then in the end, as Nick mentioned,
[SPEAKER_05]: is use of robots, so robots technology for
packaging solutions, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: So automation is not just being used from
on the extraction space, but the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: value chain has been using automation in
different phases.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the data is essential there to be used
using blockchain or AI so that the data is
[SPEAKER_05]: uninterrupted, not maintained across the
board, and increases safety and better
[SPEAKER_05]: waste management.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, wow, in a nutshell there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to jump in also on automation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know where the vape industry has come
from back in 2000, 2014, where everything
[SPEAKER_06]: was manually made.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now automation is now a standard for
C-cell, and now we're in Indonesia with
[SPEAKER_06]: 100% automation, and it's really been
incredible to see the lack of failures.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting to the point where the cartridge
is so dialed in for the end user,
[SPEAKER_06]: the lack of failures and the reliability
has really come tenfold.
[SPEAKER_06]: From where it was ten years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, streamlined the whole process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jürgen, I don't know if you have anything
to add on that front.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our case, automation is mainly
happening, of course, in our production
[SPEAKER_02]: facility, and of course with several steps
like welding, soldering, fully
[SPEAKER_02]: automatized, stock system is fully
automatized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course you rely on a lot of
automatized processes to be able to really
[SPEAKER_02]: have a high quality output.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all right, let's stick with you,
Jürgen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that, and also Chris especially,
you're leveraging a lot of technology and
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to enhance the cannabis user
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just wondering how do you
actually leverage technology and actually
[SPEAKER_03]: integrate it into a device without,
I guess, mitigating or without upsetting
[SPEAKER_03]: the sort of end user experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, on the one hand, of course,
the consumer nowadays is expecting really
[SPEAKER_02]: a high technology device, and he wants
also to customize the device, and at the
[SPEAKER_02]: same time he wants to have a simple use of
the device.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many times you have device where you
have, like in our case, the craft,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a one button device, and just the
user uses one button, heats up,
[SPEAKER_02]: and when he gets green, he can inhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, you need to have
more personalization and this we are
[SPEAKER_02]: realizing via an app where you can
personalize your experience, depending on
[SPEAKER_02]: the device.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like with the Volcano, you can even make
your own workflows, a certain temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: for a certain time, and then you go up
with the temperature, and many people
[SPEAKER_02]: experience with their terpene profiles and
doing things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the web app also allows you to get a
statistic about your usage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also access a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today we have, for example,
for the Venti, we have released our first
[SPEAKER_02]: time an over the air update.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you can use, we have never done this
so far before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So over the air update is also interesting
technology where you have to be a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit careful that everything works out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you roll it out for 10,000 of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have done it the first time,
and of course then you can also add on
[SPEAKER_02]: technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this regard, so this on the consumer
side, on the usability side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: devices, and of course on the construction
of the devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also if you look here to the Venti
technology, you see there's a flow meter
[SPEAKER_02]: array, sophisticated flow meter built in,
where we can really adjust the temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: control to the draw strength of the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this gives then a really extremely
equal vaporization, because extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: equal temperature and this leads then to a
very good taste, to a very good consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say today, technology is all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in your production, it's in your
device, it's in the device of the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's obviously complicated,
because of course you have to have it,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say under control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because with every device, it's getting
more complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's extremely important at the same
time, there are so sophisticated tools you
[SPEAKER_02]: can use today, so it's really great to be
able to offer this technology to the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll come to you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_03]: Technology is great, full stop,
when it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it doesn't, obviously it's a bit of a
different story, and it does add levels of
[SPEAKER_03]: complexity.
[SPEAKER_03]: But obviously you're trying to make it as
simple as possible for the end user.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was actually a great segue,
because for us it's about building brands.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you're building a brand,
like everyone in this room, when you're
[SPEAKER_06]: building your brand and you have your oil
and you've spent years perfecting your
[SPEAKER_06]: oil, the number one thing you want to do
is you want to put it in a quality device
[SPEAKER_06]: that's going to deliver for your patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not only have the best experience,
but be the safest as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that we at 3WIN and CSEL,
we've spent many years with our technology
[SPEAKER_06]: and just driving to have the perfect
vaporizer for your oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a research lab in Scottsdale,
Arizona, and we actually spend even more
[SPEAKER_06]: time on that, really dialing in your oil
to the perfect vaping experience,
[SPEAKER_06]: making sure that the resistance and the
ohms and every part of the device is
[SPEAKER_06]: dialed into your oil, because everyone's
oil is so different, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone has the best oil, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But to dial it into what is best about
your oil is what we strive for,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we've been extremely successful at
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I think that the CuraLeafs
and the TrueLeafs and the Crescos and the
[SPEAKER_06]: largest brands in the world are all CSEL,
because we feel like they know,
[SPEAKER_06]: wow, if we're going to put our name on a
device and we're going to sell this device
[SPEAKER_06]: worldwide, we have to have that
reliability and the trust factor in that
[SPEAKER_06]: device, because we're launching it to
millions of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I mean, how does it,
because I can imagine, to make sure that
[SPEAKER_03]: you provide that good service and you're
not ruining anyone else's brand... Eye
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pressure, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's technology, a lot of R&D must go
into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how does that whole process look
like?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much time and effort do you put into
something before you release it out and
[SPEAKER_03]: feel that you can trust it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can speak for CSEL, and it's years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Years.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we have our calendar, when we were
back in 2016, 2017, we're all doing our
[SPEAKER_06]: things through 2025 at the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like a 10 year schedule of how we
feel like the vaping industry is going
[SPEAKER_06]: year after year, and what's the new
innovation?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_06]: And for oil, I think about we went from
distillate to liquid live resin to rosin
[SPEAKER_06]: to liquid diamonds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are all different oils with
different consistencies and that we have
[SPEAKER_06]: to build a device that really is perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Within quite a short timeline.
[SPEAKER_06]: Within quite a short timeline,
as the industry is changing incredibly.
[SPEAKER_06]: From country to country, from state to
state with different regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, to say the least.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Nick, with Paxim, I know you're
working across multiple different
[SPEAKER_03]: verticals and how do you know what will
work for the cannabis industry and what
[SPEAKER_03]: new technology have you been able to
integrate to speed up your process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what's most important when you
start any application or any project with
[SPEAKER_00]: a processor is sometimes less is more and
sometimes more is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to understand their needs,
their production, and the outlook of their
[SPEAKER_00]: future business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming back to innovation, things that
we're working on, like you had just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, it's constantly evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to read, you need to do research,
you need to hedge, and you need to at
[SPEAKER_00]: times take chances and try to lead the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've always taken that approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we continue to lead and invest in R&D,
our competition should always be trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: chase us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, a lot of our investment has
been in inspection, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the, I think the most interesting
thing about pre-rolls is I've never met
[SPEAKER_00]: two people that could agree on what a good
joint is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's universal anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're starting to develop a lot of 3D
camera systems that will inspect
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-rolls at as much as 3,000 pre-rolls an
hour that can either be hand-fed or
[SPEAKER_00]: completely automated with a pre-roll
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're focused on traceability,
a lot of printing on bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible how much time and
resources are spent putting labels on your
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of our investment is real-time
printing, direct connection to your ERP,
[SPEAKER_00]: QR printing as well, traceability,
and then inspection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we see the future being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the packaging side, sure,
automation, weighing, filling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, again, coming back to
sometimes less is more and sometimes more
[SPEAKER_00]: is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, the way we look at our
relationships is that most of these
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships last longer than most
marriages, so you have to choose well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose your partner really well,
because you're together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to start with a basis of
trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to oversell your solution,
and then you also want to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: partner with a customer with the resources
and the investment in human capital,
[SPEAKER_00]: training, turnover mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a whole encapsulation of just many
different things, but ultimately it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down to a partnership and choosing that
partner well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nick and Chris, on the timing thing,
it takes a lot of time and effort,
[SPEAKER_05]: but how I see technology and automation,
there's always more upside than any
[SPEAKER_05]: downside to trying technology over years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a company, we've seen that in our
systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: For instance, a CO2 system where 15 years
of feedback loop has gone into it to
[SPEAKER_05]: perfect it the way it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we keep investing it further with
hopes of saying, hey, there's an upside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cannabis industry of jumping on
it, saying, as it matures, can we be part
[SPEAKER_05]: of the force of the maturing industry and
develop new technologies that are helping
[SPEAKER_05]: the market grow?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's a lot of timing,
effort, and partnerships that goes into
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Important partnerships.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a key takeaway there as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I think if you touched on
data, and data is super important in this
[SPEAKER_03]: day and age, you can extrapolate so much
data.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like it can almost be
overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do you then use that data in the
right manner?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you guys actually take your data,
extrapolate it, and actually integrate it
[SPEAKER_03]: then into your company in a productive
manner?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like you have an answer,
Yogesh.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first thing about data, there is so
much out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is no end to slicing data
further and trying to build inferences
[SPEAKER_05]: which may make sense to your business or
your product or may not at all make sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially with the advent of the
buzzwords as we speak in every industry
[SPEAKER_05]: now, artificial intelligence, machine
learning.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to know their true nature and what
data is useful and what's not is very
[SPEAKER_05]: important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because many a times we've had consultants
where you look at data in ways where there
[SPEAKER_05]: is no positive impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just an infinite loop of analyzing
and coming to no end.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the key is to look at the data
that's relevant and then use the existing
[SPEAKER_05]: technologies for traceability and for
safety and get those automation points in
[SPEAKER_05]: place.
[SPEAKER_05]: How it applies to extraction processing is
we've had sensor data from time,
[SPEAKER_05]: pressure, and recipes that are fed into an
automatic system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's been most useful in my case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if anyone has anything else
to add there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just add that it's really
understanding what your client needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's too much data and you
don't need any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, at the end of the day,
you're running a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one, you want to be in compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say, one, you want to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, you want to be in compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to work with your
clients and understand and also coach
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you can just be completely
inundated with just too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes back to less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes more is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other companies, they may run
their business very analytically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then others may have a different
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's just purely understanding
your client base and being able to offer
[SPEAKER_00]: choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then be able to take their direction
and lead them down that path with always
[SPEAKER_00]: the understanding of not overselling a
capability that you don't need,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that doesn't harness a long-term
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to maybe zoom out a little bit,
and especially Europe, we are a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: behind what's going on in the US in the
cannabis industry, also in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: space.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if there are any
technological trends that's happening that
[SPEAKER_03]: happened over there that you can see
working really well over here in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just off the... Well, if I look at
Canada, or starting in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're Canadian-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a nice head start about eight
years ago when they had legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the biggest trend that we see is
price compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost per kilo was significantly
higher, same in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's forced companies to have to be
really efficient, that they can't throw
[SPEAKER_00]: hand labor at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The margins aren't there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember early on in my career,
it would be, overfill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to 1.2 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone will be happy on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those days are over.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give away 20% of your product,
every package, you go out of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've seen is that's changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And companies have to be really aware that
overnight, the price of this commodity can
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuate tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't wanna be in a liquidity
crisis because your overhead is just so
[SPEAKER_00]: high and you have so much human labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've seen is companies are much
more nimble and they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: repurpose their valuable employees in more
meaningful roles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen that as being almost the
biggest trend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we're definitely, from the vape
aspect as well, you're 100% correct,
[SPEAKER_06]: the margins have shrunk so much over the
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So getting into a new market like we're in
right now, it's really going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting to see how that is diverted.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that in the US especially,
it's not so much the race to the bottom
[SPEAKER_06]: because you hate to always say that it's
the race to a amazing device that you can
[SPEAKER_06]: rely on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if people can focus on that,
I have to hedge that I'm in a great device
[SPEAKER_06]: in order to carry my business forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: So although the margins are shrinking
everywhere around us, I have the
[SPEAKER_06]: reliability of a consistent vaping
experience for my patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Insistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say maybe a difference also here
in Europe, I would say, is that compliance
[SPEAKER_02]: is even more important here in Europe than
in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the US it's not so much full of people
are like, or companies are always
[SPEAKER_02]: responsible for themselves and there isn't
so much from the state side, a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation only when it comes to
liability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is you only wanna protect your
liability but not much further.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in Europe, of course, compliance on
the device side especially is much more
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have any kind of norms you
need to follow, you need to have
[SPEAKER_02]: approvals, you need to have third party
approvals.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something what you need here in
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course in our case, we are still
the only one who's producing medical
[SPEAKER_02]: devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one point I wanted to touch,
it's important, we have here now a new
[SPEAKER_02]: legal system.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great and we have still the medical
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a concentrate at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will see if it comes over time,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the moment we are relying on dry
flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also on the medical side, we are relying
on dry flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dry flour you purchase in the
pharmacy at the moment, you cannot do
[SPEAKER_02]: anything with it as a patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to transform it into the roller
joint or you need to make a cookie or you
[SPEAKER_02]: can use a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the only validated method
available?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is very important to have
these kinds of compliance, these kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: approvals and certifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it is not a medical device,
you can also go to URL 8139, a great norm
[SPEAKER_02]: for vaporizers where you can certify your
devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it is important here in Europe
that you show your customers that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: some kind of third party approval what
shows the safety of your device.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course like you said, it is
medically approved as well, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course at the end you need a lot of
technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have technology to be able to really
have a medical device.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need it for your traceability,
for your whole production system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need it for your clinical data.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need it to show that you have really a
clinical benefit, that you have a positive
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit to risk ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need it for your post market
surveillance to get your consumer data
[SPEAKER_02]: back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So other clients, are they satisfied?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they understand everything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they understand cleaning protocols?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they understand how to use it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your manuals and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So also here in all levels you need
technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Technology is king.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean you touched on it and actually it
is a really nice segue to compliance and
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations because obviously we work in a
very highly regulated industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: for better or for worse, I think for
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously that comes with its own set
of challenges and I was wondering if,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think this can actually apply to all
of you, how do you actually address these
[SPEAKER_03]: different regulations in different states
or countries and are you using any digital
[SPEAKER_03]: tools in order to help mitigate and
control, understand that basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for us to work in Europe and we are an
American company, to work in Europe there
[SPEAKER_05]: are strict norms around EUGMP,
good manufacturing practices and that
[SPEAKER_05]: just, and for FLOWA it follows the WHO
GACP guidelines and it's electronically
[SPEAKER_05]: available.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of tracking that can be done
on the user requirement specification
[SPEAKER_05]: documents now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of automation has come in role
for your qualification of your equipment,
[SPEAKER_05]: for acceptance of your equipment,
the coordination with the auditors when
[SPEAKER_05]: they come in to comply a facility if they
are say making pharmaceutical products.
[SPEAKER_05]: So very stringent norms but I think they
are great because if a facility goes
[SPEAKER_05]: through it and especially the kind of
equipment, high pressure equipment that
[SPEAKER_05]: they are dealing with, if you don't do
that you could be essentially dealing with
[SPEAKER_05]: a high pressure bomb there which could
blow up if you don't have the right
[SPEAKER_05]: compliances in place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been great.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we leverage technology now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything can be done electronically as
opposed to old days where you need
[SPEAKER_05]: physical pieces of paper to do that and
traceability has become much easier with
[SPEAKER_05]: the advent of technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been implemented and you cannot
enter the pharmaceutical or the API space
[SPEAKER_05]: without doing EUGMP for us as a equipment
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like George mentioned, that is the key.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously you have to be certified and the
health of our patients is something that
[SPEAKER_06]: we all have to be cognizant of at all
times.
[SPEAKER_06]: To have the healthiest device with the
least amount of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the US, Michigan is the top standard so
across the board in the US we just go by
[SPEAKER_06]: the toughest standard possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nick, I don't know if you have anything to
add there.
[SPEAKER_00]: From our perspective, it's really
important to research every new country or
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say in the US state but every new
country that you work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, we have a manufacturing
facility in Italy, in Scio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have manufacturing in Montreal as well
as in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in Europe, we very much lean on
our Italian engineering force who are very
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced in EUGMP CE in these standards
and no different for when we work with our
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian clients in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we all live in a Google world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is online but you can plead
ignorance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to take compliance seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, working with your client
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different customers have different
expectations, different user requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need the infrastructure,
the engineering know-how to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: remain in compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So especially in this industry,
pharmaceutical, nutraceutical to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: extent, it's the cost of doing business.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to add to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially with the cannabis industry
being in a unique spot because we are
[SPEAKER_05]: constantly intersecting with the food and
beverage industry, with the pharma space,
[SPEAKER_05]: with the nutraceutical space, the topical
space and the recreational space.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these norms are in place already but as
the industry grows because of the taboo
[SPEAKER_05]: that cannabis held before it became legal,
the norms have existed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just about us picking them up in each
of our own companies and being responsible
[SPEAKER_05]: enough to follow those norms.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no advent of new norms here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that we pick up the right ones
when we enter a new country.
[SPEAKER_05]: And GMP authorities for the pharmaceutical
space have been kind enough that you would
[SPEAKER_05]: have a different version of that in South
Africa versus Europe, versus say Morocco
[SPEAKER_05]: or the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, they're all
saying the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe to add to this, I think it's
important that also the cannabis sector is
[SPEAKER_02]: really compliant with the normal rules
they are available and does not go a
[SPEAKER_02]: direction to say, okay, because it's
cannabis, we can make a workaround or we
[SPEAKER_02]: can be less compliant or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is the wrong approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many times it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens even to regulators that they're
saying, oh, it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use this device or you could use
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even the regulator itself approaches
it differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like you see in Australia in a
moment with the vape ban, they say,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, we do some medical devices with a
two-page approval there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that's not correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: We must comply as any other industry also
complies because only with this approach
[SPEAKER_02]: you will get the acceptance we need for
our future positive development and more
[SPEAKER_02]: ease of access for the consumers and
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would actually even like to add
something also when it comes to marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be super careful what you do
and don't say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very easy to get red flagged.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in this day and age of cancel
culture, if you do one wrong thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can get into a lot of trouble just by
writing the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we use different digital tools to
ensure which territory, what you can and
[SPEAKER_03]: cannot say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's also very, very
important because you talk about the
[SPEAKER_03]: software, the hardware.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even when it comes to branding,
you have to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't say something or do something
wrong there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we only have a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was thinking maybe we could,
if anyone has any questions from the
[SPEAKER_03]: floor, now would be a good time.
Come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: One question, just a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Nima Vesa and I wanted to ask
Chris a little more about the point about
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan as a standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could we talk, a lot of these
conversations are about top-down
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the opportunities for a bottom-up
approach for some of these kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: successful sub-markets to teach and inform
regulators at a national or international
[SPEAKER_01]: level to help us move forward together?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we're doing our innovation,
when we're doing our technology and making
[SPEAKER_06]: vape devices, everything being food grade,
medical grade, we just go by the top
[SPEAKER_06]: standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as far as the standards changing in the
future, I would assume that they're going
[SPEAKER_06]: off to the top standard to be more
compliant.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the levels are so low that it's almost
impossible to get too much lower than
[SPEAKER_06]: where they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as the bottom-up approach,
I'm not quite understanding what you're
[SPEAKER_06]: asking as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean is if the best example of a
regulatory standard comes from a locality
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to at a federal level,
could the federal or international
[SPEAKER_01]: standards learn from, disclosure,
I'm from Michigan, could learn from that
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess we can hope that the federal
regulation, which will come, I think it's
[SPEAKER_06]: just a matter of time before the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: becomes federally legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's on its way as we now have 40
of the 50 states and recreation moving
[SPEAKER_06]: forward and just about every election
there's new states that come on board.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's when federal regulation comes in,
I think they're going to have to go with
[SPEAKER_06]: the higher standard of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are we doing for time?
[SPEAKER_07]: You have five minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or maybe some favorite dance songs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a big buzzword is AI.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have to address the elephant in
the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Yogesh, I know that you sort of
touched on it and I was curious if Buffalo
[SPEAKER_03]: Extractions, if you guys have integrated
AI at all into your workflow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've got the data as part of our SCADA
systems and recipe management systems,
[SPEAKER_05]: as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for instance, if there's a particular
cultivar or strain, that's been used at
[SPEAKER_05]: the seed level, that could be traced back
to the final product and the data could be
[SPEAKER_05]: used, artificial intelligence could be
used essentially here to fine tune the
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivar further when it's going into
genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's crossing its ways with genetic
engineering there.
[SPEAKER_05]: How is that data useful for the genetics
of that particular cultivar, for waste
[SPEAKER_05]: management, as I mentioned, and also if
you can increase the efficacy of the
[SPEAKER_05]: product, using that data.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is in the extraction space.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure about the post-processing or
the packaging, for instance.
[SPEAKER_05]: In robotics there is it also intersects
with a lot of the robotics is in how can
[SPEAKER_05]: we say pick and play solutions and how can
we make them faster?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we make them more efficient?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the key words in the cannabis
industry are efficacy, efficiency and
[SPEAKER_05]: safety where AI can be leveraged
essentially at every part of the value
[SPEAKER_05]: chain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say AI in general what we
talked about data and what you get out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course we are trying to get the user
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course if people sending the device
back, if there's something happening or if
[SPEAKER_02]: we can get access through the app and then
we really know how the person is using it,
[SPEAKER_02]: how much is drawing it and we can analyze
this data, help with AI and then trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: really to see also on the original level
of course we sold over one million devices
[SPEAKER_02]: in more than 100 countries in the last
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course we have a global presence.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can really say it's a global presence
and of course on the one side cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere the same on the globe and the
most humans are the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really very interesting how
people are using it and what can you get
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the data, what you may not seen by
yourself, where you need maybe an AI and
[SPEAKER_02]: what you need, okay, and what you can then
include in your future devices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys have anything to
add if you're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Nick you just did a course right
on AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean on the machinery side a lot of our
investment now is machines that,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course self-learning optimization but
being able to communicate with you about
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative maintenance, wear and tear on
parts when you would require to replace
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then yeah, I was mentioning earlier
that we received our license of Microsoft
[SPEAKER_00]: Copilot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whoever hasn't used it yet,
it's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's just go to lunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because lunch is very short today and so
we'll take an extra couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it once again for our panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be back here at 1 p.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: or $1,300 depending on how you do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you got like 43 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eat fast, which is impossible.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Europe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take your time, but be back at one o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we'll see you soon.
