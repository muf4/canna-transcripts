[SPEAKER_01]: The long game Well, it should be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I'm Nick easily I'm CEO 3c
consulting I just made it back from
[SPEAKER_01]: America or from South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a lawyer I'm not a CPA a lot of
those past people great titles use these
[SPEAKER_01]: professionals without them You're screwed
most of the things we've seen in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: ten years were problems from legal
structuring not understanding the laws or
[SPEAKER_01]: like horrible tax burdens We're gonna make
a shit ton of money, but then you had
[SPEAKER_01]: horrible accounting in one company and the
investors wouldn't come in correctly so
[SPEAKER_01]: Use these professionals and just business
guidance here Originally from Wisconsin
[SPEAKER_01]: did military After military went to
Colorado right time right place 2006 right
[SPEAKER_01]: when it was like medical cannabis cards on
the wall to Hey, we're doing compliant
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I came in and have seen
this evolution happen Have worked all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the place in terms of states and countries
a lot of similarities market to market but
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the things that I see in least for
where this markets going may be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: different than most people because I've
been inside so many of the companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just reading online articles or
it's meeting with prime ministers seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: delegational work going into a company
when they've got 250 people and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not let's say making payroll and super
inefficient or didn't plan their business
[SPEAKER_01]: operations or Four fungal diseases nine
past destroying a huge multi-million
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar company that when you see those
parts of the company That's where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see What are the common trends?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is this really going and it's not
small-scale little warehouses like
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado back in the day Seeing this now I
think international cannabis business this
[SPEAKER_01]: one has been amazing from a conference and
for years and years seeing Now like what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happened in this last four to five years
since they started Everyone thinks about
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada or Uruguay for legalizing adult use
like definitely not legal internationally
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point with laws and policies But
with 19 countries having some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: import export or production business It's
really going to be amazing, but it sucks
[SPEAKER_01]: so much right now Because you have to hold
these positions in these countries that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have massive demand don't have
doctors making prescriptions It's not the
[SPEAKER_01]: same the German cannabis market as the
American cannabis market thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: legalized medical where you're thinking
prescriptions and doctors and then Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: having novel foods and how those
Regulations are going to affect a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: business there compared to we're going to
sell vape cartridges in Austria Probably
[SPEAKER_01]: probably not the same basis so everything
international other than Canada Uruguay
[SPEAKER_01]: Think API active pharmaceutical ingredient
markets bulk flour, and if it's flour It's
[SPEAKER_01]: not trimmed fancy like in a bag like this
is dank as shit weed It's usually ground
[SPEAKER_01]: up and unidentifiable so your whole
processes if you're a Canadian for example
[SPEAKER_01]: And then went to grow in Israel or in
Denmark all of a sudden you're growing one
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of specification of a product That's
not meant for the whole market and your
[SPEAKER_01]: whole business plan was wrong So country
by country how they relate whose
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical compacts work together how
they You know the WHO's recommendations
[SPEAKER_01]: this March could be like step two of the
step three end game for cannabis But it's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening, but a lot of countries talk
about this there are opportunities
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere But if their laws are not
correct you're going to completely fail
[SPEAKER_01]: like a Zimbabwe a la su to a Swaziland if
it's not correct modeled on these laws You
[SPEAKER_01]: really have to be very careful in
navigating which ones are coming up here
[SPEAKER_01]: because some are just gonna like waste
your time and be painful Most of these
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses Compliance is unique here in
Canada or here in California in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: but each place is different So if you're
thinking of a hands-on company,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're investing in them or operating
them like what rules do you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: follow?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do these rules change?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you have enough capital to do this
and most people they get this license?
[SPEAKER_01]: They see huge value which that's massive
opportunities with these limited licenses
[SPEAKER_01]: in states and countries But they don't
realize that that piece of paper is the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing that matters So how do we not
lose this piece of paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just how do we make a consumer package
female wellness hemp lifestyle brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: for example It's that aspect what's really
important to build everything off of but
[SPEAKER_01]: most people don't know how to cover their
ass in the space or think What is the
[SPEAKER_01]: value in your opportunity?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the piece of paper When we think you
know I put ATF on here like alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco firearms They get to have all the
fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it goes that way But when you think
of what we're doing and why certain
[SPEAKER_01]: companies have come in on an investment
opportunity It's just barely begun but now
[SPEAKER_01]: is the bleeding like when we're almost at
20 billion dollars as an industry annually
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the hands-on opportunities
what what's really gonna gonna play out
[SPEAKER_01]: here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And who's gonna control it from a US basis
as well as an international basis so some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these opportunities We're not gonna we
don't grow tobacco in every single state
[SPEAKER_01]: and have like there's a different tax Like
state by state or why doesn't our good
[SPEAKER_01]: beer out of Colorado make it to all these
other markets?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because there's these different Taxes
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we're going towards federal side,
it's a when Yeah, think how are you gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: play into that with these opportunities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just I have a cool dispensary in
Berkeley or I have a delivery company in
[SPEAKER_01]: San Luis Obispo or I have 10,000 Eric
acres of flowering canopy or something
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere So to beat the odds here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's tens of thousands of us now as
companies businesses individuals and Most
[SPEAKER_01]: people don't realize how their little
operation is gonna Weather this next storm
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're already ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as fun as it used to be but it's
way more fun on different levels This is
[SPEAKER_01]: what changes things for the hands-on
companies be it any sort if they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: integrate with their communities correctly
They have the biggest problems from a tax
[SPEAKER_01]: rate standpoint From you know being
bothered or not choosing the right
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities So choose a good place be
involved with that community and don't be
[SPEAKER_01]: an asshole in that community very very
important like the good neighbor policies
[SPEAKER_01]: and in California with your Compassionate
care at prop D prop M 215 temp state state
[SPEAKER_01]: license process or or any other
jurisdiction If you didn't have that
[SPEAKER_01]: community piece along the way,
those are the ones that fail The people
[SPEAKER_01]: are crazy huge I've realized it's now more
than ever over a decade that each
[SPEAKER_01]: company's operation as you're building
these teams or when we look at investment
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities where If it's a team in
another country or another state like that
[SPEAKER_01]: had to bring in expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did they do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are they doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I see way too many good businesses
Just fail without good people and it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: just getting some advisors But you need
your local people and really understand
[SPEAKER_01]: the operation there's so many outside
industries that are applicable to this
[SPEAKER_01]: space and The people and their skill sets
but you have a very limited window where
[SPEAKER_01]: you can take applicable and make it
awesome in this space Otherwise,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just crush it because it's not
something else, but it's very similar But
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, the biggest things that I see
important for people it's what they bring
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis can be taught trained learned
other than the specific little pieces,
[SPEAKER_01]: but We need some rock stars in these
companies now This is kind of a I think
[SPEAKER_01]: for all the companies and countries that I
work the most important thing that happens
[SPEAKER_01]: time and time again is where how I think
about this Growing long-term in
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses in California for flowers
gonna work for certain places,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the taxes suck here There's not that
much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's excited about hemp and cannabis
here But we don't grow all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: watermelons here or peppers or tomatoes or
roses We're pretty lazy when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: that standpoint for cost Or you go to
Columbia and like the coffee is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: shitty and up here You're like climbing
coffee is really good or like the apples
[SPEAKER_01]: and chili a couple weeks ago They were
like crappy and little like I always see
[SPEAKER_01]: big Chilean apples Our market is where
products drive to same with European
[SPEAKER_01]: markets So when I think about Peru or
Colombia or Uruguay or Mexico at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of April and what do these things mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe a huge thing in Austria could be
great or we're gonna have a giant concrete
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouse growing Amazing can of medical
cannabis in Germany or the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_01]: but how much does that cost?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are those crazy taxes?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the operational costs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Average wages of the Colombian workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just that was like 350 us a month So
it's like just pay them five and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like they're stoked and it's amazing for
them Same thing when we thought Macedonia
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't think about these costs like
how much does it cost to have an employee
[SPEAKER_01]: in California?
[SPEAKER_01]: This date sucks So it's not as bad as
France.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks when it comes to employment law
and we have to do the best with these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies But if you don't think about
cost how to do it consistently with
[SPEAKER_01]: certain quality assurance quality control
systems and management your visions and
[SPEAKER_01]: dreams just fail and they pop all over the
world and it's just 22 million dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: here six million dollars lost there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is a great thing You can't just
sell your garbage to Canadian public
[SPEAKER_01]: companies anymore so that whole idea of
develop everything and just flip it just
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't work and I like this little farm
guy I'm from Wisconsin with milk and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like you don't want to CBD me right now
Like what's the crap?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the price right now of a kilo of
like high quality CBD distillates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or CBG or any other of the hundreds of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't that good of an idea It was a
short period of time or think no offense
[SPEAKER_01]: like a Jan Cano or a great business model
but Like what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone's doing something any CBD side
company right now on a European basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You better be ready to understand like
novel foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happening So there'll be very very
few bonafide CBD companies in Europe and
[SPEAKER_01]: they won't produce it there It's expensive
as hell, but where do these inputs now?
[SPEAKER_01]: That you're gonna get for two thousand a
kilo one thousand five hundred What about
[SPEAKER_01]: when the price of distillate goes to two
hundred two hundred euros?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say like a high quality kilo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your business model gonna survive that
like So the the distillates in the base
[SPEAKER_01]: products for these are important But don't
just jump on certain bandwagons or because
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's going into a market can be
really dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that Get unique with these sorts
of products if you're making products or
[SPEAKER_01]: have a dispenser or manufacturing company
like know the rules of that marketplace
[SPEAKER_01]: and be specific From seeing Juana and coda
and kiva and bang like every great kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: start of a company What is it that they
did?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how do you either hitch on to
something like that or define a space or
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're in a new state like Illinois and
you get a recreational infuser license or
[SPEAKER_01]: something how to make like unique products
with that instead of we're gonna make vape
[SPEAKER_01]: pens and cartridges and sublinguals and
Suppositories and like be specific with
[SPEAKER_01]: your product offerings It's not just
Greenfield's.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many opportunities other than
just we're gonna grow dried flower and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna make oils and we're going to
The things that most people are looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: are complete failures now because it's
they didn't understand the commodification
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis and that's where like taxes
agricultural vectors daytime highs
[SPEAKER_01]: nighttime lows cheap land not 90% clay
soil like Perfect climates to do this or
[SPEAKER_01]: to process this under a high standards And
when you think international that API like
[SPEAKER_01]: with these brands They're not they're not
thinking correctly about what actually
[SPEAKER_01]: makes a qualified brand market by market
and the best thing you can do if you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: California company or others with this is
How do you have a let's say Delaware
[SPEAKER_01]: company and intellectual property company?
[SPEAKER_01]: License that intellectual property market
to market easily and just have different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis licenses in the other countries
But how do you do things consistently
[SPEAKER_01]: across the board when we can't franchise
we can't cross interstate lines I can't so
[SPEAKER_01]: pull from some of the best ideas that you
can on that side When you think about
[SPEAKER_01]: medical markets Or recreational markets,
you know inside the United States US rec
[SPEAKER_01]: markets are very different and awesome But
expensive from the tax standpoint if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't do it correctly, and this is where
what 10 almost 11 states now thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: finally Maine coming on board,
Massachusetts, Illinois just Indicative of
[SPEAKER_01]: future markets for at least a while But
that state you think what 12 current
[SPEAKER_01]: producers 40 more small ones come online
13 million people twice the size of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado We're doing about two plus
billion a year and the Midwest sucks for
[SPEAKER_01]: example more people are gonna use cannabis
because it's flat and gray like These are
[SPEAKER_01]: huge markets just exploding in our
backyard here where other ones have
[SPEAKER_01]: already happened medical is hard I'm a
medical patient from disabled military
[SPEAKER_01]: side and that market is so critical to do
right Establish it for standards do it for
[SPEAKER_01]: patients and when you switch to adult use
which is a when?
[SPEAKER_01]: How to like maintain that same like health
standards there and really protect medical
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so Anyone that's in the industry
that's not giving to like the groups That
[SPEAKER_01]: make new markets for us aka like more
patients more profits more people that
[SPEAKER_01]: need help like you're an asshole So if
you're in the rec game or the medical game
[SPEAKER_01]: like fight for more Legalization and help
and patients rights is what we've hooked
[SPEAKER_01]: on to like pretty much take over the world
And it's the most important thing too It's
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like for the first time in our
industry in the history of business if you
[SPEAKER_01]: do the right thing for like people in the
markets and Like planet like you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: growing 14 floor hydroponic indoor
warehouses in San Francisco high-tech you
[SPEAKER_01]: have 20,000 hectares in Colombia with
massive extraction and shipping that for
[SPEAKER_01]: brands created here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the impact environmentally?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you make more money in this industry
doing the right thing It's first time ever
[SPEAKER_01]: it just cost more money to do it in the
beginning, but it's worth it When we think
[SPEAKER_01]: about what were the biggest problems as
peaches as I don't know if you know
[SPEAKER_01]: peaches I figured out how to make that
slide myself Canada I've had a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: with for five six years from the LP
private side to how public companies
[SPEAKER_01]: happened So when I googled Canada sucks
For like a picture I found peaches who
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't like the club scene But the
cannabis scene there the problem was they
[SPEAKER_01]: were first and now with like the crash of
Canadian public markets Which everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: thought we're gonna be so cool for so long
like go public be billionaires not the
[SPEAKER_01]: best thing when you're building scalable
companies But they turn the whole world
[SPEAKER_01]: off to cannabis right now in a way no
offense, but with their population the
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations and true values of companies
It's hurt our investor confidence on
[SPEAKER_01]: private capital or the right capital to
grow businesses now, and they're not doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that great and if you were in that it was
kind of a bummer where you thought
[SPEAKER_01]: speculation, but Just lying about future
valuations and hurting investor
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations We're at this point now where
if you need even like working capital for
[SPEAKER_01]: a business doing 20 million dollars in
revenue a year It can be challenging,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is the best time to invest into
private companies because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: desperate They're proven and they're
scalable and it's kind of that moment of
[SPEAKER_01]: desperation where you can make some like
epic wins right now But also it means
[SPEAKER_01]: really good companies are failing and
they're having problems scale and They
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't plan for these big things and like
I said you couldn't just sell yourself to
[SPEAKER_01]: one of these big assholes They get five
ten a hundred times your actual value So
[SPEAKER_01]: now it's like the truth is really setting
in for a lot of companies And they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: entrench now for the next couple months
like to really get good positive capital
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in again But don't be like peaches
like don't be like Canada you know in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States for our big opportunities
It's still market by market by market and
[SPEAKER_01]: within these markets There's market
evolution and time and business has
[SPEAKER_01]: changed and then new laws will happen
There's like a new product offering,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found this really fun picture of
cannibalism It's happening and That's also
[SPEAKER_01]: a very profitable business model where you
have how many brands in California?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many if you're not paying for shelf
space or you're near borders or if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have really good distribution
contracts You're awesome humble weeds not
[SPEAKER_01]: making it to the market same thing in
these other states like distribution is
[SPEAKER_01]: key And it's you're thinking about federal
legalization alcohol liquor distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses tobacco type taxes when we think
about investments and placements It's what
[SPEAKER_01]: is it going to look like in that scheme?
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is so much cannibalism happening
now, and it's profitable, and it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: never thought that'd be good, but in
cannabis As a market establishes only so
[SPEAKER_01]: many companies are going to be leaders,
but for in Canada this same thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to happen, too Which I'll get
into a little bit for the next part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: year these are the most important markets
that I see other than existing and current
[SPEAKER_01]: markets or Figuring out how to
recapitalize those assets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say aka cannibalism West
Virginia's almost do we're super engaged
[SPEAKER_01]: and busy and have been in Illinois Just to
establish more to 75 more dispensaries 40
[SPEAKER_01]: more cultivation and extractions West
Virginia nice cute little verticals not
[SPEAKER_01]: that crazy hard But really good market to
start mass has been a mess, but it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: get better Maine's gonna start,
but their governor was an asshole,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's been so long and not gonna Be that
great because there's tons of illicit
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the California of the East Coast
And Cali I'm back It's biggie reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're currently working on in
California if you're here I figured I
[SPEAKER_01]: would go through the current markets that
are very important for new business as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as these ones are about to open and
Any new market like we study the laws the
[SPEAKER_01]: policies the procedures of that place is
it worth going or not are these
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities valuable or not and It's not
as valuable just to get a license And
[SPEAKER_01]: think you'll get capitalized easily and
someone will just you still have to run
[SPEAKER_01]: the business So this is step one for these
new companies Internationally,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're getting close here watch what
happens in Vienna later with the WHO if
[SPEAKER_01]: their recommendations come out for the UN
like I said it's step two of step three
[SPEAKER_01]: and like federal where Every hundred and
eighty six member country of the UN single
[SPEAKER_01]: treaty if a doctor makes a prescription
They have to provide medicine if then
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome that means that are they gonna all
produce Cannabis in their little markets
[SPEAKER_01]: like Finland probably not they're gonna
like buy pharmaceutical products from
[SPEAKER_01]: other places or the bulk oils or the bulk
flour So it's not like the u.s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like get a get a thing to like produce in
each place It's like where can you do it
[SPEAKER_01]: best at the highest standards and supply
that future market demand at the lowest
[SPEAKER_01]: cost and highest quality standards It's
gonna be so enormous the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: all of this side is so expensive
pre-clinical CRO work phase one two three
[SPEAKER_01]: like the what we're seeing though is
incredible But this is the world we play
[SPEAKER_01]: in doing US trials studies anything the US
super expensive Kind of a bummer do it
[SPEAKER_01]: other places first cheaper and then get
the same standards with like picks
[SPEAKER_01]: countries for example When I think really
what's big for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you know this guy
Salvador.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like the longest known Shipwreck
survivor of like 40 469 days went fishing
[SPEAKER_01]: with his homie a year and a half later So
like be a survivor also his homie he said
[SPEAKER_01]: died four months into it and he Put him in
the water speaking back to cannibalism
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but Salvador is the fucking man So
if he can do it you can too if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: having hard times like this market It's
amazing in the new business But the truth
[SPEAKER_01]: is starting to come out like I haven't
even been in America for four months and
[SPEAKER_01]: just working with the company seeing
what's happening It's this it's this
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all figured what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just didn't think it would be this hard
this long and persistent But the market is
[SPEAKER_01]: only gonna get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you think about how to visionary
Prospect in the industry are the laws good
[SPEAKER_01]: are the climates good like how much
capital do you actually need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand these business models more than
you could realize like one of those past
[SPEAKER_01]: slides go for San Luis Obispo or go for
this like how many people are there
[SPEAKER_01]: population demographics like
transportation history like How hard is it
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be to get building permits or
processes or licenses or permits?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is a real struggle and if you go
into another country the most important
[SPEAKER_01]: thing like if Salvador had a map and like
a Paddle this is the key How did their
[SPEAKER_01]: international their country laws work with
the international laws and policies?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how could other business models
work there and if it's not good or if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just cannabis and it's special It's not
going to be that special like in the long
[SPEAKER_01]: run there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that was about all I had I like
pandas a lot So I thought I'd put that up
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys know that pornography actually
saved the panda bear?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Read a study this was like really in the
beginning of the month that they're using
[SPEAKER_01]: animal panda porn like to like get males
males only like reproduce for two days a
[SPEAKER_01]: year they're really lazy and I Learned
about them when I was in Asia a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: So during that two days like they have to
be like amped up and the pan population
[SPEAKER_01]: was going way down this one Chinese
doctors like How could I get this to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we've got unique problems
pandas aren't reproducing or you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: raise capital or Your business is failing,
you know get creative, you know to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: the species and keep the plant going alive
Thank you all very very much Check check
[SPEAKER_02]: One more time for Nick Eastley also Let's
ask him some questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'll start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's better to look
domestically right now or to look
[SPEAKER_02]: internationally and should you be looking
for small to invest in smaller businesses
[SPEAKER_02]: or should you still trying to be in the
big multi-million conglomerate dollar game
[SPEAKER_01]: Capital comes from I think that's really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is your money because that
determines where you're gonna be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: do this sometimes there's residency
requirements, so You know, I like us
[SPEAKER_01]: things but I won't take foreign national
capital invest into us companies breaking
[SPEAKER_01]: federal law I don't think that's a good
idea and I don't like to use certain other
[SPEAKER_01]: capital so like ancillary businesses or
medical cannabis or recreational like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's You know if I was in Canada
California depending on the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: capital it's not just getting another
indoor grow, but I think that the
[SPEAKER_01]: internationals are Harder to get into
they're more expensive and you bleed in
[SPEAKER_01]: the beginning But they're gonna be the
huge hundred X plus multiples that we
[SPEAKER_01]: really want us sides are like you're solid
like 10 to 20s but some markets you get
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these new licenses in one of these
new states like one of 12 or something if
[SPEAKER_01]: you can scale that capitalize it and it's
the right state I think those are super
[SPEAKER_01]: super valuable, but if you're
internationally need a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: money And patience and a lot of patience
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one more over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have to walk over Always wear
comfortable shoes when you go to these
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always my advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what sort of advice you guys
have Hey Nick your talk a couple years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: actually made me feel comfortable to enter
this industry My question is about your
[SPEAKER_00]: consolidation slide using those comparable
markets as where we Might be headed with
[SPEAKER_00]: national legalization we've talked to a
couple regulatory attorneys about that to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to guess where we're headed and We've
heard in general that It's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: correct to look at tobacco and alcohol as
a guide For how things will go down
[SPEAKER_00]: because those were less about state rights
and cannabis has really been pushed from
[SPEAKER_00]: the state perspective so we're trying to
anticipate is the differentiation in state
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation gonna continue or are we gonna
end up with states all headed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: similar direction and We've sort of landed
well as long as it's a state's rights
[SPEAKER_00]: thing then it'll continue to be different
state to state if you could I would
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine it's gonna be a combination of the
two because we're too lazy to legalize it
[SPEAKER_01]: federally because we were the first we're
the assholes that like made it illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere in the world it's kind of like
ooh We're not gonna claim that one Also,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna try we'll protect us
businesses when we do that And so it won't
[SPEAKER_01]: be one of those models.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll be comparative Eventually
though quickly how alcohol like took
[SPEAKER_01]: forever to get legalized this is happening
very very fast so the consolidation
[SPEAKER_01]: roll-up strategy, it's more of How it's
gonna happen because even if it is
[SPEAKER_01]: state-by-state forever, which though there
will be federal They're still you know
[SPEAKER_01]: business and commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna try to figure that one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would I Would say this most important
thing is balance your books get everything
[SPEAKER_01]: ready like Audit-ready financials do shit
correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes time for some sort of
roll-up where those big companies they
[SPEAKER_01]: were just too Lazy and big and risk
adverse to come into it at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna figure it out Like you
already saw a constellation and Altria and
[SPEAKER_01]: like all these others soon If jewel has
any money after all the madness like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know these companies coming in to
It'll happen I don't know how but being
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared for it is what I've seen the most
important thing like how to roll up that
[SPEAKER_01]: business proper valuations but do it like
And plan it like a normal like once you're
[SPEAKER_01]: done with your controller actually get a
CFO plan those things so books everything
[SPEAKER_01]: ready and then depending how You know that
acquisition could happen but it you're
[SPEAKER_01]: right It is it's different than before but
it's gonna be fast and it's the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization happens and International at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to come on to it on a medical
side, but the rec side Yeah, that's good
[SPEAKER_01]: question, but it'll happen one way or
another just be ready Hey, what's up Nick
[SPEAKER_01]: good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Daniel with the San Jose
cannabis equity working group And my
[SPEAKER_03]: question for you is are you comfortable
sharing with us your biggest win and your
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest fail of 2019 2018 or 19 19 it is
2020 biggest of 19 I had a Nepotism issue
[SPEAKER_01]: which sometimes like nepotism is good like
family members Not my family very small
[SPEAKER_01]: family and they're just like oh Nick's in
the weed But like this is like some
[SPEAKER_01]: partners of mine were family and they'd
been together for a long time had a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of kids It was like very small cap table
Epic epic project they get a fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: divorce or she wants to leave him because
he's a horrible husband I've been working
[SPEAKER_01]: with him for a year and I'm like,
oh shit this shit just blew up And that's
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen one way or another so to use
that example and not the specific kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: country business project But you got to
really know like your people and trust and
[SPEAKER_01]: just you're building this Like I said
bring in new people bring in new trust is
[SPEAKER_01]: huge So failures and people is probably
like the biggest I'd say deficit of 19
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I'm fixing but that one's gonna be
beautiful to a cannibalistic I'm gonna fix
[SPEAKER_01]: that one take that shit over now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fucking awesome It's painful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like both in the same and
best one of 19 As an individual I kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: came up with a dole model with a few
groups on some international genetics and
[SPEAKER_01]: Processes to where some can produce the
bananas and some make the dried bananas
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing So those sorts of business
models long-term like genetics impact is
[SPEAKER_01]: really really critical probably a win that
not really I would like it now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the long terms on that are just huge
and also what hitting 20 billion last year
[SPEAKER_01]: You know 20% of our country is legal for
adult use purchases That's kind of a big
[SPEAKER_01]: deal and now the medical rights where we
have three more states than we skip basic
[SPEAKER_01]: medical so biggest win there I think that
we're still still around and and also the
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada finally like got exposed for the
lying shit that they were back in April
[SPEAKER_01]: May that was probably the biggest win for
the industry to I want to ask when you say
[SPEAKER_02]: when you talk about genetics being the
next Wave or whatnot is that in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: patenting them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are people gonna run into problems trying
to have proprietary is it all gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: remain?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of been somewhat open source for
a while for the most part There's always a
[SPEAKER_02]: few proprietary outliers, but what do you
think?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many types of potatoes are there in
Peru is kind of like my question to that,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean how many types of potatoes will
Monsanto let you grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not a good example currently and
that glyco phosphate thing not that good
[SPEAKER_01]: of an idea I'm at least on their breeding
side The US is very different than other
[SPEAKER_01]: countries think about Driscoll's Breeders
rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about sometimes owning the
genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like having certain varieties and
having licensing agreements With offtake
[SPEAKER_01]: agreements for said strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna give you these strawberries for
8% You can pay me and then I get first
[SPEAKER_01]: right a refusal back on all your
strawberries I'll put them in my little
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes, but you're like dirty and having to
fight pests and put up yellow sticky traps
[SPEAKER_01]: and like Greenhouses to grow my
strawberries or raspberries that's on an
[SPEAKER_01]: international scale
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like certain constant like that's
where you get into like this thing called
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry, so It's yeah, it's harder As
hell people don't go around being like I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: a dank corn farmer And I love that side
and like that's I that that's where it all
[SPEAKER_01]: came from but the sad thing is a lot of
people are gonna get just screwed
[SPEAKER_01]: Long-term when it comes to growing certain
varieties that they had licensing
[SPEAKER_01]: agreement with but in the US variety
spread So so quickly it's so hard just to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep a little cutting or tissue culture So
I think for most individuals they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: problems for using it It's just for the
big things where they're pulling out
[SPEAKER_01]: specific things that those protections are
really valuable Yeah, the assholes already
[SPEAKER_01]: protected that already, but the plants
everywhere now, so it's all right More
[SPEAKER_02]: questions That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're as educated as you want to be on
this particular subject It's a big
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot but no matter what you're
doing in the space it matters this is once
[SPEAKER_01]: in a lifetime we can create an industry
that matters that people care about and It
[SPEAKER_01]: can be impactful and super profitable,
but it's not just these buzzwords anymore
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can follow behind And think
you're gonna have a CBD company and take
[SPEAKER_01]: over the world Like that was really fun,
but like the more unique ones we keep
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing like it's barely begun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be huge It's just most of the
people it's like the curve of dissolution
[SPEAKER_01]: right now Like the same thing with the
stock market tech was cool tech got really
[SPEAKER_01]: cool But no one actually did shit all the
things crashed who did survive like we're
[SPEAKER_01]: on that downward, but it's on a curve
though It's getting larger like the volume
[SPEAKER_01]: demand So it's just it's this moment where
if you can figure out what's gonna survive
[SPEAKER_01]: and what's gonna be real It's not some new
IP tracking software for plants like
[SPEAKER_01]: there's this thing called ag it has that
already So or it's not like some
[SPEAKER_01]: blockchain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna do seed to seal like Shit
exists in all these other markets So
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just gonna buy the winners scale
into that and use when you have a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: outside industry solutions and cater them
for this You don't have to buy a $30,000
[SPEAKER_01]: bucking machine you can cut some you know
steal like food grid and like chuck
[SPEAKER_01]: through it depending but Yeah,
there's a lot of opportunities to stay
[SPEAKER_01]: diligent and know the rules I think that's
the most important thing I could leave you
[SPEAKER_01]: with the compliance side Otherwise your
businesses will fail and never happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really appreciate the opportunity to
share fresh back from Columbia One more
[SPEAKER_02]: time Nick easily Muchas gracias por su
tiempo señor Right yo hablo espanol You
