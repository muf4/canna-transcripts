[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you everybody and welcome to this
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today my panelists, because due to some
travel situations in Heathrow Airport and
[SPEAKER_00]: due to COVID, we had a couple of
cancellations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm happy to announce that we're
an all ladies panel, which is also
[SPEAKER_00]: something, a topic that I really care
about, to have the ladies on stage more
[SPEAKER_00]: and give them more visibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very happy that we're like an all
ladies panel today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the pleasure to have Claudia
Delmore, on my panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an investor and director at Black
Legend Capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do corporate finance and are M&A
expert in several sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are experts on international
legalization of cannabis and run a
[SPEAKER_00]: boutique advisory service group based in
LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also have on my panel Rhea
Green from the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's involved in a company called
iCannaLink or the founder of a company
[SPEAKER_00]: called iCannaLink.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do cannabis supply chain solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she is the publisher of Queen Queen
magazine in the UK and therefore has a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of contact with all kinds of businesses
and active in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So given that we just have a half an hour,
I'll just jump straight in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first question goes to Claudia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Claudia, provided that cannabis is not yet
federally legal in the world's largest
[SPEAKER_00]: market in the United States, cannabis
companies, any vertical have historically
[SPEAKER_00]: struggled to raise money.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have been the roadblocks for cannabis
companies this far in the capital market?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so this is, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a question that has been
discussed for many years, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've seen major changes from 2017,
18, 19, 2020, 2021, 2022.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just 2022 is extremely different
from 2021, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in general, the differences have been
that not being federally legal in most
[SPEAKER_03]: countries, I mean, at least in the main
countries, besides Canada, which was
[SPEAKER_03]: actually a very, very good example.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why Canada was able to raise this
huge amount of money through the public
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the problem of listing companies in the
big exchanges.
[SPEAKER_03]: The companies that touch the flower cannot
list on the NASDAQ or New York Stock
[SPEAKER_03]: Exchange.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that listing a company in the
big exchanges is a big source of capital,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they end up listing in the small
exchanges like the OTC market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has never been a very favorable
solution for big raise or cash flowing or
[SPEAKER_03]: growth, right, of value.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has been a problem for many,
many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we've seen many changes in the
economy, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: After the big bubble in 2019, then we got,
of course, investors got extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: disappointed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got COVID 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2020 was very difficult to raise equity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly was debt.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden in 2021, we've seen a
major shift.
[SPEAKER_03]: The equity value went up, of course,
that was also due to the elections in the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States and the expectations of
federal legalizations coming really soon
[SPEAKER_03]: or federal legislating bills like the Safe
Banking Act passing and allowing companies
[SPEAKER_03]: to source money and chip money from banks,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then after that we've seen 2021 did not
satisfy the investors, did not satisfy the
[SPEAKER_03]: expectations of federal legalizations and
all of a sudden the equity value dropped
[SPEAKER_03]: enormously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now as of June 2022, equity value,
the average equity value of companies year
[SPEAKER_03]: to date compared to June 2021,
there was a drop of 40%, 40% of equity
[SPEAKER_03]: value.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we've seen a major shift also in
raising equity versus debt, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in 2021, we've seen, of course,
equity value was much higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: So M&A activity was more frequent and
companies used to prefer using equity for
[SPEAKER_03]: acquisitions than debt.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, debt slowly but surely
became cheaper at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we know, since there's no Safe
Banking Act and you cannot raise money
[SPEAKER_03]: from regular banking, it's been extremely
expensive to finance these companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about rates in the teens,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Even over 20%, I mean, usury rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then in 2021, we've seen all of a sudden
that some of the best performing
[SPEAKER_03]: companies, best performing I mean positive
gross margin, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Trulieve, GTI, they were able to
raise debt at 7%, 8% unheard of before,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So cheap debt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this cheap debt really is only
available for big companies, multi-state
[SPEAKER_03]: operators, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: The small companies are still paying 15,
16 or plus percent in debt, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then all of a sudden, 2022, there's this
huge crash in equity value.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nobody wants to use, it's very tough to
raise equity, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Also because you're gonna get deluded a
lot as a company or acquiring other
[SPEAKER_03]: companies with equity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've seen an increase again in debt,
in debt raise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's been actually very interesting
is that lenders, big lenders companies,
[SPEAKER_03]: they are raising debt, really cheap
interest rates like on the 5%,
[SPEAKER_03]: 6% and they're making a huge spread,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is my point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super interesting to see that
developments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ria, for you, like you are more active on
the startup side and in the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is also like it's not federally
legal or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than recreational cannabis
reform, what were roadblocks that you saw
[SPEAKER_00]: for the startups companies that made it
also difficult to raise funds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, everybody's had a rocky couple of
years, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2018, there was so much momentum and
excitement about the potential of CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: products, the whole shifting legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of companies came in and came
hard and exhausted their marketing budget,
[SPEAKER_01]: then were hit by COVID and then were hit
by the novel food act.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've just had one problem after the
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it feels like also the hearts and minds
of these companies, they've kind of lost
[SPEAKER_01]: their drive and momentum and they've had
so much red tape, money, they've just
[SPEAKER_01]: thrown so much money at things like
legals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, when we're in an industry that's
so unique and doesn't work in the
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional way, so we have to think
outside the box with marketing,
[SPEAKER_01]: with banking, with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because it's just one roadblock after
the other, I think the novel food act for
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of companies was the last straw,
to be honest, and it knocked out maybe 80,
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of the small momentum that was just
starting within the CBD industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason why we created the magazine
was to be a container to document these
[SPEAKER_01]: shifts because it's such an unpredictable
territory, nobody really knows what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to happen, the time scales are
ever-changing, and it's a global ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: and each ecosystem in turn affects its
neighbours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Europe is so privileged because we're
at the point now where we can stand on the
[SPEAKER_01]: shoulders of giants because we have an
international community that are coming
[SPEAKER_01]: over and they're willing and able and
they've got resources to help us not make
[SPEAKER_01]: the mistakes that have been made over the
other side of the pond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that I've found in
Europe is the attitude here is just
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a very different paradigm towards
cannabis, we've had coffee shops in
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam for a long time, and it's not
only the population density that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe exciting for these investors,
so I think this is a prime time to
[SPEAKER_01]: optimise this window of opportunity to
create these symbiotic relationships that
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit not only the suits but the roots
and everybody in between and hopefully the
[SPEAKER_01]: main people who benefit are the users and
the consumers and the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I feel personally, I've worked in
the cannabis industry for 20 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a root or a suit, I'm a fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mum has been in the cannabis industry
for a long time and if you want to speak
[SPEAKER_01]: to experts and veterans, you don't find
them in the legal market, you find them in
[SPEAKER_01]: the legacy market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legacy market does not need the
regulators, the regulators need the legacy
[SPEAKER_01]: and once we realise this and we work in a
symbiotic harmonious way, everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a rising tide, all the ships come up
together and if we can create these
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships, that's where I believe it's
all going to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go a little, have a little look
into vertically integrated companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, verticality has had
successful cannabis apart from their
[SPEAKER_00]: competitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merger and acquisition have been the best
method of growth to remain competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do these mergers and acquisitions been
financed providing the constraints on
[SPEAKER_00]: these capital raise markets?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually touched on the very
integrated companies and the roadblocks,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The United States has been a good example
of having to recreate manufacturing
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation facilities in every state.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we have to, M&A is the solution
because you need to acquire, you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: expand and I mean, think about it,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have to start as a vertically
integrated company, start cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities, extraction facilities,
manufacturing facilities in every state,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it takes time, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So might as well just acquire the
companies that already have been
[SPEAKER_03]: successful or they're already existing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now, I mean, lately we've seen also a
lot of M&A from public companies to public
[SPEAKER_03]: companies, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Verona Goodness and of course now Columbia
Care and Cresco Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we just said five minutes ago that
equity value dropped enormously in the
[SPEAKER_03]: past year and why are these companies
doing stock to stock, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: All stock acquisitions and that's because
if the acquirer stocks dropped,
[SPEAKER_03]: also the target stocks dropped,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also for the target companies,
it makes sense to sell and receive and be
[SPEAKER_03]: paid with stocks because they know the
upside.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the moment, the market is trailing at a
big discount and we have an EBITDA
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple in 2022 of 6%, six times,
sorry, and 2023 of five times EBITDA
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple, which is, you know, typical of
mature industry and not definitely not,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, growing and upcoming and,
you know, in the industry with all of this
[SPEAKER_03]: upside all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, you know, it's basically way
better to, as I said, to use debt or to
[SPEAKER_03]: use equity only if you're acquiring with
equity in other company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ria, what about the UK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see a lot of M&A happening in the
UK or what is the situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the companies more vertically
integrated or do you have more specialist
[SPEAKER_00]: countries?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the situation there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the only way the companies are
going to work in the UK is if they've got
[SPEAKER_01]: American partners realistically because
they're coming with the experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: the knowledge and the money and they're
just forward thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're thinking about the future and
the long-term plan and they're not looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for an immediate return, they can work in,
within Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at cookies, for example,
even though it's not a legal market,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're getting their clothes in brand
shops all over Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're preparing for things to change,
even though they don't know what it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be or how long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the long game players look
at it through lifestyle, through culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: through celebrating things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, realistically, all the market
that's coming through the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: patients, the notoriety come from people
like Rick Simpson, Frenchy Coloney,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's another legend that's part of the
black market, the great, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: black, it's not, they were original
legends and foundations of then we've
[SPEAKER_01]: stood on the shoulders of giants and these
are all from the fringe, fringe illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: people that had the bottle to go out and
do things because they had a need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their need was more important than the
financial benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just out of interest, let me do a crowd
participation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who in this room is here because they have
a personal story about cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has helped them over in their
personal health or in their own family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think these are the people that are
going to change the industry because their
[SPEAKER_01]: drive isn't conventional, their drive's
deeper, the purpose is more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, as a daughter of a patient,
as somebody who's treated cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: 7,000 patients illegally for the past six
years in the UK, personally, if I spend
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of my life working for this plan,
I could still not repay everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: she's given me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's a lot of people that
feel the same way and it's that passion
[SPEAKER_01]: and that drive and that fire that's going
to make sure that this doesn't become
[SPEAKER_01]: extinguished.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I loved what Jamie said on the panel
earlier about it's the CEO who's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have the biggest balls and I believe that
CEO is going to be a woman and that's why
[SPEAKER_01]: we're telling the story through the women
and what I believe the female way to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: a story is it's a circular model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the beautiful thing about this
industry is there isn't one person in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world who knows everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't one doctor you can go to who
can give you all the answers there isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: one specialist but there's a circular
model of everybody who's got a little
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of the puzzle and it's forcing us to
come into a situation where now is the
[SPEAKER_01]: time for radical collaboration and we need
to work like nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nature doesn't compete, it
collaborates and if we can work out what
[SPEAKER_01]: that looks like, the foundations we lay in
these next 10 years are going to be found
[SPEAKER_01]: for decades if not centuries to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: This window of opportunity is a privilege,
you know, those with the privilege to know
[SPEAKER_01]: have the duty to act.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people in this room and tomorrow we're
laying foundations that are far bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: than us and if we don't do it with
integrity and correctness what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: future years going to look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got 100 years of R&D to do because
it's been prohibited globally so we
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't got time to waste and we haven't
got time to mess around.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much talent and beauty and
skill and passion in this industry the
[SPEAKER_01]: next 10 years are going to be key and the
only way to do that is with sharing and
[SPEAKER_01]: mergers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for saying that, it's very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's have a look at a little bit of
trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some trends that have been
holding capital raises in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Claudia?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well actually, I mean we just touched on
this, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: 2022 has been very difficult to raise
equity as you said because of the lower
[SPEAKER_03]: value in equity so more debt, even the
debt funds have raised a lot of money with
[SPEAKER_03]: cheap interest rates for them and high
interest rates for the companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the moment, let's say that equity
raises year to date are like down 70%,
[SPEAKER_03]: something like this, 74% in the United
States, even more in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Debt raises are high a lot in the United
States but also very, very down in like
[SPEAKER_03]: 90% in Canada year to date.
[SPEAKER_03]: As of June 2022, so basically it's like a
moment of pause, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: This in addition to the general public
markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean the regular S&P 500 and the other
industries, everything is down so if you
[SPEAKER_03]: speak with any investment bank or
investors, they kind of, at this very
[SPEAKER_03]: moment they're saying that they're just
waiting for the dust to settle basically
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's why you see a lot of concern
about solidations right now for economies
[SPEAKER_03]: of scale and ability to continue growing,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: With just acquisition of stocks to stocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd like to, Rhea Victoria,
she's an expert in the industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: more in the legacy industry while I come
from a finance world so it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask her, what do you think the
legal, the legal space of the industry can
[SPEAKER_03]: take as examples or directions from the
legacy world in terms of growth and
[SPEAKER_01]: survival?
[SPEAKER_01]: Best product wins.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a good product, it'll last a
test of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're selling a crappy product because
you expect your audience to not know the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between a good product and a
bad product, then you don't deserve to
[SPEAKER_01]: succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're giving bad products to cancer
patients and people that are really
[SPEAKER_01]: suffering and need them, need that
medicine and it isn't the best you can
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly produce, why are you doing it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you've got a good product
and you're coming from a good place,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are the ones that will last the test
of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you grow organically without big
fundraising if your products are
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is where we created ICANA Link
because we found there's such a need
[SPEAKER_01]: because even though we speak in the same
language, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: The investors and the money people aren't
speaking to the legacy people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we was at the Mary Jane show
and, you know, hydro guys and black market
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, they were very special.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't talk to everybody and they
don't open up to everybody and they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to talk to the suits necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even want to and not only do
they not want to, they haven't got time,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't want investment and they think
the whole thing's dirty, ironically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if we can create these tools
that become the bridge, that's what ICANA
[SPEAKER_01]: Link is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way of bringing in all our
expertise from the I mean, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking to somebody with over 10 years
experience, they haven't got that
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in a legal market and why would
you want someone with less than 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: experience doing anything for your
company?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using ICANA Link as a bridge for
industry to connect with black market and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're using Green Queen magazine to
document the story and shape the narrative
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly with the three pillars of
destigmatisation, decentralisation,
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalisation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't give it us back because it's
ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to claim it and I think that this
process, this dance that happens between
[SPEAKER_01]: the legal market and the legacy market is
the legacy market's all about education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you go to these weed shows and
secret sessions and cups, they've got so
[SPEAKER_01]: much knowledge in the room, it's above and
beyond what you could eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some people you can get to them and
they could just keep going for hours,
[SPEAKER_01]: days and yet you've got patience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were speaking to Hannah Deacon who's a
legend in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her certainly was the first child to get
cannabis prescription and she's been
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting endlessly for epileptic children
access and she said on one of the panels
[SPEAKER_01]: that we did, she said, I don't care
whether it's good, I don't care whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the best, I just want it to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to know any of this
information that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want it to work for my son and I
don't want to have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the two different languages
that we're talking but actually if we
[SPEAKER_01]: bring in the best products and we bring in
the best teams and we bring in this
[SPEAKER_01]: experience that's been learnt through the
trial of fire, what else could happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: But succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if we come in with the best
intentions, the best will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can create these vehicles that
allow the black market to connect to the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, that's where it will be
optimised.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also did something interesting
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You issued an NFT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we also have alternative fundraising
models happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only debt and equity investment
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are still so many different
options nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you let us know a little bit about
that and how that went?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, the cannabis industry is it might be
short of many things but not creativity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mother of invention is necessity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because we can't go to conventional
routes like banks, we're having to think
[SPEAKER_01]: outside the box a little bit with how to
fundraise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we created an Ethereum smart contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: It exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was created on the 22nd of the 2nd
2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea was to use it as a
fundraising platform to then feed back
[SPEAKER_01]: into all of our other projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: As many things, it's another lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: In how to do things right and wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think even though nobody understands
NFTs at the moment doesn't mean they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to be integrated into every
industry over the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though we are first in the space,
we're trying to integrate things like
[SPEAKER_01]: utility, events and create these
partnerships in the digital world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two aspects to sharing
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's knowledge and wisdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wisdom is this example of like an
ongoing teaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your relationship with your business
partner, your children, the forest,
[SPEAKER_01]: your yoga practice, it continues to teach
you, it continues to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas knowledge is like a snapshot,
like a photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you get somebody who's written a
book two years ago, it was a snapshot of
[SPEAKER_01]: their knowledge then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they think something completely
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're doing is we're creating both
simultaneously to celebrate this culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the wisdom is the web page,
the onsite portal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a metaverse training academy
that's in the wings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the NFT and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got this digital wisdoms about
creating a container for the community so
[SPEAKER_01]: we continue to grow through each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then simultaneously we're doing a
printed book that's kind of bringing back
[SPEAKER_01]: these collectible, physical printed things
because we're taking back our history.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing they stole from us was the
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And afterwards everything was a domino
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can take back the story and
start celebrating the things that this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant does through personal, real people,
how could you argue with it not being
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible?
[SPEAKER_01]: So our pillars are health, environment,
social activism and culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the problems we've got
with cannabis is the compartmentalization
[SPEAKER_01]: of, oh, this is medical, this is
recreational, this is hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a plant and it's a human right and we
should all have access to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this plant is the biggest solution we
have to so many of the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as somebody who deals with sick
patients, we have 7,000 patients over six
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I think cannabis gives in the most
hopeless time, in the most desperate time,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the worst time in people's life,
it gives them hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the custodians of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a position of service.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't about making money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, obviously we're here to make money,
but the money should reflow and
[SPEAKER_01]: re-irrigate back into the ecosystem that
benefits everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we work like that, we use nature
as the example and everybody thrives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what the plant is
constantly teaching us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you give, the more you are given.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very interesting the struggle between
doing something good and idealist and
[SPEAKER_03]: actually just going for the money and
making a profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've seen both in this industry
because we got Wall Street in,
[SPEAKER_03]: we got activists and scientists,
the researchers in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's going to be very
interesting to see how this develops
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the world with developing
countries coming online, producing for
[SPEAKER_03]: developed countries, legislation kind of
creating reasons for slowdowns.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we see in the United States all
this cultivation facilities done in
[SPEAKER_03]: Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what will happen when federal
legalization happens and Mexico goes
[SPEAKER_03]: completely legal to those states?
[SPEAKER_03]: But also at the same time, in the US
there's a big deal about social equity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you know about that and if
there's a similar situation in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: But social equity is basically helping
minorities in developing their dreams and
[SPEAKER_03]: establishing businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that is also very
important, but it has to be done in an
[SPEAKER_03]: intelligent way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I want to advise someone who doesn't
have the same opportunities as someone
[SPEAKER_03]: graduating from Harvard or whatever,
I wouldn't just tell them to go into a
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation facility in Massachusetts
because in the next few years they're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to go bankrupt, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to actually help them to be
successful, not to fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there's a lot of ignorance
around all of this and legalization is
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely going to and international
trade is going to affect the success of
[SPEAKER_03]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then again, we go back to the funding
and why some companies, especially the
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer product focused companies,
are trying to take the market in North
[SPEAKER_03]: America, which is a cash flow rich market,
mostly because of recreational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: While wellness and pharmaceutical
companies are investing and focusing
[SPEAKER_03]: operationally and financially into Latin
America, Europe or Asia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Asia is going to be the biggest market and
nobody even talks about it, but it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be strictly medicinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, so there's a lot of M&A,
a lot of expansion with different
[SPEAKER_02]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just mentioned also the recreational
cannabis reform in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally hope that with all this
recreational reform sweeping across the
[SPEAKER_00]: globe, that we will also have improvements
in other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think will, for example,
for the states change in the current
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with capital markets once
they potentially legalize on a national
[SPEAKER_00]: level?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you mean like capital markets and
federal legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: The openness towards investment with
federal reform coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure everybody knows about this in
this room.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, if you come from oil and gas
or consumer products or there will a
[SPEAKER_03]: pharma and you're a fund manager,
you raise your money from institutional
[SPEAKER_03]: sources such as endowments, insurances,
pension funds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were talking about billions and
billions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: While in cannabis, you can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: You raise money from high net worth and
family offices.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So also there is a difference between
private equity and public equity and,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course, the private debt because right
now there's not much commercial bank debt,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in private equity, again, they source
money from high net worth, family offices,
[SPEAKER_03]: very limited money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the private equity funds are
struggling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they have a nice name.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've done a lot of work, but they're
not big funds.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not much money available.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've been focusing mostly on private
equity strategies, always long term,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exit for any industry, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've been focusing more on ancillary
companies, non-touching the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: companies, while the public equity,
such as hedge funds, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They always have more capital.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because they go to pension funds,
absolutely, but because they trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hedge funds, you know, they trade the
market and therefore they just have bigger
[SPEAKER_03]: volumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's more of an arbitrage,
a short term.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, taking advantage of the
situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is why we've seen in Canada so
much money being raised since 2016 and 17.
[SPEAKER_03]: The public equity have been focusing more
on touching the plant companies,
[SPEAKER_03]: such as cultivation, retail dispensaries,
and manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it just generates more cash flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, with all of its problems,
it just regenerates faster cash flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's some of the trends that we've
seen right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, you know, lenders.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, lenders prefer cultivation and
retail because they have collateral,
[SPEAKER_03]: right, for safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's been, you know, most of the
money raised has been into these sectors,
[SPEAKER_03]: much less into pharma or ancillary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe something you still want to add to
that also, given that UK also doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been in contact, for example,
with a couple of investors from the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they cannot invest in Germany,
for example, due to that fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they don't have cannabis reform in
the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think the best way for everything
to work is global decriminalisation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether that's going to happen or not is
another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think all this red tape that's being
created is making us think outside the
[SPEAKER_01]: box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing we're not sure of in this
industry is creativity, like we said
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the best example as we can
look at is if we look at nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the greatest minds in the world
always look at nature as the best example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how does cannabis work in the body?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, homeostasis and adaptogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does homeostasis mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It means all the cells share their
resources and poisons and they communicate
[SPEAKER_01]: to each other to allow the ecosystem,
the whole thing, to thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the adaptogen aspect is each area
needs something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant has this amazing,
intelligent healing that fills the gaps
[SPEAKER_01]: that it needs at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very difficult to articulate that
because the plant's driving, in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what will happen, I believe,
if we come from a point of service,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is driving and she's got all the
answers, I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our time is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to the beautiful ladies on
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any questions,
feel free to approach us outside because
[SPEAKER_00]: we now have to give up the stage to the
next.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time for Lisa and Claudia and
Victoria Green.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very informative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
