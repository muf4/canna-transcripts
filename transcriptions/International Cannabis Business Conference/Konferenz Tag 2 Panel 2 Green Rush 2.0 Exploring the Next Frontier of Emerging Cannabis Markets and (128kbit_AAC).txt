[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are the troopers that are here for the
Friday morning session, and you shall be
[SPEAKER_03]: rewarded with a wonderful conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to introduce you to my fabulous
panelists.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is David.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very important thing to know about him is
that he used to be a professional
[SPEAKER_03]: bodybuilder, an award-winning professional
bodybuilder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in his spare time, he spends his time
in his home gym teaching his nine-year-old
[SPEAKER_03]: son how to also be a buff fitness pro,
which I think is pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Share a little bit about your company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you very much, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great to be here again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was here last year, and wonderful to be
here again, seeing the crowds and the
[SPEAKER_02]: interest around this industry that's
forming in one way or other.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the good, the bad, and
occasionally the ugly that we're seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: around the industry, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been about 11 years now working in
this space, originally in Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: working on licensing, compliance,
security areas, and over the years just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of saw that there was a global market
forming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I worked on quite a few projects as the
markets rolled out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany, some of the consulting for the
early producers here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, I was about to really launch
into the global side when COVID came.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after COVID now, I've been getting back
into the global side.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do M&A across the global cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So working on acquisitions, mergers,
some smart investment, work as well as the
[SPEAKER_02]: capital markets have tightened up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, again, excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Carmen is a bit of a speed demon.
[SPEAKER_03]: She used to drive race cars, and in her
spare time, she likes to hurdle herself
[SPEAKER_03]: down mountains, either on skis or
bicycles, going as fast as she possibly
[SPEAKER_03]: can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now in her spare time, what there is
of it, she manages a race car team so
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll be sure to have to learn more about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But tell us a little bit more about your
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Marina, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Carmen Doran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the CEO of Helios Therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are New Zealand's largest licensed
producer of medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helios is a medicines company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very much focused on delivering
outcomes for patients and have moved at
[SPEAKER_00]: speed to be able to do that in New
Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things probably is a little bit
of background around the New Zealand
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is just to understand the
environment in which we work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are a full medical market in New
Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any doctor can prescribe for any
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that came in on the 1st of October in
2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 4th of October 2021, just four days
later, Helios launched our first products
[SPEAKER_00]: into market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're coming up on two years of
products into market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year we launched New Zealand grown,
New Zealand made medicines, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: really able to drive access and
affordability for our patients in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great to be able to come here and
share some of what's happening in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Zealand with all of you this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter, the true love of his life is a
gorgeous, is she a lab, a golden lab?
[SPEAKER_03]: A golden retriever.
[SPEAKER_01]: A golden retriever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Name Daisy, who is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any other dog people in the
audience?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I see a show of hands about who my dog
people are?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in his spare time, he likes to surf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have seen a video of this man
absolutely shredding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell us a little bit about your
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Hillary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Peter Croc, I consider myself one of
the veterans of cannabis in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven years ago, I joined Can Group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was CEO at Can Group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the first to be launched.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm licensed in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also the founding chair of the
MCIA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wearing that hat here today as chair
of the peak industry body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got a great delegation here from
Australia and sitting right next to New
[SPEAKER_01]: Zealand, funnily enough, across the ditch
in room two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, here to see what's happening on
the global scale and Australia's role to
[SPEAKER_01]: play in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fabulous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll just introduce myself very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started distributing medical cannabis in
the mid-90s in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started the movement that turned into
an industry in Canada and then spent the
[SPEAKER_03]: past few years in the C-suite of Canopy
Growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm doing independent consulting
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first thing that I want to ask you,
and any one of you can chime in,
[SPEAKER_03]: is do you think that in Australia or New
Zealand or other emerging markets,
[SPEAKER_03]: are we going to be able to avoid the same
boom and bust that we experienced in
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada from hyped up value valuations and
inflated market predictions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I might start with that one because in
fact, we've already been there,
[SPEAKER_01]: done that in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely got caught up in the
Canadian bubble as it was inflating with
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole rec market coming on and the
excitement that happened back in 2017 and
[SPEAKER_01]: 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Australian system only came into
effect in 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was announced 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the first license in March of that
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was right when Canada was in full
inflation mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had Canadian activity in our part
of the world as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the Canadian bubble burst,
that definitely had effect right around
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has meant that we've had to pull
our horns in in Australia and New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because we've got such a good
regulatory structure underlying it,
[SPEAKER_01]: though, we've gone through that rough
patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're now in a really strong position
to move forward without it just being seen
[SPEAKER_01]: as another bubble coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's inflating carefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I've been here this week,
I've heard some pretty dramatic and
[SPEAKER_03]: optimistic predictions for the rapid
exponential growth of the German market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really does make me worry that
we're not learning from the lessons of
[SPEAKER_03]: what we've experienced in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you seeing in other countries
around the world that you're working in in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of this issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, definitely, when you look at
the Canadian situation, what happened,
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely a learning curve, I think,
for the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I lived it close by.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually involved and very close to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think really, when I was here a year
ago, I look at valuations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at company performance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at performance metrics,
forecasting, and look at what this
[SPEAKER_02]: company's saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Might they be successful?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you've got to pick winners and
losers sometimes in this industry if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're an investor, especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's been a big difference
from last year to this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: A year ago, we were still seeing the
really high valuations, particularly in
[SPEAKER_02]: the European market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some companies that had, were really
basing their valuations on projections and
[SPEAKER_02]: forecasts that, frankly, weren't really
defensible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think now, even to this year,
there's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing now, we see a bit more
realism in terms of the valuations that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the private side, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: The public side, to a degree, as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's maybe not quite caught up yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely seeing some evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the investor class are
learning from what's happened around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world, particularly in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're adjusting themselves and
they expect to see more veracity to these
[SPEAKER_02]: pitch decks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Assumptions, it's not going to be $10 a
gram or $15 a gram or whatever it is in
[SPEAKER_02]: this market or that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually going to be more like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the market size is not going to be
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be more like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I think we're seeing a bit of
now, although there's still quite a long
[SPEAKER_02]: way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to add anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my Nana always used to tell me that bad
luck can happen to anyone, but you make
[SPEAKER_00]: your own good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that New Zealand, for us,
our cannabis industry started coming
[SPEAKER_00]: online just as COVID hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the whole country went into
lockdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went into a global financial
crisis and depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we probably haven't seen the crash in
valuations just because of the timing of
[SPEAKER_00]: when our industry came on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We absolutely had some companies that were
at higher valuations in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: including Helios, that have now come down
to more realistic valuations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there hasn't been the multiples crash
that we've seen in other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that actually quietly
delivering down in New Zealand a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the New Zealand cannabis companies for
what they have delivered already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the potential they have to go into the
global markets are undervalued.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of publicly listed
companies in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helios is a private company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been able to do that all through
individual investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it'll be interesting to
see how things settle and how the
[SPEAKER_00]: valuations play out as now the New Zealand
companies start exporting into markets
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: David, another one for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really have your finger on the
pulse of the global supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering if you can tell us a
little bit about the countries that you
[SPEAKER_03]: work in, how you characterize them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then let's just get right down to it
and tell us about the range of the price
[SPEAKER_03]: point for companies that are selling into
those countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think, again, we're seeing a
very, very variable global market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's an assumption sometimes
that the EU is a monolith.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all those countries are somewhat
similar or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, they're all very,
very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even in Germany, all the states have
slightly different takes on elements of
[SPEAKER_02]: import, export, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot to learn out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the first things I'll
probably repeat a few times, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of sources that folks get information
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: This conference is, of course,
one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I encourage you to do that and to be
insatiable in terms of your take up of
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all sources aren't the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you need to be cautious about what
you assume or what you know, what you
[SPEAKER_02]: learn about the global markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sources of data are quite narrow,
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of really reliable data
out there that's up to speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of how I kind of characterize the
different market segments, I think there
[SPEAKER_02]: are some countries that I would call
pre-rec markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're medical, of course, but they're a
pre-rec, whether it's self-payers,
[SPEAKER_02]: as in Germany, or whether there's other
reasons why the medical market is partly
[SPEAKER_02]: medical patients that have sometimes
serious needs, other times
[SPEAKER_02]: wellness-related, but they're still a
medicinal patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we have the pre-rec idea where
really you see a microcosm of Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we've heard a lot
at this conference already and talking,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in the evening, what's new in
Canada, what strains are coming out,
[SPEAKER_02]: where's the craft next drop?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's upcoming?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think some of the companies in
countries like Germany, and I think it
[SPEAKER_02]: would be Australia too, actually,
are looking at what's happening on the
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting edge of, in California too,
and what can we grasp onto and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: bring into our market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The German market is getting a little
busier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there are about maybe 150 odd
different products, I think 600 listings,
[SPEAKER_02]: so some companies are multiplying the
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the interesting thing is a lot of
those products are running out,
[SPEAKER_02]: and to me, that kind of again underlines
one of the key things I think in these
[SPEAKER_02]: different market segments is, as a
supplier into those markets and a
[SPEAKER_02]: distributor, if you can't latch onto
reliable supply that is consistent,
[SPEAKER_02]: that hits a similar mark, and you can
replenish those orders on and on,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've seen the harm that does,
certainly in Canada and other countries,
[SPEAKER_02]: where once you lose the confidence of the
patient, you're really in a sticky spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to roll up, pre-rec market
countries, Australia would be in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany would be in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have pure medical, UK I think is pure
medical, I think New Zealand probably is
[SPEAKER_02]: more pure medical, where we have it's much
more of a very focused medical paradigm,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the idea of a pre-rec kind of thing
really, or a rec is in the legacy market,
[SPEAKER_02]: or black market for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are some emerging markets
too that are fairly interesting around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we're looking at some of the
European countries, Poland is coming on,
[SPEAKER_02]: Brazil is a country that's got things
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, I think the key to this is to
really educate yourself as if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating and producing into the market,
if you're distributing, wherever you're on
[SPEAKER_02]: the value chain, if you're looking at the
global market as a playground for
[SPEAKER_02]: business, you need to know where to play
and how to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really to me the critical thing,
and it was a bit crass about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: your success relies on your knowledge and
understanding of where to choose to
[SPEAKER_02]: channel your products or your interest,
and how to negotiate and navigate that
[SPEAKER_02]: with respect to getting those products
into market in a reliable way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And David, I was just going to say in
terms of characterising Australia as a
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-rec market, you're pointing there at
the volume of flour that's being sold into
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia, but I'd push hard on the fact
that from a medical focus and perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia's in a really strong position,
and it is absolutely where we're focused
[SPEAKER_01]: around bringing the science into
cannabinoids and medicine, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory environment we have there,
and that's why it's important people
[SPEAKER_01]: understand if they're going to be bringing
product into Australia and how it'll play
[SPEAKER_01]: in that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: The GMP requirement and the law changes as
of tomorrow, so 1st of July TGO 93 has a
[SPEAKER_01]: requirement that imports are equivalent
quality to GMP, so that needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: understood, but having that framework in
place, the real opportunity we see is that
[SPEAKER_01]: being the basis for bringing clinical
trial work to Australia, and that
[SPEAKER_01]: capability is going to, from a medical
perspective, really be an important avenue
[SPEAKER_01]: forward for the global industry,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to come back to talking about
price program in terms of the price that
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is selling into these markets,
and then how that corresponds to what the
[SPEAKER_03]: patients are paying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So perhaps you can talk a little bit about
the range of what you're seeing of price
[SPEAKER_03]: per gram, and then I'd love to hear about
what patients are paying per gram in both
[SPEAKER_03]: New Zealand and Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, pricing is very elastic,
and pricing is not a stable thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly in the Canadian market,
we've seen a decimation of the B2B market,
[SPEAKER_02]: where high-quality craft Canadian cannabis
can be selling for $1.50, $1.50 a gram in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canadian, which is hard to say,
considering it costs that much almost to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow it, so it's been very challenging,
and there's lots of reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be a focus for today's
panel, but the Canadian market is
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult, and so there's lots of
exporters from Canada that are looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: the higher price point in the global
market, so that's one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: things to know about how the global
industry is moving around, because there's
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of pressure from Canada and lots of
flour from Canada that wants to go into
[SPEAKER_02]: the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at the pricing into Israel,
there's obviously a large market.
[SPEAKER_02]: That pricing has moved around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what we're seeing right now is
anywhere from a, I'm going to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: Canadian dollars, probably from like a
$2.75 to $3.75, $4.00 type pricing into
[SPEAKER_02]: Israel for decent quality craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we get into a market like Australia,
again, there's categories, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: of product, and all the different
distributors pay different prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no set limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Australia, I've seen pricing
actually get fairly low, but I've also
[SPEAKER_02]: seen pricing up at $5, $6 Canadian a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably five is probably a good number to
say as a target if you're selling into
[SPEAKER_02]: that market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany, I think there's a little bit more
opportunity if you are really doing craft
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis that really ticks all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: For better or worse, high THC,
which is an issue that I think is quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: debatable point with what we should be
doing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: High terpene profile, bag appeal,
all those boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can see up to a price of 450
euros a gram, 4, 450 around that range,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're seeing roughly maybe double that
for sales into the pharmacies roughly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a bit of a guide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it very much depends on the quality
of the product and the players involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're talking in euros, and now I want
to talk about the price per gram to
[SPEAKER_03]: patients in your countries, but I'm not
doing the math on the fly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to hear about what patients
are paying per gram, and also insurance
[SPEAKER_03]: structures in terms of if there's coverage
for patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk a little bit about which patients are
eligible for what kind of insurance
[SPEAKER_03]: coverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: From an Australian perspective,
pretty simple math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flour, around $10 a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about six euro, I think,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the patient level.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some health cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not under the PBS, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pharmaceutical benefits scheme in
Australia, you have to have a registered
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine go through that process,
and all of the product in Australia is
[SPEAKER_01]: being sold under the special access scheme
as an unregistered medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a range that's been happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the imports previously where they've
been importing under TGO 93, the
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutics goods order that remained
silent on the GMP requirement meant that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have seen a whole lot of flour come in
from Canada and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's quite a range of quality
product that's around, and patients in
[SPEAKER_01]: that space are quite discerning,
and it's been an interesting space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think as that washes through now,
and there has been a pile of material
[SPEAKER_01]: pushed into Australia ahead of the change
in the legislation, but I think we'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: that settle down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you, with the rules
changing literally tomorrow, how long do
[SPEAKER_00]: you think it will be before the pricing in
Australia settles down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you got a prediction on where it will
land?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe explain about the rules that are
changing tomorrow in case everybody in the
[SPEAKER_03]: audience isn't quite up to speed with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: TGO 93 is the technical term, therapeutic
goods order.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they introduced cannabis and opened
up the special access pathway scheme as
[SPEAKER_01]: unregistered medicines, they had a
requirement that anything came in had to
[SPEAKER_01]: be free of contaminants, heavy metals,
aflatoxin, ochratoxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But someone worked out pretty early on,
oh hang on, they didn't say anything about
[SPEAKER_01]: GMP, whereas Australian manufactured
material, any licensed operator in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia has to produce to GMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only allowed to export GMP quality
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a not altogether helpful
oversight in how the legislation was put
[SPEAKER_01]: into play to start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it helped get the ball rolling,
and because we didn't yet have an industry
[SPEAKER_01]: producing any material, it meant that we
could bring material in, and that worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then some entrepreneurial people
worked out, hang on, we can actually get a
[SPEAKER_01]: technical term shitload of material in
that doesn't come in with that GMP
[SPEAKER_01]: overhead on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a lot of talk right now
about what I'm hearing is GMP washing in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of people trying to figure out how
they can still check the boxes on being
[SPEAKER_03]: able to get their product into Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's also an interesting
conversation, the difference between GMP
[SPEAKER_03]: and quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You talk about bag appeal and how well
it's cured and how well it's trimmed,
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot of the conversation that I'm
hearing really I think is assuming that a
[SPEAKER_03]: GMP product is going to be the highest
quality product, and in fact I think we
[SPEAKER_03]: know from a consumer perspective that
that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, I think the really important
thing is that underlying all of this is
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that what we don't want to have
is confidence undermined at the patient
[SPEAKER_01]: level, at the prescriber level,
and probably the kicker in all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: which comes back to you really do need to
understand the technicality of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: required to have product in there is that,
and the TGA made it really clear at our
[SPEAKER_01]: conference this year at A Cannabis,
that if they find product that's not fit
[SPEAKER_01]: for purpose that's being transacted in the
market, it's actually not just the product
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor that brought the product in,
but the prescribing doctor, the pharmacist
[SPEAKER_01]: who issued the product, they're all liable
to be prosecuted by the TGA and they made
[SPEAKER_01]: that pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to what we're trying to do here is
establish an industry where you know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not all going to be based on Australian
grown and produced material.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's absolutely scope for cannabis to
move around the world in all directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we don't want to see happen is
confidence undermined and doctors being
[SPEAKER_01]: put in a position where they say,
hang on, this doesn't look anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you it wasn't real and they push
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of some of the places where your
regulatory framework has some teeth that's
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit different than other
countries, maybe you can share with us
[SPEAKER_03]: about your driving legislation and how you
feel like that's impacting the growth of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Australian market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a really good question and
it's a discrimination that's happening
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis in Australia is it's been
caught under this legislation where if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a driver and you're found to have
cannabinoids in your system, the police
[SPEAKER_01]: are obliged to prosecute you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter if you're impaired or
not and as an industry, they're obliged to
[SPEAKER_01]: prosecute you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no discretion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no discretion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other than in Tasmania, we've got a
small island to the south that someone
[SPEAKER_01]: made a legislative mistake and it's an
oversight that actually allows people in
[SPEAKER_01]: Tasmania who are using medicine to treat a
condition to still drive, which is exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what should happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not saying anyone should be driving
while they're impaired, but there's no way
[SPEAKER_01]: they should be prosecuted for having
cannabinoids in their system and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: having a huge impact at patient level
where even in my own family, I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: people who know it would be useful to help
with sleep or with pain, but are not
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared to take cannabis because they
can't afford to not drive and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: worried that they'll be picked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a key focus for us is to get
that drive change.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole push along that line that
we're saying treat it like any other
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're talking to their prescribing
doctor and managing it, they should be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to manage and understand how and when
they can use medicine for their quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: life and not impact on driving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would comment that that kind of
stigma that permeates regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: frameworks is a hangover from prohibition
and it's really important I think to
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to unpack the history of
prohibition in North America and for us
[SPEAKER_03]: all to really understand how racist that
legislation was and what the intention of
[SPEAKER_03]: it was and for us to realize it as we're
regulating cannabis around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we don't address that part of the
history of prohibition, if we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: address it with our regulators,
if we aren't informing and educating
[SPEAKER_03]: people about the history of prohibition,
we actually will see that kind of stigma
[SPEAKER_03]: permeate the regulatory framework and
cause those kinds of really serious
[SPEAKER_03]: discriminations for patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Canada, our regulatory framework,
we legalized cannabis with the intention
[SPEAKER_03]: to minimize the harms of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because my government said,
hey, I'm really sorry about the hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: years of lies and all of the lives that
were ruined and people that were jailed
[SPEAKER_03]: and that all of the indigenous and brown
and black people were disproportionately
[SPEAKER_03]: punished.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we figure out a way to correct
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so even though we have legalized
cannabis in Canada, both for medical and
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational purposes, the stigma that
permeates the regulatory framework is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually strangling our industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So high taxation, over regulation,
we're not allowed to talk to consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually doing the ethical and
purpose-filled and values-based work
[SPEAKER_03]: around addressing the history of
prohibition, we don't just do it because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually needs to happen in order to be
able to build healthy, functional
[SPEAKER_03]: industries around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brief rant from your moderator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's talk about New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Carmen, as I've had the
opportunity to get to know you,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the things that I really appreciate
about your narrative is you are really
[SPEAKER_03]: patient-focused.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't hear you talking about market size
and margins.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hear you talking about patient
outcomes and you have a beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: patient-centric approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that is that approach is
growing your market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tell us about how you see the stigma
dissolving in New Zealand and how and why
[SPEAKER_03]: that's happening and what you and the
other companies are doing to address those
[SPEAKER_03]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe to help put into context,
let me start with the numbers that I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't spoken about already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll give you some insight as to
how we've been able to move the dial on
[SPEAKER_00]: those numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was here last year at ICBC,
we were talking about 30,000 patients in
[SPEAKER_00]: New Zealand accessing medicinal cannabis
in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a small nation, just five million
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2022, we had 60,000 prescriptions
written for medicinal cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: so a double.
[SPEAKER_00]: We predicted that 2023, it was gonna
double again to around 120,000
[SPEAKER_00]: prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually halfway through the year,
we see that the market is growing faster
[SPEAKER_00]: than what we thought it was gonna be and
it will land higher than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is because people are talking to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medicine is actually really helping
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is patient-driven and
patient-led.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they might be talking to their neighbor
over the back fence and their neighbor is
[SPEAKER_00]: complaining about not sleeping and they
say, oh, I'm trying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you try that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So where the gap then falls is to the
prescribers because a patient goes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: prescriber and says, I want to try
cannabis and the prescriber says,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the key things that Helios,
but also all of the other companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: are providing medicinal cannabis in New
Zealand are doing is working with the
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all at a GP conference just two
weeks ago before jumping on planes and
[SPEAKER_00]: coming to Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that GP conference in Rotorua,
there was a two-hour plenary session
[SPEAKER_00]: around medicinal cannabis that was really
well attended.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is also, I guess, a pull from the
doctors and we are trying to fill that
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuum of information so that we can then
provide for more and more patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Peter, maybe you can talk a little bit
about the growth of the patient access and
[SPEAKER_03]: the market also in Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because even though your patients have to
deal with these draconian driving laws,
[SPEAKER_03]: your market is expanding and more and more
patients are getting access every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the data that came out earlier
this year, there have now been over a
[SPEAKER_01]: million approvals through the special
access scheme over the journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not a million patients,
but it is a sign that it is becoming
[SPEAKER_01]: mainstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got something like 30,000 doctors in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's around 4,000 to 5,000 of them that
are now actively prescribing under special
[SPEAKER_01]: access scheme and the authorised
prescriber scheme.
[SPEAKER_01]: The numbers, and I was talking to our
government people here today about getting
[SPEAKER_01]: some clarity and transparency around what
is happening with patient access and
[SPEAKER_01]: products to patients is something that
we're working on because at the moment it
[SPEAKER_01]: is difficult to pin down exactly what's
happening, but there's no doubt there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: push and a growth which is really
encouraging.
[SPEAKER_03]: And investing in physician education is
something that sometimes companies in the
[SPEAKER_03]: early stages have a hard time committing
to because it's an investment that rises
[SPEAKER_03]: the tide for all ships, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead of companies really focusing
on the same group of prescribers and
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to get their loyalty, the work to
convert new physicians into the space is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually what's going to touch more
patients in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and as an industry association,
that's a key role we're playing to do that
[SPEAKER_01]: because as an unregistered medicine,
it's illegal to do any sort of promotion
[SPEAKER_01]: or advertising and you can't do that at a
company or product specific level,
[SPEAKER_01]: but as an industry association,
we can absolutely bring it to the fore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you two have trade representatives from
your government here at this event and I
[SPEAKER_03]: was chatting with them both yesterday and
coming from Canada where our government is
[SPEAKER_03]: not interested in helping to grow our
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're definitely not interested in
helping us be successful in a global
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: How on earth did you navigate the
relationships with your governments where
[SPEAKER_03]: they are here at ICBC and chatting about
how much they love this industry and
[SPEAKER_03]: support your company?
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's like a miracle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to go first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Global Victoria have got a stand here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Victorian government and they
actually, the Victorian government,
[SPEAKER_01]: got the ball rolling in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the first to put legislation
into play, but then had to step back
[SPEAKER_01]: because as signatory to the UN single
convention, it had to be federally
[SPEAKER_01]: legislated and that's when the federal
government came in over the top and
[SPEAKER_01]: created the Office of Drug Control.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Victorian government have been
strongly involved the whole way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: They saw the opportunity and there's no
doubt we punch above our weight in our
[SPEAKER_01]: corner of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Australia and New Zealand,
but Melbourne and Victoria in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: have a really strong medical science
background as well and I think it came up
[SPEAKER_01]: the other day in the Global Investment
Forum that someone made the point that if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking to do clinical trial work,
Australia and Israel are the two key areas
[SPEAKER_01]: to focus on for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no doubt the next challenge for
us is to bring the science into the
[SPEAKER_01]: application of cannabinoids in human
health and we're at the forefront and with
[SPEAKER_01]: a really strong regulatory environment to
support it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that covers both Australia and New
Zealand and I think we've seen we're next
[SPEAKER_01]: to each other out in the hall and it's a
nice juxtaposition to have in terms of how
[SPEAKER_01]: we're working together as both government
bodies are talking to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really wonderful to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are 10 minutes out, so I'm going to
start hustling us through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a big question for you,
but I want you to try to give us a short
[SPEAKER_03]: answer to a brief question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have, we're going to kind of like
go from talking to Australia and New
[SPEAKER_03]: Zealand and kind of pull up and look at
the globe again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a very nuanced system for
assessing markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do really deep dives when you're
looking at new and emerging markets and I
[SPEAKER_03]: know that this is a big question because
we talked about it for about a half an
[SPEAKER_03]: hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: But can you take a couple of minutes and
just talk about all of the nuance factors
[SPEAKER_03]: that you look at when you're looking at
new markets?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure, and I think that what we've
been sharing here from our colleagues
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia and New Zealand is really
exemplifies the differences, some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: nuances.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at things when you walk
right back to the patient level.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can patients access the medicine in
that country?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many prescribers are there?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are the prescribers educated?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you look then at the actual provision
of the medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are people going to buy this from?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many outlets?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the availability?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we start off with doctors prescribing
education.
[SPEAKER_02]: We move through then to actually how the
medicine is going to get transferred or
[SPEAKER_02]: made available to the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of other factors to look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: The regulations obviously are very,
very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: The regulations can be, they're always
going to be fairly strict on the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis side because that's the way that
the system's set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are some countries, there are
more amenable or perhaps there's ways to
[SPEAKER_02]: navigate their regulations a little
differently than other countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So New Zealand earlier, it was very
strict.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a just GMP requirements and
there's not a lot of wiggle room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at other countries and sometimes
there are ways, even in Germany,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you look at the variability in the
states in Germany, people would prefer to
[SPEAKER_02]: import into certain states than other
states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's an ability to have a
little bit more of a certainty around just
[SPEAKER_02]: how strictly applied the regulations are
going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the end of the day,
you're looking at regulations that can be
[SPEAKER_02]: interpreted by people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oftentimes those interpretations can
vary a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be very strict or not so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in these markets, I'm also looking at
legacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, to me, the existence of,
virtually every country has a legacy
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is being grown in that country
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the legal markets tend to
be built upon.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Canada, the massive mistake that was
made was that the legacy market was
[SPEAKER_02]: rejected out of the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were left out completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have a lot of folks coming in to
try to make this work grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took Canada four or five years to
really get up to a decent quality and
[SPEAKER_02]: cadence with its cultivation, largely
because the legacy market was rejected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look at the legacy market.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is the jurisdiction approaching that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I look at the things I mentioned
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all the way through to the
import-export side of it, obviously supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chain is really, really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't believe all that you read.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the supply chain analysis is
exceptionally important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last thing I'll mention is I really
believe strongly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know everything at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learn every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I rely on experts in these various
narrow domains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I go to people that are smarter than me
with respect to the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or with prescribers or with clinics and
this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very, very important to focus on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot just think that you're going to
read and understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to go to the experts in those
narrow areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as a long-term legacy operator,
I certainly appreciate your respect for
[SPEAKER_03]: the wisdom and the experience from those
of us that have been in it for decades
[SPEAKER_03]: before regulation continuing to have a key
place in the new global industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I want to switch and talk about a
couple of my favourite subjects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to talk about social justice and
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering in both New Zealand and
Australia if there is conversation about
[SPEAKER_03]: how to include your indigenous populations
that were disproportionately punished by
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition and if they are on ramping
into the industry and if they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: reap some of the benefits of regulated
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so in New Zealand, I think we're
working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I go back to the beginning where
our regulations came in, I think there's
[SPEAKER_00]: some nice examples of where we've been
able to pave the way for those that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: have been disproportionately punished in
the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two things in New Zealand that are
really interesting around this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that we can transition illicit
genetics into the legal medicines market
[SPEAKER_00]: through a declaration process with our
Ministry of Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those legacy strains where people
have been accessing that often medicinally
[SPEAKER_00]: are able to come into a legal framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other point is really
something that was petitioned before my
[SPEAKER_00]: time, before I came into the industry,
but that the founders of the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: across the industry really pushed for was
around those with criminal charges being
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed into the industry or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know this was a contentious
discussion at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in New Zealand, those that have had
previous convictions for cannabis can work
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this opens the doors to
some people to be able to transition
[SPEAKER_00]: across.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen some examples of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're ready to move to New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter, can you add just very quickly,
because we're getting close to the end,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you want to comment anything about
on-ramping and including your indigenous
[SPEAKER_03]: populations in Australia?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should look at what they're
doing in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done it really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a big issue in Australia this
year with the referendum that's happening
[SPEAKER_01]: around the voice for indigenous people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, that's because they've
become politicized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping Australia doesn't miss the
opportunity to take the first step there,
[SPEAKER_01]: which should be to give them a voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my position, and I'll happily
put that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, no, there's still a lot more to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what about sustainability reporting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there conversations in your countries
about requirements for starting to report
[SPEAKER_03]: on your carbon footprint and your other
environmental KPIs?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a number of the research bodies
and universities involved in some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: work we're doing, I think that's going to
be a real focus for the next stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a long way to go on that,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's definitely high on the agenda in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just going to take one minute to
say that any of you that are operating in
[SPEAKER_03]: the EU, it would be good to have a look at
the corporate sustainability reporting
[SPEAKER_03]: disclosures that were passed in April,
because pretty much all small and
[SPEAKER_03]: medium-sized enterprises working in the
cannabis industry in Europe are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be required to be doing very significant
sustainability reporting in the next two
[SPEAKER_03]: years, including reporting on scope three,
which means the impact of your supply
[SPEAKER_03]: chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your partners are going to need to be
able to be doing their data collecting and
[SPEAKER_03]: their reporting.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that I've been
researching, and I'm super passionate
[SPEAKER_03]: about making sure that the folks in our
industry are waking up and getting
[SPEAKER_03]: prepared to do this kind of work,
because you don't want to be scrambling to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it in the last moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It becomes very complex and expensive to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're scrambling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to talk about
sustainability reporting, come and find
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last thing that I want to do is I just
want to give each one of you an
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity to essentially tell the
audience, like, why did you come to ICBC
[SPEAKER_03]: and what are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of the connections you're
trying to make, the partners that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to make, if you want to buy
something or sell something for the folks
[SPEAKER_03]: that are in the audience, who are the
people that you would like to come and
[SPEAKER_03]: talk to you when our panel is over?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I think for Australia,
with the recent changes to the
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation, people understanding that the
opportunity for medicinal cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_01]: global one, getting cannabinoids into
human health is the key focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the key message for
Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the pre-rec discussion around
what's happening in that flower space and
[SPEAKER_01]: moving too quickly to a recreational
market would really damage getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical work and the science done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the challenges we've got,
but we want to move the whole thing
[SPEAKER_01]: forward and having confidence in and not
undermining confidence is really a key
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being aware of what's happening in this
part of the world and vice versa is why
[SPEAKER_01]: we're here for ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carmen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we're at a B2B conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is a two way street in
terms of what we are asking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've found some great partners already
to bring our New Zealand grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: New Zealand made medicines to this side of
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are looking for a super high
quality medicine, then stop by the New
[SPEAKER_00]: Zealand booth, booth 383 and have a chat
to me or some of the other New Zealand
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for partnerships and
distribution pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part in terms of the two way
street in terms of what I'm looking for is
[SPEAKER_00]: as we are growing the industry quickly for
us at Aelius, we are looking for people
[SPEAKER_00]: who might want to come to New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a really tough sell to move to
New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hilary's coming already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can bring my dog, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bring your dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for people with EUGMP
experience and highly controlled indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grow or an extraction that might want to
come and spend six months or a year or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even longer in New Zealand and help
us to accelerate our industry so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can deliver more products to more patients
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we could show you a good time
in New Zealand and we could also learn
[SPEAKER_00]: from some people who've been there and
trod the path before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_03]: And David, let's talk about the services
that you offer and the partners that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're looking for here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, it's a B2B conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously we attend patient conferences
and the focus there is a bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is B2B, which is kind of my remarks
are mainly focused in that direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really recognize the lack of capital in
the market and that's what a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: are telling us, whether it's clients,
friends, associates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they're struggling to get access to
capital and in that environment you got to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a lot more creative, a lot more nimble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our work is based around navigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We help people to navigate access to
capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: We help people to navigate creative ways
to get their products into global markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of where we operate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at booth 345 and happy to talk with
a team of four people there and love to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to anyone that wants to come by.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been such a pleasure getting to know
the three of you as we prepared for this
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation and you're stuck with me for
life now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be lifelong friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to continuing to
collaborate and thank you for this
[SPEAKER_03]: fantastic conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
