[SPEAKER_00]: I do appreciate your company and that you
are joining me here for this very short
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say right up front, you need to
know my background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been in this industry for two
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I joined Brains Biaceutical two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to that, I was a pharmaceutical
executive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a senior vice president for a
biotech company called Biogen in the USA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I managed their neurology business,
about $7 billion worth of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then prior to that, I was the managing
director in the UK and Ireland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the same company, and I was also
the chairman of the industry group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked with the prime minister and
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the industry chair for the group to
try and bring about health care reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just played right into that in
terms of developing the science and also
[SPEAKER_00]: changing the political landscape for us to
make sure that patients get access to
[SPEAKER_00]: these incredible treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to do is to just start.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who don't know Brains
Biaceutical, we are an evidence-based and
[SPEAKER_00]: a science-led company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, that is quite critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing my background, you're now not
surprised by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are an API producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big parts of our business is we
produce API.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that we want to
make sure that scientific studies are not
[SPEAKER_00]: compromised because of inconsistency
within the API or that they meet the
[SPEAKER_00]: criteria that is required for a clinical
study, which is genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to have a DMF and all of
those type of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so important because I get
saddened, and I'm sure some of you will be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to relate to this, how many failed
studies are emerging at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's failing not because the drugs
don't work, not because cannabis or the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids don't have a role to play in
treating some of these diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's failing because the studies are
poorly designed or because we haven't done
[SPEAKER_00]: double randomized placebo-controlled
studies so people can compare what the
[SPEAKER_00]: true benefit is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited about this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: As somebody in this industry, I've
researched the data before coming into the
[SPEAKER_00]: sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for welcoming me in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see over and over again,
these are two landmark studies that were
[SPEAKER_00]: done in reviews, and one by the NIH in the
USA and the other one here in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the conclusion was the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could learn how to modulate the
endocannabinoid system, we could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially find solutions for every major
disease that humans are facing at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that we're starting to see
is that there is the emergence of really
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting new targets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tend to think of cannabis or
cannabinoids in the realm of CB1 and CB2
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also really excited about the fact
that it works on other pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that important?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at migraine, for example,
we know that CBD works on your CB
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors, but it also works on your
calcitonin-gene-related peptide pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's where all your tryptans work
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have something that works on two
major pathways, potentially you could have
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is more beneficial than
what is currently available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could have something for those that
aren't responding to tryptans that could
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit from cannabis-based or
cannabinoid-based treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the reality is there's only three
approved drugs on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of activity in this space,
you know, clinicaltrial.gov, there's over
[SPEAKER_00]: a thousand clinical studies there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we as an industry need to
potentially do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that a lot of you are in the
area of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, medical cannabis at the
moment, my home country, which is the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at the moment, only about 1% of
patients that could benefit from medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or cannabinoid-type treatments
are getting access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why it is so difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've got to be a specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single country is different,
but there's still a lot of hurdles that
[SPEAKER_00]: one has to go through in order to give
patients access to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're serious about giving patients
access to it, then, you know, insanity
[SPEAKER_00]: tells me that doing the same thing but
expecting a different result is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're trying a new path at
Brains Biocertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what we're trying to do is
to really look at drug development.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've come from, as I said,
from a pharmaceutical background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can't change the rules,
play by the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I sort of say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are looking at all elements of due
diligence in terms of developing products
[SPEAKER_00]: for this market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, starting with good API,
as I said, you've got to show something
[SPEAKER_00]: that any treatment that you bring to the
market has to be better than the current
[SPEAKER_00]: standard of care.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you're comparing yourself
to a genericized market, it most probably
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't going to be worth the investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to formulate it because patents
are so important in the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people are going to invest millions
into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then design the studies properly so
that you can have measurable outcomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: measurable endpoints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not an advertisement for Brains,
but just the lengths that we need to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to pursue this path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the very first thing is you've got to
make sure that you meet all the specs of
[SPEAKER_00]: RCHQ7.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that as an example,
our CBD, 98 to 102, the impurity levels
[SPEAKER_00]: are less than 0.15 THC is undetectable,
0.000000.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be compliant with RCHQ7.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be compliant with the German
Pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have stability data,
toxicology data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all of that, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And over and above that, you've got to
walk the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to do the studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to have, we've got a drug
master file.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also got an R&D element.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at THC Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at CBN and CBGY because that
review paper that I showed you,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where the science is going at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the cannabinoids that scientists
and researchers are looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of where the industry is
going is potentially being able to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: different cannabinoids together and to
formulate them in a way so we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD together with CBN is better than any
of those two agents on their own for
[SPEAKER_00]: things like anxiety and insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to combine them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take the isolates, combine them,
and reformulate them is a key step in
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just enlarged our facility so that
no surprise, our facility is the old FASA
[SPEAKER_00]: facility in the UK in Sandwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, the pharmaceutical
connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just enlarged it to make sure that
we can meet demand for both today and
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow because so many studies,
as they progress into phase three and the
[SPEAKER_00]: volumes increase, people can't meet those
increased in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to make sure we were ready
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we are in partnership with DSM
Femini, which is a world leader
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical company in the area of
formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why that is important is we know that
cannabinoids are broken down with your
[SPEAKER_00]: first pass metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the bioavailability of cannabinoids
is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to make sure that we can
formulate these drugs in different ways
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can increase the loading,
increase the stability, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the bioavailability So we're
doing that together with our partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next step is for us to make
sure that we do the clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to leave you with this
one little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of our partners that we are
supporting in Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a study that's pre-clin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please be aware that it is
pre-clinical, not clinical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this excites me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the leading causes of
death if you've got cancer, melanoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one is in lung cancer,
in the top three causes of death if you
[SPEAKER_00]: get these forms of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that CVD, this is in a
nanoformulation, has been shown to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: tumors in this cancer, as well as prolong
life, is incredibly exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are powerful therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm absolutely privileged to be part
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I love that law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for me, it's all about that we
leave the world in a better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That because of our presence, that we're
making things better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even once we've moved on into other
things, that that impact lasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the speakers said,
you guys are changing the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are game changers, history
makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really grateful to be part of this
group as we go and navigate and ponder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come near this new area and make a
difference in the world, particularly for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, do we do acid forms?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do we do them in a formulation that is
stabilized?
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, the research is really
excited around some of the acid forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this current stage, we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would I like to get into that area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you raise a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I would love to see is rather
than the football analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, for those of you when my
kids were younger, it used to be so much
[SPEAKER_00]: fun watching them play football or soccer
or whatever, because they would all run
[SPEAKER_00]: after the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's played in position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody ran after the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we as an industry have to get
better at not all running after the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same ball, but complementing each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't do acid forms, but potentially
somebody out there does do acid forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's work together rather than us all
chasing the same ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: But great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Bo Whitney, Whitney Economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the United States, the largest
contributor to anti-cannabis reform
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation is Big Pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently spoke at the Parliament in
Ireland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge pharma presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical program is fledgling because
of the influence of Big Pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: One question is, why is Big Pharma so
afraid of, and we all know this question,
[SPEAKER_01]: why is it so afraid of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: But how can the cannabis industry kind of
work with Big Pharma to develop stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: parallel rather than being assumed to be a
threat to the Big Pharma industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to answer that question in
the next 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what the short answer is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Pharma want to know two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe?
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, show me the evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's exactly what I was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can maybe get into it in a little
bit more detail in the panel conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think at the moment, rather than
doing signaling studies or proof of
[SPEAKER_00]: concept studies or trying to do real world
evidence, pharma doesn't get engaged on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get engaged when you've got a solid
pre-clin or phase one, phase two clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: study.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evidence is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shown to have a benefit of a placebo
or over current form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for me, I'm very comfortable
with the fact that people need access to
[SPEAKER_00]: these methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where the medical
cannabis is playing a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we want to engage pharma and a
broader populace of our patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: then some of us have to start going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it takes about 10 years from
molecule development through to an MA,
[SPEAKER_00]: a marketing authorization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would say is we don't have to
start even at drug discovery anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's so much evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody asked me today, they said,
Terry, what do you think of real world
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said to them, real world evidence in
my old world never replaces a pivotal
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no clinical study should start without
real world evidence because you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize as much risk as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's complementary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think big pharma will get involved
when we start to do the studies that show
[SPEAKER_00]: them that these are powerful therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their pipelines are drying up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they're waiting for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an industry to up our game and do
some of these studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time for Terry O'Regan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
