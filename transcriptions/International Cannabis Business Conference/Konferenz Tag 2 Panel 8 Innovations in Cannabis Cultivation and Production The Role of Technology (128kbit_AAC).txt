[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody, for joining today.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the introducer said, my name is Atiyah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to let the panel introduce
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll start off with Sonny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Sonny, managing partner of cultivators
out of the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: We help the growers and investors from
business ID towards cultivation and
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation support.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in short what we do.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Lucas Targos.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am the VP of controlled environment ag
at Urban Grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: I formerly was a commercial vegetable
grower, turned to cannabis grower,
[SPEAKER_09]: and now have worked for Urban Grow for
about eight years.
[SPEAKER_09]: We really specialize in full design build
projects, specifically on cultivation
[SPEAKER_09]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Sabrina Carvalho.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am the cannabis specialist
developing R&D for Philips Lighting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Darren Kaplan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a senior consultant for sustainability
at Sanzaglobal.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a consulting company that focuses on
the design and operation of cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: facilities around the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're based in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my background's in academia and also a
grower, so kind of both the science and
[SPEAKER_06]: the practical aspect of growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Timo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the general manager of Fluence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fluence is a horticultural lighting
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are all happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Timo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chatting about innovations in cannabis
cultivation is obviously a very large
[SPEAKER_01]: topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to kind of start off talking
with the very early phases of development,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is propagation and tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll start off with, what are some of
the major advancements that you've seen,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe in the last year or so, in that
field of both sourcing fantastic genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: and the technologies that we can use to
ensure that we have a great start to the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe I give it a start.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladies first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of the advances that actually we
ourselves worked on is on recipes
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically used for propagation and
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So currently, we have rolled out the
recipes of LEDs specific to improve
[SPEAKER_04]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We managed to improve propagation in all
aspects of it, from speeding when it's
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult, from situations like Germany,
where you cannot use rooting hormones.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: We created recipes for that that growers
can use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we find that we are, well,
at least that one we are very proud of
[SPEAKER_04]: bringing to the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: But genetics, indeed, also very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Working with breathers is very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having bad genetics for rooting can kill
your business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, choose wisely if you go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I would say it's also very
important.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: On my side, I would say that we're seeing
a lot more of desire to have tissue
[SPEAKER_09]: culture labs and practices within the
facilities on these early stages.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely become an evolution.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot more standards around tissue
culture for cannabis specifically,
[SPEAKER_09]: which I think it's very good.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, as most people know,
there's certain viruses that are kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: working their way through the industry
right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And tissue culture provides a very helpful
safety net in that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that whether it's a retrofit or
you're looking at building your first
[SPEAKER_09]: facility, allocating that space to some
sort of tissue culture ability,
[SPEAKER_09]: tissue culture lab, can de-risk a lot
within the facility and then also provide
[SPEAKER_09]: that genetic security there as well,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe in addition, that you also have
the possibility to have the backup at
[SPEAKER_05]: another location.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from a business model, it makes you a
little bit more resilient.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have a problem that you have
maybe somewhere backup, so I think that
[SPEAKER_05]: makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you outsource it, what a lot of
people try to do is the risk for getting
[SPEAKER_02]: something in from the supply you buy it
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is, for me, always a risk factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have it on your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can really preserve that things go
wrong, like getting an attempt to offer it
[SPEAKER_02]: in, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a way, tissue culture, nowadays,
when I talk to growers, many of us,
[SPEAKER_04]: we create varieties that we love.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are unique to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we find that that is amazing variety
that I manage to create, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tissue culture, to me, for this type of
love for a specific variety, for whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: reason you like it, is your safety net.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have it now and in 10 years from
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can always go back to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I find that at least for even from the
most unique varieties to scale up
[SPEAKER_04]: production, tissue culture has its place
for this aspect of innovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can always go back to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of the growers that we talk to,
they actually say, oh, the variety that I
[SPEAKER_04]: had or that somebody had and that we lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tissue culture will, even in the future,
can you imagine having a library of a
[SPEAKER_04]: collection of breeds that 100 years ago
somebody used and we can still look at it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's becoming more and more important
this past couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very much, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned the virus, the hoplain
viroid is probably one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_06]: concerns with cannabis growers right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Canada specifically, it's maybe 90%
of the facilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard numbers around there are
infected.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once your genetics are infected,
if your mother's stock is infected,
[SPEAKER_06]: there might not even be a way of getting
rid of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So having tissue culture reserves is kind
of one of your only ways of really
[SPEAKER_06]: securing your genetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe tissue culture is the only way
to rid the facility of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a very scary virus too,
because it's, from what we're seeing right
[SPEAKER_09]: now, stable even in water, which is... And
even traditional tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you're doing nodal culture,
it's not effective.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need to be doing mirror stem
culture, which takes a long time and it
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't always work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So starting with clean stock.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's less of a fear tactic and
more of a reality check.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Backups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, when we started seeing tissue
culture in Canada in 2018, I worked at one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the earliest tissue culture facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just an internal lab for ourselves,
but it was very hot and heavy at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone was very interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everyone got a little bit less
excited about it because it's not a fully
[SPEAKER_01]: proven method.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not cookie cutter, cop and paste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't just take my protocols and use
them for the 700 cultivars you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it requires a lot of time, effort and
expertise, which is something that was not
[SPEAKER_01]: as readily available in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that you can just pump
a couple hundred thousand dollars into and
[SPEAKER_01]: be for sure guaranteed all of the
cultivars are gonna work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really interesting for me to see
in the last year or two is kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: rise of tissue culture again, because it's
become an absolute necessity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using a continual mother clone system
indefinitely with no backup and having
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis grown at a commercial level where
it's never been grown before and hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: been bred specifically for resistances to
a variety of pests and viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that it's something that everyone
should be looking at in their cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy if you're not, it's very risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Sabrina said, you could breed
something for a very long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: have a fantastic genetic and then lose it
in the matter of a few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a really big area that
I'm glad to see Europe actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel has been more on the forefront of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are very few European clients that I
have that have not already begun their
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy with tissue culture either
internally or looking for somebody to
[SPEAKER_01]: source it and do it externally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's been a really big
improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along the lines of kind of moving past our
tissue culture and propagation,
[SPEAKER_01]: phase, moving into kind of cultivation,
a mix of both veg and flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of questions there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One I wanted to start off with is
environmental sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we all know, cannabis is bashed very
often for not being the most
[SPEAKER_01]: environmentally sustainable industry,
especially when you're doing indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, which is predominantly what I
work in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very power heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those of us in Europe who have felt
the increase in power prices in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: year, we can really attest to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to know what, if anyone has
seen anything very interesting along the
[SPEAKER_01]: lines of more environmental
sustainability, in basically any of your
[SPEAKER_01]: flower cultivation projects?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that Sonia at least can also
say that yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's put it this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know a lot about other regions,
but in European Union, you have two
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is the rules of a country and then the
rules of European Union.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know that European Union will
become more strict on how much energy we
[SPEAKER_04]: can spend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether we like it or not, we need to be
sustainable growing our crops independent
[SPEAKER_04]: of what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Netherlands, for example, is already
starting to apply that and planning to
[SPEAKER_04]: apply it even more fiercely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are talking about situations where
they say we will only support with
[SPEAKER_04]: subsidies or discounts or whatever else if
you fulfill this energy gap.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go over it, you will not be
supported.
[SPEAKER_04]: You will not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And can you imagine, everybody here is
going to kill me for that, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomato right now, high, high crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Netherlands is putting sustainable
measures of if you want to be supported,
[SPEAKER_04]: you will need to be within this energy
gap.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every single grower that has been
doing this for years is asking how do we
[SPEAKER_04]: even hit this target?
[SPEAKER_04]: If they would put anywhere near to that
target, to cannabis right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: we would be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we all need to start thinking of our
projects of how can we make it more
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainable in numbers, not even for
spending less money of ours, but
[SPEAKER_04]: accounting already that if you're going to
do that in Europe, you will have these
[SPEAKER_04]: coming sooner or later.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we better prepare to how low can we go
with our energies and so on to get a good
[SPEAKER_04]: crop, a balanced crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we do together to lower it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they will come.
[SPEAKER_04]: These rules will come.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for us, if we can get on the front
line of saying we know how low we can get
[SPEAKER_04]: and European Union can say, OK,
hopefully soon they will say we will
[SPEAKER_04]: listen and we will consider those.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can have that influence,
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: European Union will always come with rules
on that, sooner or later.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not only the energy, it's also
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in Netherlands, we already have an
horticultural world, the zero emission law
[SPEAKER_02]: by 2027.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from that moment, growers cannot
discharge any water anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the water they are using and coming
back from drain, they need to disinfect
[SPEAKER_02]: and reuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not only the energy part where you
guys with Fluence and Philips work on and
[SPEAKER_02]: reducing the energy costs, it is also all
the other resources we use to grow our
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not really a common practice for
cannabis growers to recirculate.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's complicated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also with the way that cannabis
growers have learned to grow with specific
[SPEAKER_06]: brands of fertilizer and products,
if you're recirculating your nutrient
[SPEAKER_06]: solution, you have to readjust specific
elements.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not an easy thing to do if you
don't understand each component of your
[SPEAKER_06]: fertilizer that you're using.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's a lot of learning and a
lot of learning from what's happening in
[SPEAKER_06]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the Netherlands, because it's been
happening for a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we work on the wastewater management
side a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's been a long road.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the biggest difficulty is that
in a lot of cannabis fertilizer regimens,
[SPEAKER_09]: you see two things that are very difficult
from a recirculation is high heavy metals
[SPEAKER_09]: and a lot of organic materials,
which make UV not as effective to get the
[SPEAKER_09]: transmission through.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've had to really play around with a
lot of different technologies.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mainly, I would say, the one that is
really making moves through the entire
[SPEAKER_09]: horticulture industry is ozone as a very
well way of disinfecting water.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we also talk about a lot on the
condensate recapture as well too.
[SPEAKER_09]: So recapturing all the condensate that's
being produced from the HVAC from the
[SPEAKER_09]: facility and utilizing some pretty simple
ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: Believe it or not, that is very clean
water.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's so clean, it's too clean.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's easy to end up getting biological
growth within there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's something that I think is going to
be a large part of the evolution of the
[SPEAKER_09]: industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because as you mentioned with the
recirculating system, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: commercial horticultural practices that
need to be taken place in order to have
[SPEAKER_09]: those systems operate properly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say that we've been able to kind of
make a hybrid and a lot of times bring in
[SPEAKER_09]: more of a blending system to where we're
actually blending that recirculation with
[SPEAKER_09]: a direct inject system to allow us to kind
of have a happy medium.
[SPEAKER_09]: Center closed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: To add on that, I think that, for example,
nowadays, cannabis growers focus indeed on
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding to specific niche choices of
looks, smells, and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that the true innovation will
come when we mix that with efficiency,
[SPEAKER_04]: choosing the varieties that also bring the
efficiency into account.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can have really nice varieties,
but we have to have the notion that they
[SPEAKER_04]: are very expensive to run.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am from light, but we have clients
asking us to actually increase light to a
[SPEAKER_04]: light level to achieve a yield that they
want with this particular variety,
[SPEAKER_04]: while we prefer to actually look at it and
ask, can we breed something similar but
[SPEAKER_04]: that operates at a reasonable level?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we can't keep going higher and
higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even biologically, these plants cannot
take everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are amazing plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are very flexible, but they cannot
take everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that also clients of
ours and of all of us are suffering from
[SPEAKER_04]: is that technology is advancing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of these breeds, they were bred for
sunlight, for HPS, for whatever it was
[SPEAKER_04]: being used in each region, and LEDs are a
technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a technology that pushes these plants
much harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unique, but breeds need to keep up
with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have technology sometimes that,
for us, is innovative, but is waiting for
[SPEAKER_04]: the other innovations to come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Breeding is one of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: We only now are not starting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether we like it or not, for this
capacity and scale up, we only now are
[SPEAKER_04]: starting on the efficiency of having good
crops that can handle a reasonable level.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that breeding will change a lot
of the techniques and will help a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: the technologies that we have and that we
are developing work better as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, working with breeders is
important on that as well, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a comment, Lucas, you mentioned
about heavy metals, that that can be also
[SPEAKER_02]: a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that also starts with making the
right choices for your starting water,
[SPEAKER_02]: your fertilizers, so use high quality
brands for fertilizers and for substrate
[SPEAKER_02]: so that you don't get it into a system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I agree, if you have it,
then it's difficult to get out of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, and I think there's been,
luckily, there's been definitely a
[SPEAKER_09]: movement around from where we were back in
the day of shelf, bought liquid
[SPEAKER_09]: fertilizers that are extremely expensive,
not that I'm bashing on them, but there's
[SPEAKER_09]: a better route, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And you get better quality, better
consistency.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you'll see that both in the product,
but also in your systems, just in everyday
[SPEAKER_09]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and so from facility design,
that's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you are designing your cannabis
facility, I think everyone knows in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, it's really important to be
flexible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important to understand,
even if you're in an emerging market,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are more developed markets,
Canada being an example, certain countries
[SPEAKER_01]: in Europe, where you can look at the
lessons learned and make sure that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have the ability to pivot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I always encourage my clients
to do, have the ability to be flexible and
[SPEAKER_01]: malleable as the market progresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with your facility design,
I have a client and they did direct water
[SPEAKER_01]: to waste because they said their water was
really cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, it's not about just the price
of the water that you make these
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the guiding force.
[SPEAKER_01]: And surprise, surprise, the government has
now said that they cannot put all of their
[SPEAKER_01]: water into waste, but we don't have any
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: To put a recirculating system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of the fun little
challenges, but it's really important to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with really experienced developers
for facilities that will tell you your
[SPEAKER_01]: options and let you know why you should do
these things and why you should have these
[SPEAKER_01]: options available.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not only water and power, we were just
talking about the things you actually put
[SPEAKER_01]: into your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis is very garbage in,
garbage out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't use good quality lights,
if you don't use good quality substrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers, et cetera, you don't get,
I would say, the robustness of that
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really not doing yourself any
favors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not getting the full capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's also been a lot of questions
regarding substrates in particular and the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment sustainability of things like
rockwool and coco peat and things along
[SPEAKER_01]: those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have you had a lot of clients or any
projects you've been working on where you
[SPEAKER_01]: found that you're kind of battling with
them about making the more sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: choice for their own kind of betterment in
the long term, but they're kind of maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: hung up on a practice they've had
previously and not really willing to let
[SPEAKER_01]: it go?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine out of 10.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think cannabis is pretty good on the,
let's say that for cocoa, for example,
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of cannabis growers are pushing for
cocoa ahead of really having to make those
[SPEAKER_06]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of rockwool growers still,
but compared to let's say other crops,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there are a lot of progressive
thinking cannabis growers that really do
[SPEAKER_06]: want to push the sustainability.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the substrate is usually the first
thing that they'll go with LEDs and the
[SPEAKER_06]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to say that the struggle is
not the material you're using.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many materials that are a certain scale,
one substrate that you're using can be the
[SPEAKER_04]: best substrate you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're moving to scale up or if
you're moving to a different way of
[SPEAKER_04]: growing, if you're applying a different
technology and with that technology you
[SPEAKER_04]: could have the problem that that substrate
is no longer the best solution for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to understand is that many of us,
whether we are doing for recreational
[SPEAKER_04]: small scale, recreational bigger scale,
medicinal, this and that, clubs and so on,
[SPEAKER_04]: there are products that work very well now
for a particular system that having this
[SPEAKER_04]: project insisting that they will continue
with that product towards the other
[SPEAKER_04]: system, and we can't change that.
[SPEAKER_04]: My lights cannot fix the choice of you
choosing to go with that particular
[SPEAKER_04]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not fair to the substrate,
it's not fair to the lights, or it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: fair to the irrigation system you chose.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to be very careful with the
choices we do, with the combinations we
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, if you would come to me and I
would say with my lights, I know from
[SPEAKER_04]: experience with other clients that we had
that they are applying this same method,
[SPEAKER_04]: they have a hard time with it,
you would please consider something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can even tell you, well, you can talk
to this person, that person, that person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, we can't fix that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is literally that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And many of these innovations,
they work on the right place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of these innovations are coming,
they work for their place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't try to push it to work everywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a place for a reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many of these I believe that it's more
about the balance of where they work best,
[SPEAKER_04]: not that they are wrong or that they don't
work at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you look to substrates,
we all know that we can grow in all type
[SPEAKER_02]: of substrates, but clearly in the
medicinal market in Europe, you see a
[SPEAKER_02]: movement and a trend towards stone wool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's clean and inert and you start
uniform, and that is always more difficult
[SPEAKER_02]: if you grow in soil or cocopeat because
it's the mixture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having from one pot to another pot
exact the same is more difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just logical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So therefore you see a movement for clean,
inert product with stone wool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Timo, you also see that every
year, like in June, they were talking even
[SPEAKER_02]: for the three medicinal license holders.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way is stone wool because of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So because it's mainly a medical market,
obviously the product quality and
[SPEAKER_05]: stability is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with rock wool, you have a clean
starting point, but still the rock wool
[SPEAKER_05]: issue is an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we do afterwards?
[SPEAKER_05]: That is, you brought it up at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: The question was about sustainability.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a question unanswered.
[SPEAKER_05]: We answer one question, save product for
the patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't answer the question what to do
with the waste product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have in the Netherlands, but that's
only in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not going to transport,
if you grow in Germany, all your stone
[SPEAKER_02]: wool and product to the Netherlands for
that recycling solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's also a matter of having sufficient
volume where all the growers are to have
[SPEAKER_02]: this in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're right, that is at this moment a
tricky point.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that's also an opportunity for
people to see that there's gaps within
[SPEAKER_09]: recycling programs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a big use for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So those markets that need them,
it's a great area to look into.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are entitled, if you are working now
or even if you're developing a project,
[SPEAKER_04]: you are entitled to ask every single
company, what is your disposal techniques,
[SPEAKER_04]: protocols, do you have it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you receive it back?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the recycling program?
[SPEAKER_04]: All of that, just ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs to fit into your guidelines.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to get rid of it, if it is
circular economy or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of cocoa developments.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are improving a lot and developing a
lot as well, because exactly that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are challenged.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to keep up with the techniques,
even for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see a lot of these substrates,
irrigation systems, improving a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I find that more often than not,
if you ask companies that are doing this
[SPEAKER_04]: job and that they are working fiercely to
improve, they will give you an answer of
[SPEAKER_04]: where they are in that stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will have no problems addressing the
fact that they will say, in your region we
[SPEAKER_04]: have no capacity to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have in your region someone that is
capable of doing that now, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes even the companies take it
as, is it a good challenge?
[SPEAKER_04]: Challenge the companies to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ask them to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the times they will be honest
enough to say, well, it will take us a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of years, but we accept the fact
that this is a new challenge for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we even are the ones telling
exactly, please be prepared, because we
[SPEAKER_04]: foresee that in the next three years
something is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you cannot prepare for that,
then we can't do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So ask, talk, interact.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't like the answer, just say it,
that you didn't like that and that you
[SPEAKER_04]: want something better.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are all working for improving,
even in our own innovations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I have an idea that I think is
great, and everybody looks at me,
[SPEAKER_04]: that is great but expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, okay, I need to make it
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, how to fix that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We like the challenges, because if we
don't talk and interact, we don't make it
[SPEAKER_04]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we touched on something
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is that to do medical grade cannabis
is not the most sustainable practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the most sustainable way to grow
cannabis is to put it in a field outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you have this large level of
variability between the crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you're not really meeting that
tolerance limit you want for your C of
[SPEAKER_01]: A's.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like growing in Rockwell, for many of
my clients, because it's inert,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's clean, because it's something
that we can get consistent C of A's on and
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that it's always the same every
single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a bigger conversation that I
think the European Union needs to discuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want sustainable practices,
but you also want super consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are we going to find ways to meet
in the middle, or how are we going to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with different companies in the space to
make more improvements along those lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we all want to be more
sustainable, but we also have to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: these very strict requirements that you
have for our cultivation and production.
[SPEAKER_01]: One area I'm seeing a lot of really cool
innovations in, which is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting area for me, we spend so much
time in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for me, post-harvest is always
very fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I always tell people, you can
spend 10 to 12 weeks on a crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can ruin it in a matter of days in
a dry room by having a mold overgrowth or
[SPEAKER_01]: something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's been a really big area of
innovation, and I'll pass it over to the
[SPEAKER_01]: panel as well to discuss a little bit
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one point I wanted to touch on was
microbial remediation, which is a very hot
[SPEAKER_01]: topic, because coming from Canada,
we use pretty much irradiation and
[SPEAKER_01]: e-beaming for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you guys don't really have as many
options here, and there's not as many
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Europe's not a single country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that you can easily
move the product between borders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been seeing a lot of things on the
floor and some private conversations,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I wanted to know what your best guess
is for the next big wave of microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: remediation technology in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming from Canada, as many people know,
is very strict in terms of microbial
[SPEAKER_06]: standards and thresholds.
[SPEAKER_06]: First off, it's definitely possible not to
have to remediate, which is even meeting
[SPEAKER_06]: those strict thresholds.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're growing, let's say you're using
an inert media, you have a very highly
[SPEAKER_06]: controlled environment with good air
filtration, you have sanitary practices.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you do all those things, it's very
possible, and you can do it consistently
[SPEAKER_06]: not having to remediate, which there are
so many remediation methods out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not even familiar with all of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's probably new ones that you guys
know that I haven't heard of.
[SPEAKER_06]: But e-beam, for example, or radiation,
it has an effect whether or not it's huge
[SPEAKER_06]: on product quality, and it also has some
stigma associated with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's radiation going into the product,
so some buyers don't like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or some consumers might not like that
idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's possible to avoid it
altogether with just the proper practices.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd like to hear more about what's out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I think is really important,
because in cultivation we often talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: climate.
[SPEAKER_05]: This discussion is sometimes not so
happening in the drying phase.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like if you talk about microclimates
and so on, is it really understood how
[SPEAKER_05]: vertically my temperature, humidity,
et cetera, it's not really.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also not measured, so the sensors
are partly not installed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, as you said in the question,
there is so much potential to make it
[SPEAKER_05]: right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So give it the time it needs, have it
under control.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there you not necessarily need
really high tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need just sensors, dashboard,
look at it, something out of balance,
[SPEAKER_05]: correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it can be pretty easy as well,
but have it under control.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we always know relatively high
drying rooms, and if you go through the
[SPEAKER_05]: room, you feel already the differences.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we feel it already, then it's an
issue for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think I would agree with that is that
I think there's a lot of different tools
[SPEAKER_09]: from a technology standpoint for reducing
microbials.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think really what it comes down to
is your climate, your environment within
[SPEAKER_09]: that room.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think there's a disconnect that we
see right now in terms of people's
[SPEAKER_09]: strategy around sequencing of climate set
points.
[SPEAKER_09]: Within those dry rooms during the drying
period.
[SPEAKER_09]: Personally, I can't speak for everyone,
but for myself, what I've seen the most
[SPEAKER_09]: success in is touching the plant as least
as possible during that harvesting into
[SPEAKER_09]: the dry room phase.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you need to be very strategic in
terms of your climate within that room
[SPEAKER_09]: during really the first three to four days
are the most critical.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a big misconception around
moisture content and water activity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those are two very, very important
things.
[SPEAKER_09]: They come from really the food industry
around drying foods and microbials and
[SPEAKER_09]: foods.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they hold very, very true to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what I would say that is the
biggest.
[SPEAKER_09]: The two biggest things is focusing on
climate sequencing on those first three to
[SPEAKER_09]: four days within the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: How much moisture you're ripping out of
that product, having the least amount of
[SPEAKER_09]: touches on it, and then understanding the
water activity.
[SPEAKER_09]: How does water actually move within this
product during that drying phase?
[SPEAKER_04]: To add to that, I think that even we don't
breed for post-harvest, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it was fascinating when I started
in cannabis and suddenly it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, let's harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started seeing the methods of hang
dry, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: This plant is not uniform at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have small flowers, big flowers,
even bigger flowers all hanging on the
[SPEAKER_04]: same plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants on top of plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen methods of people even pushing
plants on top of plants to dry them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just all of this is a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the basic techniques is a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for me, in an innovation,
is really asking these questions of how
[SPEAKER_04]: can...
[SPEAKER_04]: For this type of methods, what are the
best plants to do with this method?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a crop where you have this
discrepancy of flowers, you will always
[SPEAKER_04]: have problems, no matter how even good
your climate is probably, because some of
[SPEAKER_04]: these flowers are already dry and the
other ones are still with moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, for example, I work with plants for
years and I find cannabis, a post-harvest
[SPEAKER_04]: like that, very challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: With all the techniques of not touching
and so on, just the unique aspect of dry
[SPEAKER_04]: hanging is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is actually a challenge that I
find very specific to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in many fruits and in many
vegetables, you actually chop it apart or
[SPEAKER_04]: you put the fruits separate and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And suddenly, in many aspects of it,
cannabis doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for that aspect is unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: I find that this challenge to how can we
improve on this for this particular method
[SPEAKER_04]: is something that not that many people are
looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's very unique to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I find it a very interesting
challenge, but also not the cheapest one
[SPEAKER_04]: to go at this point, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Research and development in cannabis is
expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look to the drying methods,
it's also depending on what market are you
[SPEAKER_02]: serving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going for dry flower or is your
market extract?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it becomes a complete different
ballgame, of course, and you know all
[SPEAKER_02]: about it, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what is really interesting
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So coming from agriculture, previously,
and one of the jobs I had before I started
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting, I managed a one million square
foot cannabis greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very unique situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your 36,000 plant harvests, your 2,500
kilos pumping through a post-harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: process in six days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very difficult for you to,
you know, we were partially owned by a
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable grower, a very large one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always remember him really focusing
on cultivation being the most important
[SPEAKER_01]: part of this process because that's what
they're used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their post-harvest is pull it down,
wash it, and put it into a container.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they weren't understanding why we had
to have so much labor and so much time in
[SPEAKER_01]: this part and that, you know, if I was
actually strapped for labor during COVID,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was putting them more in post-harvest
than in cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, missing a small step in
cultivation was way better than having a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of product that couldn't dry down
because we couldn't bring it down in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're able to take a lot of innovations
from, you know, the agriculture industry
[SPEAKER_01]: for cultivation, but not so many for
post-harvest because it's so unique to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabis product itself is really
heavily reliant upon standards that were
[SPEAKER_01]: set in the legacy market as to what is
considered a good bud or top cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Explaining to pharmaceutical auditors that
the bigger buds are more desirable even
[SPEAKER_01]: though they have the same trichome density
and effect as the smaller buds is a very
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated thing to explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's because regardless of the fact
that we're a medical market, we come from
[SPEAKER_01]: a very long-standing legacy market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody for all your
contributions today and the great panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to leave the last couple of
minutes in case anybody has any questions
[SPEAKER_01]: for anyone on the panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it again for Tia and everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: Michael's running like he sees someone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Rocky Petrullo with the Colombian
Grow operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tissue culture, you talked about
earlier, we're trying to utilize that in
[SPEAKER_03]: our farm in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a question that I've had for a
while is that the DEA came out with the
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds don't have THC so you can mail them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you mail a plantlet in a test tube
across borders, across countries?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that possible?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to depend on the regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to send it to the Netherlands,
no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tissue is a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: A seed, bear with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: A seed is not a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The moment it has a tissue out of that
seed is a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tissue culture is a plant in the
Netherlands, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be very diligent on checking the
regulations of the country because some
[SPEAKER_04]: countries might not consider tissue
culture a plant and others will.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that plant crosses all of those
borders, it will be stuck on the country
[SPEAKER_04]: that actually considers that a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So be very, very careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter that it doesn't have any
THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, speaking for the Dutch that I
find unique on that sense, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: matter the THC level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is a plant, cannabis tissue, is a plant,
therefore, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know in other countries if these
rules function the same as in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Netherlands?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it depends on the... It depends on
the country.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just send it to my house.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a citizen of the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've taught them everything,
apparently.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it for Michael Knott walking
all the stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Christina.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a cannabis educator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were speaking about sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was wondering if you could comment on
growing in living soil and using
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizal inoculants for plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that would probably introduce more
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to hear your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ironically enough, my background is
actually in regenerative ag.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was very much a hippie in my
upbringing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the difficulty that I see both even
coming from regenerative ag into the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis industry is scalability.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that living soil is really... It's
a great solution to a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is very tough to make it feasible
at scale, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think there's some hybrid systems
that we can find within there that can
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of meet that goal.
[SPEAKER_09]: But living soil at its foundation,
there's so many benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just at a commercial scale, it's very
difficult to make feasible.
[SPEAKER_04]: To add on that, the plants have plant soil
feedbacks.
[SPEAKER_04]: They communicate top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scientifically, that is a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's denying that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we use rock walls, cocos, neutral
systems for scalability.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nowadays, innovation is coming into that
aspect of testing even from the root side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only, for example, we have all
biological control protocols that exist
[SPEAKER_04]: that function really, really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of these are techniques of animals
and fungi and insects that actually are
[SPEAKER_04]: interactions of the plant with their
system that we are bringing into the
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouses, into the indoor facilities to
balance the system out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are very interesting innovations in
that field to bring even further on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that also takes time because we are
talking about living beings interacting
[SPEAKER_04]: with each other and understanding how that
works in scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: You will see often scientific papers
coming with a new technique, with a new
[SPEAKER_04]: aspect of it that they say it works very
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a positive feedback that the
plants will grow X amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please bear in mind that that was done in
a scientific system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Small areas, highly controlled to actually
understand the mechanism of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that needs a scalability.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is where we are at with many of
these.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have biostimulants coming, many of them
that are coming into the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they are coming to the market,
feel free to ask them what was tested and
[SPEAKER_04]: how did it scale up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because then you will get the feeling of
where it stands on the market compared to
[SPEAKER_04]: the scale that you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some things work really well on the small
scale, but then on the larger scale,
[SPEAKER_04]: it just don't have capacity to keep it
going on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on a small scale, it works really
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then if you have a small scale
infrastructure, then it might be a good
[SPEAKER_04]: solution for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have hectares of it, might not.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that it's not scalable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So measure the solutions to the scale that
you're working at.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would suggest that, but yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it once again.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're out of time, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tia Furu, the entire crew.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunny Marou, Lucas, Sabrina.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
