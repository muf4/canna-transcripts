[SPEAKER_03]: The California Bureau of Cannabis Control,
Laurie Ajax, let's hear it for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be kind of a unique
experience for me because I get to sit
[SPEAKER_05]: next to a regulator without wanting to
shake some sense into them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it should be kind of a fun
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just before we start, I want to kind of
cover a very brief history, because those
[SPEAKER_05]: of you that know me know I'm a nerd that
way, of both California and Vancouver and
[SPEAKER_05]: BC in particular.
[SPEAKER_05]: They share a very long parallel history.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were both hubs during the gold rush.
[SPEAKER_05]: They both housed a lot of ex-railroad
workers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were both involved with the opium
war.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they also contributed a lot to
cannabis, both individually and together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting in the counterculture movements
in the 60s, we saw a lot of draft dodgers
[SPEAKER_05]: come up to Vancouver and BC, which did
actually revitalize our cannabis community
[SPEAKER_05]: up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it also created an interesting
situation where one of those draft dodgers
[SPEAKER_05]: met a descendant of a Chinese man who had
come over here during the opium wars,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they formed one of the most potent
pairs in cannabis, Cheech and Chong.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was one of the first sort of
partnerships that BC and California
[SPEAKER_05]: shared.
[SPEAKER_05]: In 1991, a man named Thomas O'Malley
opened the first Compassion Club,
[SPEAKER_05]: the first cannabis dispensary in the world
for at least 50, 60 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he inspired a bunch of cannabis
communities up here to also start
[SPEAKER_05]: Compassion Clubs, the BC Compassion Club
Society, Victoria Cannabis Island and
[SPEAKER_05]: Byler's Club, and Toronto Compassion Club,
COM, and a few in Toronto as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they shared very similar histories
until fairly recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, of course, in Vancouver, we have
federal regulation, which has meant that
[SPEAKER_05]: BC doesn't really get a chance to kind of
regulate its own industry, whereas in
[SPEAKER_05]: California, the US federal government is
not so much for it, which leaves
[SPEAKER_05]: California free to at least kind of
regulate their own local state industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the other issues that we've been
having that are both parallel is that the
[SPEAKER_05]: focus on adult use market or the
recreational market has really sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: left medical dispensaries as sort of a
side issue that people aren't really
[SPEAKER_05]: interested in talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It keeps being kind of put off.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Laurie, that's my first question for
you is where is California in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: their medical program?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, first of all, thank you very much
for having me here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as much as she may want to shake a
regulator, I'll put myself over.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can shake me.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just so much to learn here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just find it fascinating what's going on
here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you look at the medical market in
California, I think we're also seeing it
[SPEAKER_09]: shrinking just from the sheer fact of how
we regulate it now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Early on in 2018, we used to require
licensees.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you wanted to do adult use and medical
use, you had to get separate licenses to
[SPEAKER_09]: do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you'd have to come in and get your
medical license to sell to medical
[SPEAKER_09]: patients and then adult use license to
sell to consumers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that really wasn't working well.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's probably when the industry really
was like, really, this doesn't make a lot
[SPEAKER_09]: of sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're getting two licenses for the same
premises.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're basically filling out the same
application.
[SPEAKER_09]: So within about six months of 2018,
we changed that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have one license.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the license is designated adult
use or medical use.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's really determined by the local
jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because California, in order for the state
to issue any sort of commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: license, it has to be approved by the
local jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_09]: And California is very large.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's over 500 different local
jurisdictions across the state.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we still have jurisdictions that just
allow medical.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some allow both.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think what we're seeing is for the
average patient, it's a lot easier just to
[SPEAKER_09]: go in and buy it as adult use.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they don't have to get a
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_09]: That costs money.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have to get a medical marijuana
card.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think you're finding more
consumers are just skipping that part of
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing we've been looking at,
though, is access.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we still have a lot of
jurisdictions in California that don't
[SPEAKER_09]: allow commercial cannabis activity.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're just about two thirds still.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for our medical patients, there's some
areas that are very difficult for them to
[SPEAKER_09]: get legal access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So one of our regulations does allow,
if you're licensed, to deliver in
[SPEAKER_09]: California.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can deliver anywhere in the state.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that has created some controversy in
California for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no idea what happened there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's working.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was one of the things that I
wanted to talk about a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, Laurie can't talk about it
that much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the state really did go to bat for
delivery services.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're being sued by cities now to
not allow delivery services, which is why
[SPEAKER_05]: she can't talk about it as much as she'd
like to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, one of the reasons why I was kind of
sad when I heard that, because I was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: that sort of sets you apart from most of
the regulators up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our regulators up here are very happy to
forget about medical.
[SPEAKER_05]: The situation that you're describing is
almost sort of wished for, where they can
[SPEAKER_05]: just shunt medical patients to the adult
system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they don't track it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it becomes easier to forget that
cannabis is medicine again.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that, in terms of where it's at
for medical, what is going on with just
[SPEAKER_05]: the strictly adult use side?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, again, we're looking at about 6,000,
I think around 6,500 licenses across the
[SPEAKER_09]: state, across the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are seeing a lot of areas that still
don't have licensing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in those areas, we want to make sure
that people have a legal access to get
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you are seeing people go to the adult
use market, go to licensed retailers.
[SPEAKER_09]: They want the different brands and
varieties that you can get from licensed
[SPEAKER_09]: retailers.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think what we're looking at right
now is, believe it or not, when we look at
[SPEAKER_09]: distribution versus retailer, we have more
distributors right now than we do
[SPEAKER_09]: retailers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think for us, we're hoping we can
get more jurisdictions to allow retail
[SPEAKER_09]: sales because I think for consumers,
you want competition.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, you don't want to drive two hours
to get legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of work to do on that front and
working with the local jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and that involves different
jurisdictions because sometimes it's the
[SPEAKER_05]: city, sometimes it's the county.
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct, correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said I wasn't going to put you on the
spot, but what other governmental agencies
[SPEAKER_05]: are getting involved?
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, here in BC, the
Agricultural Land Commission decided that
[SPEAKER_05]: they were going to have a chance to kind
of express an opinion on stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got Metro Vancouver that's trying to
put limits on growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like all of these other areas of
government that are also trying to step
[SPEAKER_05]: in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, our statute actually sets up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we didn't do anything easy in
California.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a lot of different state agencies
involved.
[SPEAKER_09]: So not only do you have the local control
issue, you have three different licensing
[SPEAKER_09]: authorities.
[SPEAKER_09]: The agency I oversee, the Bureau of
Cannabis Control, is the lead agency,
[SPEAKER_09]: but when it comes to issuing cultivation
licenses, we have the Department of Food
[SPEAKER_09]: and Agriculture for manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Department of Public Health issues
those licenses.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a cultivator, you also have to
get your water permit.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to get a permit with Fish and
Wildlife, and then you deal with,
[SPEAKER_09]: for your seller's permit on taxes,
you have to deal with the taxing agencies.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of intersection with a lot of
different state agencies.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the agency, which especially when
you're looking at a market that was
[SPEAKER_09]: really, in California, a medical market
that really wasn't regulated by the state,
[SPEAKER_09]: and at some point maybe some regulation at
the local level, but trying to get all
[SPEAKER_09]: those folks in and then say, hey,
by the way, you got to deal with five
[SPEAKER_09]: different agency.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be daunting for anybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then again, it's like, here is the
government.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want all this information from you.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want you to keep records, which
typically that's probably what you didn't
[SPEAKER_09]: want to do prior to regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of something the government
encouraged you not to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's interesting and for sure
challenging, and I think for any
[SPEAKER_09]: regulator, maybe we have a tendency to
probably be over-regulated at times or a
[SPEAKER_09]: little conservative, but a lot of times
it's because we don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: information.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we started out in this journey,
three and a half years ago with first
[SPEAKER_09]: setting up medical statutory framework and
then adult use, it's like you're doing,
[SPEAKER_09]: and not that you want to hear this,
but you just didn't have a lot to look.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had Colorado to look at and Washington,
but really for California, it's so unique.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of times as a regulator,
you put something out there and sometimes
[SPEAKER_09]: it works, sometimes it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will say in California, when you
look at all the folks regulating,
[SPEAKER_09]: the one thing I will say is we want to
continue to engage with the industry and
[SPEAKER_09]: we do make changes.
[SPEAKER_09]: When things don't work, we make changes
and we try to do it fairly quickly because
[SPEAKER_09]: we know for a lot of you that are in the
legal market, no matter where you are,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's a struggle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if the regulators aren't listening and
we aren't seeing like, hey, you know what,
[SPEAKER_09]: as long as it's not gonna compromise
public safety, it's up to us to really
[SPEAKER_09]: continue to engage you and make sure that
we're making those changes so you can
[SPEAKER_09]: thrive.
[SPEAKER_05]: A question around consumption.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some cities like San Francisco allow
consumption on retail type premises or
[SPEAKER_05]: lounge areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: How is California deal with, you know,
up in Canada, of course, that stuff is
[SPEAKER_05]: actually regulated provincially,
but usually they just kind of sweep it
[SPEAKER_05]: under the Tobacco Smoking Act and just
kind of leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how does California handle that part of
it?
[SPEAKER_09]: So California, for the most part,
consumption on retail premises,
[SPEAKER_09]: it has to be approved at the local level.
[SPEAKER_09]: So most of that's pushed down for the
local jurisdiction to determine whether or
[SPEAKER_09]: not they want consumption.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, it can only happen at retail
premises.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're starting to see places that,
well, we don't want to sell cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: but we just want to have a place where
people can bring their cannabis and
[SPEAKER_09]: consume.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we're right now trying to deal
with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you need to be licensed?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you not need to be licensed?
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the things we're dealing
with, and we're dealing with some issues
[SPEAKER_09]: with cities that they want to have more
than just consumption.
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to also, you know, serve other
items like coffee and, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: food and things like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the things that we're gonna
be looking at really closely over the next
[SPEAKER_09]: few months is, you know, how do you
normalize it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, for most of us,
if you don't consume cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: but maybe you have friends that do,
you want to be able to go to places where,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, your friend can consume cannabis
and maybe you can have a, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: a coffee or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think we're gonna see more of
that coming, especially with all the
[SPEAKER_09]: tourism we have in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's time we evolve.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it seems like, I'm gonna tell you,
it's been a year and a half, like a year
[SPEAKER_09]: and seven months in California,
and it feels like it's been so much
[SPEAKER_09]: longer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're like, hey, let's evolve.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, but it's true.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys move at lightning fast speed and,
you know, you just sort of drag us along
[SPEAKER_09]: with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least you're willing to be
drugged.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all regulators are.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the favorite things, you know,
you mentioned normalization, and that's
[SPEAKER_05]: been one of the favorite things I've seen
out of California so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a campaign a while ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember who was responsible for
it, but it was showing like Rockwell type
[SPEAKER_05]: family images.
[SPEAKER_05]: And over in the corner, there'd just be an
ashtray with a joint in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really subtle and really nice
to see you guys have launched weed wise,
[SPEAKER_05]: hashtag weed wise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell us a little bit about that
program?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, as most of you know,
we've, we've got a lot of challenges in
[SPEAKER_09]: California and especially the illegal
market, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And the unlicensed market and making sure
people under, you know, have, we educate
[SPEAKER_09]: them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So one, you want to always, you know,
we're always looking to issue licenses and
[SPEAKER_09]: then aggressively attack the unlicensed
market, but we always felt there needed to
[SPEAKER_09]: be an educational component to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we lost a launched a public awareness
campaign back in June called hashtag weed
[SPEAKER_09]: wise.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really has two goals.
[SPEAKER_09]: One, it's to let the unlicensed market
know that if you're conducting commercial
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis activity, you have to have a
license and you need to get licensed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise you're going to get shut down.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's, that's one part of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second part is really educating
the consumers on why it's important that
[SPEAKER_09]: they go to a licensed retail shop.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, it's great that we license
everybody, but if an average consumer
[SPEAKER_09]: doesn't know whether they're walking into
a legal shop or not, we've only,
[SPEAKER_09]: we haven't done our, we haven't done our
job, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to, just because we talk about,
you know, I don't, I think we all talk
[SPEAKER_09]: about this probably 24 seven, but your
average consumer doesn't know when they
[SPEAKER_09]: walk into a retail shop, is this license,
is this unlicensed and why it's important
[SPEAKER_09]: that they're probably paying more than
they are on the legal market, why it is
[SPEAKER_09]: that, you know, telling them we're testing
it, you're going to get safe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's been, it's been really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just launched a license.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know we had our regular license search
and, but we launched it and it's called ca
[SPEAKER_09]: pot check.com.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've been really pushing that out
there so people can check if they're
[SPEAKER_09]: walking into a store, they can check to
see if or not they have a license and
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: So really some exciting stuff going on
with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I always say, I, I don't, I don't
think in my entire state career,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd ever think that the state of
California would have a website called ca
[SPEAKER_09]: pot check.com, but here we are,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually, well, and, and you also ran a
public service announcement starring teach
[SPEAKER_05]: Marin as a government regulator who would
answer your questions if you wanted to get
[SPEAKER_05]: licensed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, one of the issues that we've
been having up here is that our existing
[SPEAKER_05]: illegal market is actually higher quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: By most standards than our regulated
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've got a lot more customer
loyalty.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's barriers around testing for sure,
because some of them do get it tested,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they can't really tell you that they
got it tested because the lab doesn't want
[SPEAKER_05]: to say that they've been testing illegal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And California is also in a very similar
situation where you've got some areas that
[SPEAKER_05]: have a lot of experience with cannabis,
a very knowledgeable consumers and a
[SPEAKER_05]: highly developed market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you've got other areas that the
markets probably not quite as developed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what would you say are the barriers for
currently illicit retailers, for example,
[SPEAKER_05]: to get licensed?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I, and most of it is their local
jurisdiction, maybe where they've been
[SPEAKER_09]: operating for a long time is not allowing
commercial cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's, that's a big barrier.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then finding a city or county that is
going to allow it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, when, when we say there's
483 cities and 58 counties, that means
[SPEAKER_09]: you're going to each local jurisdiction,
trying to see if your business can do,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, if they're even accepting
applications.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it is a patchwork of ordinances across
the state.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's a big barrier.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also think, you know, again,
going back to, I think it's a daunting
[SPEAKER_09]: task, you know, where do you even start?
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're somebody that has been doing
this for a long time, it's even hard to
[SPEAKER_09]: know where to start.
[SPEAKER_09]: So more technical assistance is needed for
these folks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trying to, you know, you know,
you know, remove the mystery.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think when you just tell people,
hey, fill out this big long application
[SPEAKER_09]: and you got to get a background track,
I think it's an intimidating process.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think as a state, we've got to keep
realizing that this is not easy for folks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how do you bring them in to the
process?
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the things we look at when we
do look at enforcement, we are making,
[SPEAKER_09]: we are looking at going after the folks
that really have no intention of getting
[SPEAKER_09]: licensed.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you have people that are trying to
get licensed, trying to work with their
[SPEAKER_09]: local jurisdiction in the process,
we're really trying to really make sure
[SPEAKER_09]: that we're bringing those people along.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because really, we want compliance.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, you know, if we're working
to, you know, I know it sounds strange to
[SPEAKER_09]: say we want, we've got to work together
with the industry to make sure that
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody survives.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because as the state, we want the legal
market to survive.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want them to do well.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want them to thrive.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we're not doing it together with
you, it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's the difference right there
between a regulatory body that's able to
[SPEAKER_05]: regulate its own local industry and a
regulatory body that's on the other side
[SPEAKER_05]: of the country that has to worry about
other local industries as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been questions around shipping.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's mostly quieted down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think last year was when it was a really
big deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: With testing, what have been some of the
biggest challenges from the regulator's
[SPEAKER_05]: point of view to make sure that you're
doing what works for the industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: but what also works for the state?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So transportation of cannabis in
California, you have to be a distributor
[SPEAKER_09]: just to transport cannabis between
licensees.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you also have to submit a,
you have to have a manifest showing where
[SPEAKER_09]: you're going and what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is, it's a great system and having
that and track and trace.
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, it doesn't allow for a lot of
flexibility, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: If something happens and you need to go to
another premises.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty strictly regulated in
transportation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then a lot of these folks are carrying
a lot of cash.
[SPEAKER_09]: So our distributors are responsible for
collecting the taxes from the different
[SPEAKER_09]: licensees.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of safety issues regarding
transportation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is, I think eventually over time
that'll change.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, when you look at like the alcohol
world in California, you don't really have
[SPEAKER_09]: those strict rules in place for
transportation.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think for right now, that's what
needs to happen because we still have so
[SPEAKER_09]: much illegal cannabis being transported.
[SPEAKER_09]: For the laboratories, I mean, I'm sure
we're having some of the same,
[SPEAKER_09]: we are having some of the same issues all
the other states have had.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have very strict testing regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have labs that are, you know,
they're getting better at what they're
[SPEAKER_09]: testing for.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, one of the things we are
seeing, it's expensive for the legal
[SPEAKER_09]: market to test.
[SPEAKER_09]: And especially if things fail,
you know, fail and they can't remediate
[SPEAKER_09]: it, then they have to destroy it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's really tough on the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: The good thing is, is that, you know,
our failure rate compared to, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: when we started, you know, back in January
of 2018, our failure rate was at about
[SPEAKER_09]: 20%.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're now down to just about 8%.
[SPEAKER_09]: The labs are getting better.
[SPEAKER_09]: The product, you know, there's a lot of
testing that goes in, R&D testing that
[SPEAKER_09]: goes prior to the regulatory testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're seeing a lot of this product
getting through to the legal market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we've had some of those vaping
incidents in California where people were
[SPEAKER_09]: getting sick, very sick off of vape
cartridges they had purchased.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the good thing is, is that so far that
appears that it only come from the
[SPEAKER_09]: unlicensed market.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has not come from our legal regulated
market, which is really a, I mean,
[SPEAKER_09]: is, you know, you don't want to see people
getting sick, but it's good to see that it
[SPEAKER_09]: is working having this product tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and I think that from, you know,
from a long time activist point of view,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the whole point of regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to see people being able to
take advantage.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, in the illicit market for
10,000 years, it's been fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's also been stories of the
random person that sprays something that
[SPEAKER_05]: they know is bad or and it's like,
you know, they end up giving everybody a
[SPEAKER_05]: bad reputation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the point of regulation for
anything should be just that, make sure
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: With shipping, I know that there was a
union that got involved that wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of try and provide all the shipping.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't want smaller growers to be
able to ship themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't really have a database of that
stuff the way that Washington State does
[SPEAKER_05]: though.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that protected you from hacking because
Washington State not that long ago had
[SPEAKER_05]: some kind of a system where you could have
somebody break into their system and find
[SPEAKER_05]: out where every single shipment of
cannabis was going everywhere in the state
[SPEAKER_05]: for like the next two weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you worried about cybersecurity of any
of California's records or documents?
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: You worry about that all the time because
we, you know, most of our applicants
[SPEAKER_09]: submit applications online to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say probably at least 98% of the
application we get is through our
[SPEAKER_09]: licensing system and not paper.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the thought, I'm going to tell you the
thought that anybody hacks in and gets a
[SPEAKER_09]: hold of your information is really
concerning because, you know, you need to,
[SPEAKER_09]: if we're going to get people to come into
the legal market, they need to know that
[SPEAKER_09]: their information is protected by the
state unless it's required by under our
[SPEAKER_09]: Public Records Act to disclose.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want people just getting a hold
of this information.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, you know, that's our job,
you know, and doing our due diligence to
[SPEAKER_09]: make sure that your information is not
compromised.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's always something you worry
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And have you had issues?
[SPEAKER_05]: Has it been?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not, you know, we're just starting,
you know, we're just getting everybody
[SPEAKER_09]: transitioned to track and trace over the
last six months.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we haven't had any issues yet,
but yeah, I know I don't have any wood
[SPEAKER_09]: here, but you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, we want you to feel like when
you come to the government, you're not
[SPEAKER_09]: worried that, you know, all your
information is getting in for safety
[SPEAKER_09]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_09]: If everybody's getting a hold of your
shipping manifest and they know where
[SPEAKER_09]: you're going, that's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, again, there's only so much a
state can do in terms of municipalities.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have their own jurisdiction over
certain things.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen cities, for example,
again, in the Bay Area where Oakland,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, offered, you know, parity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Licensing they've offered in Berkeley,
they cover some medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been other cities that have
kind of picked up Oakland's banner and
[SPEAKER_05]: said, yeah, you know what, we unfairly
punished this war.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we need to make sure that those
people have the same opportunities.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you reconcile the fact that as a
state, you kind of have to stay out of
[SPEAKER_05]: some of that, but you've got one city that
is happy to try and address an injustice
[SPEAKER_05]: and another city that's happy to keep that
injustice going as long as possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I'm going to tell you Oakland,
San Francisco, Sacramento, L.A.,
[SPEAKER_09]: the big cities have really been the
leaders, these local jurisdictions,
[SPEAKER_09]: on the social equity front.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the state is really trying to catch up
and looking at, you know, how folks have
[SPEAKER_09]: been affected by the war on drugs in
California and sort of righting those
[SPEAKER_09]: wrongs.
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing the administration and we have
grant funding at the state level for local
[SPEAKER_09]: jurisdictions that have a local program in
place for social equity.
[SPEAKER_09]: We just closed that application period and
next month we're going to be awarding 10
[SPEAKER_09]: million in grants to those cities that
have those local equity programs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then just recently the governor in his
latest budget even put more money for next
[SPEAKER_09]: year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's 30 million will be going out next
year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So another round of funding.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we're starting to see already is
the big cities already led the charge,
[SPEAKER_09]: but now you're having local jurisdictions
going, hey, we need to do something in
[SPEAKER_09]: developing these programs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think we're seeing a lot more
cities and counties that are saying,
[SPEAKER_09]: hey, we need to do something about this as
well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm pretty proud of the state of
California for taking this on.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be interesting to see what happens.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully I can come back next year and
tell you guys how that first round of
[SPEAKER_09]: funding went and what we were able to
accomplish.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had another question and it just popped
right out of my head just as we were
[SPEAKER_05]: talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the issues that have existed are
around security records up here,
[SPEAKER_05]: pardons, expungements, whether that stays
on your record or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, I'm really happy to hear that
actually California as a state is kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: encouraging as much as they can within
their realm of what they're allowed to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything that you think that the
state could be doing more?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I mean, that's already more than
most states are doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I say we got a lot going on in
California, just like you do up here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I always think we can do more.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's I don't think there's a
day go by when you feel like we're
[SPEAKER_09]: probably not doing enough to really assist
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so and that's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want us to feel this way, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always something more we can do to
help small businesses to level the playing
[SPEAKER_09]: field and do all that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's something that is always
very important to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And and we have a very active cannabis
industry and they're very innovative and
[SPEAKER_09]: creative.
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes I hear these business models
and I like I didn't think of that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't think of that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's always good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I say thank goodness for you guys
for telling, you know, because we wouldn't
[SPEAKER_09]: figure out you guys have probably more
good ideas than we the regulators.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I always say, don't keep your good
ideas to yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring them to us so we can start
implementing some of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that earlier question.
[SPEAKER_05]: California has had water rights issues for
a very, very long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: How has that played into cannabis
regulations in different jurisdictions?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's probably for our cultivators.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a really big issue for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a separate state agency called the
State Water Resources Board that deals
[SPEAKER_09]: with this.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, that's become a you know,
that's a big permit you have to get when
[SPEAKER_09]: you're a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_09]: So where you're getting your water,
how you're getting it very strictly
[SPEAKER_09]: regulated in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: But not hasn't really it's kind of stayed
in that bureau and not really crossed over
[SPEAKER_09]: too much for us at the bureau because we
sort of have the the supply chain starting
[SPEAKER_09]: with distribution, testing labs,
retailers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it doesn't really hit our agency as
much.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I know a lot of our cultivators,
there is a lot of permits that they have
[SPEAKER_09]: to get in order to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that's been very difficult,
especially on your small legacy
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of a similar question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here in Vancouver, we've got a group
called Metrovan that represents a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: cities in the lower mainland area.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're trying to basically say that
outdoor cannabis growing is bad for
[SPEAKER_05]: pollution and smog, to the point where
they've actually suggested that on bad air
[SPEAKER_05]: days, people move their cannabis plants
inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: California has also traditionally had a
lot of issues with smog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Has this been an issue at all that you've
seen?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm not I don't not that I know of
yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that it's become an issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm sure that doesn't mean there's not
something going on in L.A.
[SPEAKER_09]: or whatever, because it's almost I don't
know about you guys, but I like do a ton
[SPEAKER_09]: of reading like every night.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're reading tons of articles and
there's always something going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm sure that's going to hit us very
soon on these sorts of issues.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're pretty good to go to the
audience for some questions and answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear one more time for Laurie Ajax
and Jamie Shaw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very informative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm coming over here to you right now,
sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, please try to keep your questions
brief.
[SPEAKER_03]: No rambling.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know how you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to hear the whole story
about the history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just hold your hand up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a question, I'll get right
over to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Laurie, I've seen you speak out a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen you speak at a lot of events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done public comments in front of you
for regulation, specifically on topical
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just got to say,
BCC did a really good job of publishing
[SPEAKER_01]: the draft regulations, taking in public
comment across the state, listening to the
[SPEAKER_01]: business, just listening to you now and
talking about how you want to work with
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry in California is
inspiring, especially compared to another
[SPEAKER_01]: department like the DMV, where they don't
want to work with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody wants to be compared to the DMV.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my question is, I'm starting to see a
lot of wars going on between wine and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specific example would be Santa Barbara
County that has limited the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that will be cultivated in the
county.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reasons for that being land issues,
water issues, but also what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: calling the terpene drift, where these
like terpenes go into the air and affect
[SPEAKER_01]: the terroir of the wine and the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any other issues like that coming up in
Sonoma County or other parts of California
[SPEAKER_01]: that you see?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you see that being resolved?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's actually I find that that's
fascinating what's going on with our wine
[SPEAKER_09]: industry and the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how, you know, farms next to each
other are dealing with, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: because our wineries can use pesticides
that our cannabis folks can't use.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how do they share, you know,
being side by side?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I think this issue will is already,
for lack of a better way, drifting up
[SPEAKER_09]: north.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I think you're looking at as much
as we can now probably engage our wine
[SPEAKER_09]: grower, our grape growers and what not.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think already they're sort of like,
sort of like a natural, they're all going,
[SPEAKER_09]: well, wait a sec, we don't want the
cannabis people next to us and the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis people don't want them next to
us.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's an interesting issue that I didn't
really see coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say this, I think the alcohol folks
are saying, please don't regulate us like
[SPEAKER_09]: you regulate cannabis, because I think
they're worried that at some point we
[SPEAKER_09]: might be testing grapes the way we test
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so in some ways, maybe that's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're seeing that because I think what
we're starting to see is other industry
[SPEAKER_09]: now getting affected and seeing like,
wow, cannabis is really regulated,
[SPEAKER_09]: really highly regulated, and we don't want
to be regulated to that extent.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that'll be interesting to see
how that plays out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, Lori and Jamie.
[SPEAKER_12]: My question is about edibles or
alternative products.
[SPEAKER_12]: Here in Canada, we have legal dried
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I understand in California,
you have more experience rolling out
[SPEAKER_12]: edible products.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's gonna happen this year in Canada.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you talk a little bit about edible
products in California?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we started out with edibles right on
the onset.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that's a little different than
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the things we really looked at
is that's where we really looked at some
[SPEAKER_09]: of the other states and how that rollout
went.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we have some fairly strict
regulation when it comes to edibles,
[SPEAKER_09]: the package, how much you can have in the
package and child-resistant packaging,
[SPEAKER_09]: what those edibles can look like.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can't be attractive to children.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I will say that's where we really
did look at some of the other states and
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing where they were having some issues.
[SPEAKER_09]: But like anything, edibles, they
constantly change.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the other day, we had to ask our
Department of Public Health.
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw cannabis-infused toothpicks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we thought, well, what is this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this an edible?
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it came out, it's an edible.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think for the regulator, though,
I think whatever regulations you put in
[SPEAKER_09]: place, it's always gonna change with the
different products coming our way and do
[SPEAKER_09]: they really fit into the edible category
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's always gonna be a
challenge for any regulator is keeping up
[SPEAKER_09]: with the innovation of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Lori.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering, is there any communication
between your bureau and Health Canada and
[SPEAKER_00]: learning from each other and on how to
adjust public policy accordingly moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward?
[SPEAKER_09]: So Health Canada did come to California
and we did meet with them and then they
[SPEAKER_09]: work a lot with our public health
department here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think the best thing we can do is
just share what we're going through,
[SPEAKER_09]: our experiences, share our regulations,
and provide that open line of
[SPEAKER_09]: communication.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will just say this, nobody wants to,
just like you as an industry folk,
[SPEAKER_09]: you wanna be able to call your counterpart
and get an answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's our commitment, not necessarily
shaping what they do here, but at least
[SPEAKER_09]: making sure that we're answering their
calls and we're providing whatever support
[SPEAKER_09]: we can, because I think that's good for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Slow clap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned packaging.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't actually been in any of the
so-called legal stores in Vancouver yet,
[SPEAKER_07]: but my friends tell me that they're
packaged within an inch of their life and
[SPEAKER_07]: non reusable, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: This doesn't seem like a good idea for the
long haul.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's California doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we package, we do a lot of packaging
in California and we even have child
[SPEAKER_09]: resistant packaging on flour.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of packaging and we get a lot of
complaints that, you know, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_09]: recycle and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do think like, we're gonna,
I think in California, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: what are we really trying, especially with
like cannabis flour?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we really think somebody's,
a child's gonna get into it and smoke?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but I think we did start out
very conservative because the last thing
[SPEAKER_09]: we want is for children to get into this
packaging.
[SPEAKER_09]: We wanna make sure that parents,
you know, are putting it in a safe place.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we wanna make sure that on the
onset, if something, we wanna make sure we
[SPEAKER_09]: have those protections in place.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think in some ways that's good,
but I think as we evolve, I think it's
[SPEAKER_09]: time to look at some of those and
determine where do we really need to
[SPEAKER_09]: really be strictly regulate that
packaging.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, there's a part of us that
we don't want any negative press to come
[SPEAKER_09]: on our legal market for things if we
didn't do the proper precautions.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, it's just not really knowing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think as we see like maybe there's not
an incident, then we start making those
[SPEAKER_09]: changes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just got a question about banking and
payment processing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you give us a little update into
Cali as to what the latest is on that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't really, I don't have any
latest information on banking.
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know, we struggle to get banks and
credit unions to bank the cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: industry in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: What we do is right now just try to work
with those banking regulators to give them
[SPEAKER_09]: as much information for those that do
wanna bank the industry to provide them
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever we can to give them the
assurances that this person is in good
[SPEAKER_09]: standing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think, you know, right now the
banks are still hesitant to get in.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very expensive for them to bank the
industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, for us, you know,
we wanna get out of the, we wanna get out
[SPEAKER_09]: of taking, accepting cash at the Bureau.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're, you know, last month we're
accepting like three million in cash for
[SPEAKER_09]: licensing fees.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it just doesn't make a lot of
sense, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And all the security we have to put into
place.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and you know, we understand the
average.
[SPEAKER_09]: If somebody does get banked, and the bank
doesn't know they're a cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_09]: it's usually 12 to 18 months and that bank
figures it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they have to start all over
again.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you've seen some bills in the
legislature on banking.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we're continuing to try to push
the issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: And hopefully we're gonna see something
from, I mean, I think if we're gonna see
[SPEAKER_09]: anything from the federal government,
that would be a start to see it when it
[SPEAKER_09]: comes to banking issue, because it's just
not safe anymore for people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and one of the things that came up
around that was starting a state bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think the possibilities of
that happening are?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it would be very hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: One, I think it would take too long to get
up and running.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know how effective it would
be.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really think really working on our
current banks and credit unions and
[SPEAKER_09]: probably giving them the assurances that
we need, because a lot of the information
[SPEAKER_09]: we have as a state regulator is what the
banks wanna see.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think continually working on that at
our level and at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm gonna tell you, as a regulator,
it's really hard when you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_09]: such a cash-intensive business.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard for you guys to pay your vendors
and it's hard for us to regulate something
[SPEAKER_09]: when it's so much cash out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey Laurie, quick question about vapor
pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to see if there was an action
plan in order to sustainably recycle vapor
[SPEAKER_02]: pens as that whole industry's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gotten a lot more popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just heard that there's a lot of
regulatory issues with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so we require, you have to make it
unrecognizable and unusable.
[SPEAKER_09]: But most of that is handled by,
guess what, another state agency in
[SPEAKER_09]: California called CalRecycle.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we got a lot of state agencies.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's, just like the other
gentleman's questions on packaging,
[SPEAKER_09]: I think California needs to start really
looking at how best to recycle these
[SPEAKER_09]: products, these vape pens, the housing
units, all the packaging.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think California is very concerned
about the environment and all that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're gonna start seeing some
changes go through when it comes to those
[SPEAKER_09]: issues.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, again, we're learning more about
these products and now we're learning more
[SPEAKER_09]: about cannabis waste.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so again, I think you're gonna see
more of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Jeff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question about prison reform in
California.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Prison reform in California.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that they've promised to let out
all of our men and women.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us about full clemency, how many have
been let out, or what is the plan to
[SPEAKER_08]: release our plant prisoners that should
not be in jail?
[SPEAKER_09]: So that doesn't fall under the Bureau of
Cannabis Control.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not involved with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's at the administration level with
the governor.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I can't answer that question for
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can speak on it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of cities and counties are already
expunging records and they just,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember the name of the nerds
that came up with the AI algorithm that
[SPEAKER_03]: searches through the database and finds
people whose records would be helped by
[SPEAKER_03]: the new law and fills out the paperwork
and just sends it off to the DA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the DA either signs off on it or
decides to try to fight it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've already got like 500,000 people
have had their records cleared.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Marissa, who's from San Francisco,
the cannabis regulator, I know she could
[SPEAKER_09]: probably give you a lot of information on
that and what they're doing in San
[SPEAKER_11]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: The nerds are Code for America.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in San Francisco actually we're the
first jurisdiction to retroactively
[SPEAKER_10]: expunge over 9,000 records.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think we, thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the Bay Area, I think you'd be hard
pressed, especially in our local prisons
[SPEAKER_10]: to find anyone incarcerated for just a
cannabis offense.
[SPEAKER_10]: On the federal level, I think the work is
still needed for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, the programs are happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to encourage other jurisdictions
to do the same work.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is doable.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You call the San Francisco district
attorney's office, speak to George Gasco
[SPEAKER_10]: and he'll tell you how.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, my name is Ellen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from the Kootenays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were talking about the different
conditions in California for medical
[SPEAKER_04]: versus in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me just put my glasses on again so
I can see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say that Canadian
conditions actually seem quite different
[SPEAKER_04]: because we have a medical system here that
pays for things so we don't have to go to
[SPEAKER_04]: pay to get prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can get a doctor's prescription for
free, providing of course we can find a
[SPEAKER_04]: doctor who will give us a prescription.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we have to, our new dispensaries
or whatever we want to call them,
[SPEAKER_04]: our new recreational outlets can only
provide a dosage of 10 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a problem for our medical
users.
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially our legacy dispensaries are
being shut down, which we're providing all
[SPEAKER_04]: the medical doses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now these new dispensaries,
the legal ones, are being opened with a 10
[SPEAKER_04]: milligram per dose limit, which is totally
ineffective.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like you can imagine a kid with
dravettes having to take 2,500 milligrams
[SPEAKER_04]: a dose and having to take 200 and 2,500
pills.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what that is, but it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's totally unreasonable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a real issue that has to be
dealt with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how did you guys start out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they just start out having any
possible dose or you know, we're limited
[SPEAKER_04]: now, so.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the manufacturer part of it is handled
by our department of public health and
[SPEAKER_09]: they do have limits on package size and 10
milligram dose, but it is different
[SPEAKER_09]: between the adult use and the medical
market.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a higher limit for medical
patients than it is for adult use.
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, they can sell the higher dose
if they have if they're designated as a
[SPEAKER_09]: medical retailer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So their license is designated and so
that's how we're doing it right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I should mention California is
also, because as most probably some of you
[SPEAKER_09]: know, our collective cooperative model was
that sunsetted early in January of this
[SPEAKER_09]: year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't have the collective and
cooperatives, but there is a bill pending
[SPEAKER_09]: in the legislature to what's really
happening in California is similar to what
[SPEAKER_09]: you were saying.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a lot of compassion care programs
that would really help our veterans and
[SPEAKER_09]: our terminally ill patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: And once the collective cooperative model,
which, you know, allowed these folks to
[SPEAKER_09]: give them medicinal cannabis went away,
there really wasn't a path for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do have some pending legislation
that would allow our cultivators and
[SPEAKER_09]: manufacturers to donate product to a
retailer to give to those compassion care
[SPEAKER_09]: program at the local jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll see what happens if that gets
signed by the governor.
[SPEAKER_09]: So something else we're trying to,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's been talk of doing something
like that in Canada when we get back to
[SPEAKER_05]: medical because basically one of the
reasons why we haven't talked about
[SPEAKER_05]: medical more is because the federal
government has said there will be a review
[SPEAKER_05]: once we've actually kind of got this other
one in place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've just been able to just push off
everything to that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just curious if there is a process in
place to receive stake industry
[SPEAKER_06]: stakeholders input for when you're
creating regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, boy.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to come to California.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have a we have a really robust.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll say robust.
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets wild.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it gets wild.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what happens is at the agency level,
we develop regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then once we have our draft
regulations, we we provide them and then
[SPEAKER_09]: we go around the usually go around the
state and do public hearings.
[SPEAKER_09]: So folks can either they can come to those
public hearings.
[SPEAKER_09]: Give public comment.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can also write them in.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can email them to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do a really, really in depth process
of getting public comments.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then once we get those public
comments, we're required to respond to
[SPEAKER_09]: those public comments.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, for example, last year when we were
doing our final regulations, the bureau,
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, processed over eight thousand
comments that came in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's all that's all available to
anybody to see how we responded.
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, for every regulation we put
in place, we have to do what's called an
[SPEAKER_09]: initial statement of reason, meaning we
have to say why we're putting that
[SPEAKER_09]: regulation in place.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we tell retailers they're going to
be open from 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_09]: to 10 p.m., we have to say what's the
reasoning for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have to justify that reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it can't the only problem with that
robust process.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lengthy process.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, so there's a balance there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we try to get through as quickly as
possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yes, there's a lot of we do encourage
that feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all so very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more time, Lori Ajax, Jamie Shaw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
