[SPEAKER_03]: So what this conference entails is a
marriage of activism and business.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an amazing crowd here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The energy is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We sold out of the expo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's really excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a real buzz in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see here is that we have an
amazing mix of different people coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from the U.S., coming from Germany,
and covering all different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of the new cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can really benefit from the
experiences that different countries have
[SPEAKER_01]: already with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have to actually pinch myself that
we're at a cannabis conference,
[SPEAKER_02]: a global cannabis conference in Germany is
quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis market in Germany is growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This industry in Germany has the potential
to be the second biggest cannabis market
[SPEAKER_03]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked to a lot of people from
Berlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today in a few short hours and they're
asking the right questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: The questions are really about what do you
do, how can I help you, and really it's
[SPEAKER_04]: about connection and networking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have huge potential here in Berlin and
we have many creative and talented people
[SPEAKER_00]: who have already established a very
vibrant startup ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the longevity of what Berlin has
to offer is going to set Alex and set
[SPEAKER_04]: Berlin up for a great, prosperous future
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
