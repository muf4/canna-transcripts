[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a great crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Alex Rogers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I founded the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am very happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have full respect for Germany and
Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two or three years ago I had the idea of
building the ICBC in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big idea because I took a big
chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I built this venue for the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not a medical program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a health program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only 1,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big risk, but it paid off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a risk doing the ICBC in Germany
three years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no medical program, just a few
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really paid off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we see that Deutschland and Berlin
have the potential to be one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis capitals of the world,
and that's a very big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that you are all here gives you
an advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big deal to be here at the
inception of a market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of you understand and know
that, that you are giving yourself a
[SPEAKER_01]: competitive advantage to come to a
conference like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two days of intense information,
comprehensive information, and the first
[SPEAKER_01]: day is more based on the German laws and
regulations to let you understand what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening within Germany specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second day is more finance stuff of
what's going around in the world and what
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities lie therein.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have an after party tonight at the
Gretchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an app, Wova.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not on this app yet,
you can go to registration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have been sent an email,
but if you're not on this app,
[SPEAKER_01]: go to registration.
[SPEAKER_01]: This app is how we communicate during the
ICBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how you can network with other people
because that's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two main reasons we're here,
to get information and to get information.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two ways we do that, to listen to
the speeches and network with your
[SPEAKER_01]: colleagues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Network with the people that are,
we have people from 40 different countries
[SPEAKER_01]: here today at the ICBC, just over 1,000
people here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 40 different countries, that's
something I'm really proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really touches me that people literally
from all around the world, from Hong Kong
[SPEAKER_01]: to Russia to South Africa to Australia,
you are all here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis industry is bigger than just
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a worldwide phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: As cannabis eventually legalizes in
Germany, the fact of the matter is the
[SPEAKER_01]: more open these laws are, the better
society will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mentor was Jack Hare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you know who Jack Hare is,
but he is the godfather of the marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used to tell me that hemp can save the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was back in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came from the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this green bud with no seeds you
have in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But can hemp really save the world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Food, fuel, fiber, medicine, that was
Jack's mantra.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was out on a heat actually,
saying hemp can save the world with my
[SPEAKER_01]: dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would come crying, ha, ha,
ha, ha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we say people don't laugh as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact of the matter is, when we're
going away from local control so much with
[SPEAKER_01]: our food systems, with our medicine
systems, cannabis is a way to deal with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Environmental issues, health issues,
a lot of the industrial complexes cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: confronts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So legalizing cannabis is not just good
for your pocketbook, but it's good for the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say right now, definitively,
that cannabis can save the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to give a big shout out to
our main sponsor of the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these things couldn't happen
without them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please give some applause for Paul King in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank Noel Heller,
Vapor Dave, Viggen, Anthony Johnson,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Guile Wheel on my team for putting up
with all my shit.
Give them a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the first panels are gonna be in
German.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do not speak German after our
keynote speaker, there's a translation
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just give them your identification,
they will give you a receiver,
[SPEAKER_01]: you plug it on, and you are good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after Henry Roms, which will of course
be in English, unless Henry's
[SPEAKER_01]: automatically learned German,
[SPEAKER_01]: he will be in English, but after him will
be in German.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go to your WoW app, you will see
which panels are in English and which
[SPEAKER_01]: panels are in German.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not forget to go to the after party
tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not forget that we have the Vancouver
ICBC in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be off the chain,
very similar in numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And vibration to this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an ad on the back of the
program for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see me a couple more times
today, not too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just want to say thank you so much
to everyone right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the revolution, and know that,
and talk with people today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ICBC, we're not cliquey, we're not
provincial, we are a global family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by doing business understandably,
with these auspices, you do better
[SPEAKER_01]: business because you have more
understanding, thought, and care,
[SPEAKER_01]: and empathy for your fellow human.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only here for a little bit on this
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important what you do and how you
act.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all have an evolution, a spiritual
and ethical evolution, but just to be
[SPEAKER_01]: conscious about it is the thing that is
most important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without further ado, I would like to
introduce our keynote speaker for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a huge treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is an American icon.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a living legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons he is an American icon
is because he preaches against so much of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bad things that sometimes America
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he has a cultural, and he's probably
traveled more than any person I know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and has a cultural wherewithal of
different areas of unlike any person I've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever met.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an extremely special person.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're extremely lucky to have him here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you all give a big Berlin welcome?
[SPEAKER_01]: For Henry Rollins, everybody.
Give it up for Henry Rollins.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my fourth event I've done with
Alex in the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several months ago, he contacted me and he
said, hey, here's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went online and I checked out his
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, will you come to keynote one of
my conferences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you speak about decriminalization and
legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of cannabis, because I've written in
magazines and newspapers about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's a bit of irony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use cannabis at all, but I
vociferously advocate for its legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: and decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just 20 more seconds on me,
and then we'll get to the truly important
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been coming to Germany since 1983,
February 13th, out of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Bremen with my little band Black
Flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we played in a venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we played in a room about as big as
your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we played every song we knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the audience wouldn't let us go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to leave stage, and they
physically pushed us back onto the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, play more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we took all of our instruction from
our bass player, Chuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, just play it all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we played for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And songs like that, you only need to hear
them once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing them twice or playing them twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good thing I was 22 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have killed me to do it at any
other age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I became very happy to be in
Germany whenever I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the start of a multi-decade
love affair I've had with your country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not just sucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there's people from a lot of
different countries here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I got here yesterday, I've met
people from Australia, from Israel,
[SPEAKER_00]: from Canada, from America, from Spain,
and from, of course, Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been coming here almost every
single year since 1983.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is my second time here this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just let me, here's the real
important stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just give you the brief history of
Cannabis in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis in America is the story of
corruption, bigotry, and racism,
[SPEAKER_00]: and easy paths to incarceration.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last century, there was an
organization called the Federal Bureau of
[SPEAKER_00]: Narcotics, run by a guy named Harry J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Axlinger, who hated everything that was
not a white Christian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to get along with, right-wing person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana became the way he put black and
brown people, gay people, poet people,
[SPEAKER_00]: dreamer, artistic people, in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when, right around somewhere in
the mid-19th century, whenever they
[SPEAKER_00]: started, 19th century, whatever they
started, 20th century, sorry, whenever
[SPEAKER_00]: they started the different schedules of
drugs, that's when cannabis became a
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule one drug, along with heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in my country, they acquainted
cannabis with heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you and I both know that's laughable,
but it's an easy path to incarceration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why I advocate so strongly for
decolonization and legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in my country, it is an easy way
to throw black and brown skinned people
[SPEAKER_00]: into prison for long periods of time for
nonviolent crimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what would be the upside of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: When someone is incarcerated in America,
they become very profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably heard of the thing called
the prison industrial complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a multi-billion dollar a year
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it costs money to feed that
person, clothe that person, give them
[SPEAKER_00]: water, and as they get older, medical
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a 60-year thing that comes out
of my tax dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could be building bridges, schools,
and roads, and making things better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, we have to incarcerate people for
a frequent plan that grows out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you advocate for legalization
and decolonization, of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is much more than a business venture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are literally changing culture,
going up against big pharma, big
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, bigotry, and the way the West
has governed over people for centuries,
[SPEAKER_00]: some countries longer than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are here to upset the apple cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken upon myself to upset the apple
cart as often as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: For goodness, I don't go breaking
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't light things on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to do good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, recently, I was just in
Manila.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Manila to go to a cemetery to
visit the North Cemetery, where over 5,000
[SPEAKER_00]: people live homeless in and amongst the
dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see this for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fascinated by homelessness all over
the world, and how different companies
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout countries and municipalities
deal with homelessness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from my hotel in the center of
Manila to the north part of the city is
[SPEAKER_00]: about four miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a two-hour taxi ride because of
traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about an hour and 55 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I timed it with my stopwatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the driver's fare angered me,
not because it was too expensive,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was about $4.50 in American.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that guy was sweating as much as I
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave him about $50 in pesos.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Philippine currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kept trying to give it back to me,
thinking, silly tourist, you're giving
[SPEAKER_00]: away too much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I showed him my calculator on my
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I know exactly what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to burn up in the hot sun
driving me to some cemetery for almost two
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and get $4.50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not on my watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so take all the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as he understood that's what I
wanted to do, that I was trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something good, his face broke into this
amazing smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he lost all of his composure and
started yelling at me, or maybe some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the only English he knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just kept yelling, Happy New Year!
[SPEAKER_00]: Over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kept vigorously shaking my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I shook his hand every single time he
stuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Happy New Year to you!
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's how we're communicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I mean when I say upset
the apple cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might have been more money than that
good, hardworking guy saw all that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I can afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for him, it was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we upset the world with good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what we do when we legalize
and decriminalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is incumbent upon you not willing
to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a guarantee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need you to be a very good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here is a brief anecdote of a visit
I did on behalf of the History Channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pitched the History Channel a few years
ago to let me do a one hour documentary on
[SPEAKER_00]: the history of hemp and cannabis in
America so I can talk about bigotry and
[SPEAKER_00]: racism and the unjust way the legal system
puts people who smoke cannabis or use
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products down in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would be a lesson to the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some strange reason, they gave me the
budget and allowed me to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I found myself at the cannabis cup,
4th April 20th, 420 or 24 for you perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we're a History Channel,
we have our camera crews in there before
[SPEAKER_00]: the doors open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they open the door and the nine block
long 30,000 person throng comes running
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I was inside, I was watching
the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was watching how bored the cops were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the cops have nothing to enforce.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they're doing is giving back straight
frisbees and hacky sacks that keeps them
[SPEAKER_00]: kicking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cannabis fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the cops were bored at how well
mannered all these brightly colored,
[SPEAKER_00]: energetic, incredible young people were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they come running in and I'm
interviewing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at one point, I interviewed one
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, do you think there will be a
day when we won't have to have the 420
[SPEAKER_00]: event, the cannabis cup, because cannabis
will be legal all over America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be like having a celebration
for pizza, which is fine with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's nothing that you have to have a
convention about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone said, wow, that might be what
will be the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be the future of this century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you and I are going to make it so.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day, I went to a grow facility
the size of about a Walmart, about three
[SPEAKER_00]: miles on each side.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scientists who had cloned his plant to
grow all the plants inside that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: facility took me and my film crew about
three and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through this hydroponically grown
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he showed me the lights go on for six
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this light, four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this light, whatever, this stuff in the
water goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new fluid comes in.
And it was completely scientific.
Every plant was barcoded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the floors were clean of marijuana
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the scientists said,
do you notice there's nothing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, we care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we are inspected like every five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if our inspector sees any part of
cannabis on the floor, we can get closed
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are heavily regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I spent all day filming in rooms of
rows of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next day, about eight a.m.,
we went into the dispensary that's owned
[SPEAKER_00]: by this grow facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the part of the anecdote that
was really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went in, we filmed everybody behind the
counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single person on the staff was
dressed in a suit with a bow tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every different product had an iPad
next to it with a full explanation as to
[SPEAKER_00]: what that product would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a medium high, a very psychedelic
high, a gentle high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I interviewed everyone behind the
counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, so you are equipped to walk me
through every single product in this shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam and I, and I just want to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to tell me what to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, we know how to help you if
you have a health problem, if you just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to try this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have body pain, if you have
insomnia, we are here for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more than just selling products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are part of your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we finished filming them around
8.15 in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's time at nine a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: for the shop to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go outside and I'm waiting for the
camera crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take forever to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bundle up all their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 Pelican cases coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at the line, walking in to
the shop, waiting for 0900 hours for the
[SPEAKER_00]: shop to open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw an elderly couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some student-age young man with his
bike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a guy in a business suit,
well-dressed man with his blackberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I basically saw what looks like a New
York subway car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw all of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: The elderly, the young, the yummy business
go-getter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The student died.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one had fangs.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one had a horn coming out of their
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I really got it that
cannabis has a use for millions and
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's time to decriminalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my conviction grew and grew and grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's a brief history of how
cannabis became legal in America the same
[SPEAKER_00]: way it's becoming legal in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, many years ago, I lived on my state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like 1974, the Carter
administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my friends, his name was Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd go over to Ted's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd get a skateboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd waste all summer on skateboards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day we'd go to Ted's to pick him up,
to go skate.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would always show us these purple
joints that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't interested in smoking,
but I was interested in marijuana because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, where are you getting
marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: What evil underworld swine do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, your mom smokes marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had heard a word on the radio,
glaucoma, and that marijuana was something
[SPEAKER_00]: that could relieve the pain of glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ted's mother was on the system doled
out by the US government to get her
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana as medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went into the living room,
and she was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he showed us this plastic jar,
circular, with these joints inside,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 to a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, so what, you take your mom's
joints?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, oh no, she counts them,
but she doesn't smoke them all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I steal them from the ashtray,
and I smoke the other half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember I was like 15 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was really reprehensible
behavior because that's how I was trained
[SPEAKER_00]: by my father.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the right of my father's Fox News and a
wall of hopelessness.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tremendous misogynist, a record-breaking
home folk, and an amazing racist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: He should know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his idea was if you're gay or if you
smoke marijuana or if you're both,
[SPEAKER_00]: the empire will fall by noon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he had it drilled into my head that
no one but bad people smoke marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, Teddy, if you're going to get
in trouble, you'll become a bad person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, what's the matter with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I don't want to be with you
because that cost you to get us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he thought I was insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I got the wrong information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we have to give people the
right information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did cannabis get into America,
like I said, legally, is because of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the History Channel, with my
little documentary, we got to go to a
[SPEAKER_00]: famous Mississippi university called Ole
Miss that has the last legal grow facility
[SPEAKER_00]: the government has for the remaining
people who have been grandfathered in on
[SPEAKER_00]: their cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is guarded by this amazing fence that's
very, very high with rolled barbed razor
[SPEAKER_00]: wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is guarded 24 hours a day from the
students who've been trying to steal the
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I asked one of the guards,
I go, give me the most innovative ways the
[SPEAKER_00]: students have been trying to steal the
cannabis from over the fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, drones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fishing rods with hooks?
[SPEAKER_00]: One threw a monkey over the fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is desperate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we went in the field and we filmed
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were frisked going in, and we were
frisked going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, look, we know you haven't taken
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to frisk it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, go ahead, man, it's no
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting felt up by a large man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay, keep me awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most interesting part was the rest
of the afternoon that we spent in their
[SPEAKER_00]: storage facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they grow more product than they
know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have hashed oil that they
condense into hashed wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wax!
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can't even put a knife in it,
it's so dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have barrels of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have barrels of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here's the real tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this room, full of literally hundreds
of pounds of product, freezers full of
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen hash oil, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's a better term for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might know better than I.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in boxes were drug braided evidence
where they had gone into someone's house
[SPEAKER_00]: and taken their marijuana, which was in a
bag with all the evidence information on
[SPEAKER_00]: the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was Wyoming, July 15, 2015,
04, 17 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pulled bag after bag out of these
boxes and made a pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, can we film this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we filmed it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: With just tons of bags of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana that was seized as something
illegal that sits in the same room as
[SPEAKER_00]: legal cannabis that they don't have enough
people for because they're not re-helping
[SPEAKER_00]: this program like they used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a minute, the American government
cared about these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, as these states go legal,
slowly, for medical and then recreational,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we're eventually going to get here
in Germany, you see the struggle that even
[SPEAKER_00]: in this century, we still struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so medical is the way that cannabis is
becoming legal in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I hope you'll do is honor that,
respect it, and not treat it as a speed
[SPEAKER_00]: bump that gets you on your way to
recreational sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you retain the idea that cannabis,
a lot of people call cannabis medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they use it for all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start your store or whatever
you're going to do in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, as a favor to me, would you
please keep at the forefront the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of being good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goodness should be your guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that compass that keeps you going
forever in the right direction is the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of medical use for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get rich off this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm almost fairly certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The money will be easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how good are you if you're just a
rich, schmuck who doesn't care about
[SPEAKER_00]: people?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're going to make the money,
you might as well do something good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so retail must reflect this goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the government, I don't think
Angela Merkel, who's in charge for now,
[SPEAKER_00]: from what I've read, she's not really all
that happy about the idea of recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all have a struggle on your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not allowed to make cannabis in
this country yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're importing, right, from America,
from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know where else.
[SPEAKER_00]: America and Canada for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your markup is extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think that's a frown,
I can turn that upside down for you and
[SPEAKER_00]: turn that into a smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because every single one of you who is
from Germany and has to deal with the
[SPEAKER_00]: strictures and current laws of Germany,
you are immediately in on the ground floor
[SPEAKER_00]: of the new frontier that is cannabis in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the people in the entire country
sitting in this room right now who are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to lead it because you are smart
enough to get here first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was Merkel that got all of us in
this room at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if any of you were at the VIP
event last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex spoke for a little while and he
briefly mentioned that he did time in a
[SPEAKER_00]: German jail for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the guy did time for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got his ass kicked for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he'll be around all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really, he's a really sharp guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of admiration for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a lifelong do-gooder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done time for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what he knows, we are all in this
room now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot thank him enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, Merkel is the shoehorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Merkel got through Germany, Germany's law
system, which has one of the strictest
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotics laws systems in all of Europe,
if not the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're certainly not cutting your head
off for it, but you will do time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a very interesting and somewhat
frustrating conversation with a young
[SPEAKER_00]: journalist yesterday who arrived late,
which is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get places early because I put the
pumpkin punctual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he tried to play devil's advocate,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, why should we legalize cannabis
for recreational use in Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, man, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you playing devil's advocate so I
can work out my talking points on you?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, because life is short and people
want a new way to get off heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a way to relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a new way to have some fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not crystal methamphetamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not Kennedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not syringe drugs that will get you
killed either using them or curing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the many reasons that people
should have cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, but what if cannabis retailers
take out ads and young people see the ads?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that they see cannabis everywhere
anyway, and they're going to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, so what are you saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we legalize it and people then,
they'll all try it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, what do you think that leads
to?
[SPEAKER_00]: An epidemic?
[SPEAKER_00]: He went, and that's where I don't think he
really thought his talking points are
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: A whole country smoking marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, A, I don't think that would be the
worst idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And B, I don't think that would be the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he said, people in Germany are
stupid, and they won't be able to handle
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to talk badly of you who are
laying with your pants halfway down and
[SPEAKER_00]: your underwear is sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how your pants stayed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, stupid, you're the professor
who's breaking it down for me about how
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone else in this country is stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about getting on the idea that maybe
some people in this country need more
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need more information on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be enlightened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you can denigrate an entire
country and say they're stupid unless you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to talk about my country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so nice to be out there for just a
little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea that Germany in 2018
cannot handle cannabis is laughable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we go forward on this bold new
idea of legalized cannabis in Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to be at the forefront of the
information vending.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you open up your shop, if you're just
going to be someone who makes money
[SPEAKER_00]: selling products, in my opinion,
you are part of a problem and not part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the solution and the ongoing evolution of
this social experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like in my country, democracy is an
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some ups and downs, but it's still
rolling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you open your place,
I hope that you will be a vector of
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this word I keep using over and
over again, goodness, that is part of your
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the right of end, it does nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But darkness and hopelessness.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd be 90 something years of age.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gotta be some part of his body
that hurts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are to get him to come over to your
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to give out so much information
in your community that you can even get my
[SPEAKER_00]: dad, me man of German descent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't blame him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, you need to make him your
father.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's your first customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all the recreational people,
they will come with you easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the people who disagree with you who
you have to flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if it makes you feel any better,
this century is going to be the only
[SPEAKER_00]: century that you and I live through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has to be the one where we get it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a demographic shift in my country
and in your country.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I've been saying on stage in America
for the last few weeks, I've been on tour,
[SPEAKER_00]: I said there's going to come a time very
soon where there won't be anyone alive in
[SPEAKER_00]: America who will watch Fox News.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will literally be talking to no
one because I'm not wishing these people
[SPEAKER_00]: into an early grave.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are dying off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my country is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the marches in the streets for
young people who will be voting this
[SPEAKER_00]: November.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying no to guns and no to gun
violence and yes to peace and yes to gun
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation and yes to sanity and yes to
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you cannot convince these
people of homophobia, racism and any
[SPEAKER_00]: assorted awful ignorance or bigotry going
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be voting and they will be
changing my country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to be for the
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your country, you have a massive young
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone in this room is against
legalization and decriminalization of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope someone talking today changes your
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the raw facts are you are
outnumbered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are outnumbered by positive young and
old people who see the good in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's flash forward to the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, please, please do not let this be
just about money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The money's going to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you after you've made a million
dollars, the next five million dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: won't change your life that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hopefully you will have a good part
of what you do every day in the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis be for goodness and for changing
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said several minutes ago,
I travel all over the world by myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually just a camera and a backpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to be a goodwill
ambassador, not an American, just a fellow
[SPEAKER_00]: homo sapiens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just go anywhere I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many years ago, I went to Iran.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an American, as you know, my country
has a very complicated history with Iran.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it took me about three years to get
the visa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally I'm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to shake off my tour spy
who's assigned to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: By about 1300 hours every day,
I could get rid of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the tour guide away from me so I
can walk the streets of Tehran and meet
[SPEAKER_00]: Iranian people and make friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went into shops, convenience
stores that men are working about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I stand conspicuously long enough to
where people come over.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, are you lost?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, why are you here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I'm here to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Henry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, you're here to meet me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, I'm not lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came here to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you came all the way here to
meet me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've got to start getting along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need you to have some good American
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met one American.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why I travel the way I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just walk into places where I don't
see anyone who looks like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just walk in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I come with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You live in this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I come in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you drinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I have some?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has led to afternoon tea in
Lebanon, people inviting me into their
[SPEAKER_00]: tents, into their yurts, into their huts,
in slums, suits, bazaars, everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I care and because I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I think cannabis is all
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Alex said earlier, this is a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're just going to be raw
capitalists, I think we'll very quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: lose the plot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the idea of this being a
community, the idea of cannabis being a
[SPEAKER_00]: good thing, a healthy thing, that which
helps people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are going to be salespeople and
advocates for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's much more than the sales of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you're going up against big
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going up against big pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going up against every deep-seated
bigotry and ancient, stupid, ignorant
[SPEAKER_00]: thought that any western country has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are not, at least at some part
of your day, interested in offsetting that
[SPEAKER_00]: apple cart and wrecking it and never
getting wheels in any mobility again,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I think you're part of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to change your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to get some responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want you to be awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to do really good things with
this really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not for brave people standing up,
for me, cannabis is a civil rights issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what it has done to brown and black
people, poor people in my country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people rotting away in prisons
because they have an ass pocket of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing good about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing way too much time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's utterly ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just racism on a billboard in neon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if it's not for good people
standing up and doing the right thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are done with this century.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I hope that you're on board with
this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the rest of the day,
you're going to have people giving you the
[SPEAKER_00]: nuts and bolts and the mechanics and the
strategy and the policy of all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am your hearts and minds die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am begging you to do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna make the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you do good?
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time you're my age, 57,
I'll be dead in eight years in Paris,
[SPEAKER_00]: then at least you can say I did something
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I helped some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some money fine, but that's not
what I'm proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of my goodness, my decency,
and the fact that I looked to help other
[SPEAKER_00]: people in my community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that's what makes the cannabis
community a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said 30 minutes ago, I don't use
cannabis at all, but there might come a
[SPEAKER_00]: day when my doctor says, you're a
shriveled old man and you're shrinking and
[SPEAKER_00]: your bones are softening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in a great deal of pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're eating too much aspirin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to just go to the store and get
some of these gummy bears.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna write you a prescription so you
don't screw it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to start using a cannabis
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to sneak around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get a dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to go and get my medicine and
get on with my day and do my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while I'm not a user, I'm an
advocate because I've never seen the
[SPEAKER_00]: downside of cannabis except for greed and
meanness and bigotry and racism and a
[SPEAKER_00]: screwed up justice system in my country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to think that you and I are
the antithesis of that and the solution to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I'm going to leave you
to let true scholars of cannabis come onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for tolerating me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be back in Germany later this year
if I'm lucky, making my third time in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always feel very lucky when I'm in
Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear I'll be double you in 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a hopeless romantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whenever I'm in Berlin,
I must listen to Iggy Pop and David Bowie
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over again because they made my
life better and they did it here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been nice being in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
Thank you.
