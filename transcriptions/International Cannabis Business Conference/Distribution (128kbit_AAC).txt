[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hear me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks so much for having us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very privileged to introduce this
esteemed panel of licensed distributors in
[SPEAKER_03]: California with very diverse business
models, and this group here is,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, a really solid representation of
kind of the diversity in our market here
[SPEAKER_03]: in California, but many of them also have
kind of a global vision, a national
[SPEAKER_03]: vision, so I'm excited for them to get to
share that with you, and on this panel
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll really be talking about what makes
distribution work here in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that applies to most places
around the state, how we achieve kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: an efficient marketplace, and we'll talk
about the competitive and collaborative
[SPEAKER_03]: landscape for cannabis distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we get into all that,
love the opportunity to have you all
[SPEAKER_03]: introduce yourselves and share a little
bit about your company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Chris Coulombe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the CEO of Pacific Expeditors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a statewide distribution operation
that provides sales, warehouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: excuse me, warehousing, and logistics all
the way from Oregon border to San Diego.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: Felipe Recalde.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the SVP of technology and co-founder
of Rise Logistics.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do third-party logistics for brands
that have their own sales team,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then we have a full-service
distribution branch statewide that also
[SPEAKER_06]: provides for our portfolio brands that we
have sales as a service.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Wesley Hine, and I want to say
one thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is, without a doubt, the most
comfortable panel chair I have ever sat
[SPEAKER_08]: in.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm one of these.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad I'm not at the 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: panel, so I apologize for slouching.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm with Mammoth Distribution,
but before I get that, and I warn Lauren I
[SPEAKER_08]: might do this, is I often answer the
question not that was asked, but that I
[SPEAKER_08]: wish was asked, and I was at an earlier
panel, and they said something,
[SPEAKER_08]: which was, if you've taken the time,
energy, and money to come to this,
[SPEAKER_08]: and you haven't reached out to your
senators or your congressmen or your
[SPEAKER_08]: elected officials and asked them,
pleaded with them, demanded them to
[SPEAKER_08]: address whatever ills are faced in your
jurisdiction, whether it's 280E,
[SPEAKER_08]: total illegality or whatever, then you
have it backwards, and that's something
[SPEAKER_08]: that I implore you as I implore myself to
address right away, and when you get back,
[SPEAKER_08]: start reaching out to those people.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we need, as much as
distribution.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, for distribution, we're Mammoth
Distribution.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're a pretty good size.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have six licenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing we do is a little different,
is that instead of carrying a variety of
[SPEAKER_08]: products, we focus on just one,
which is vape.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not to say that we don't think the
other categories are important.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just with all of the changes and
advocacy and education that is necessary
[SPEAKER_08]: in this market of tumult, we felt that
we'd be best served by just focusing on
[SPEAKER_08]: one thing and trying to do that really
well, and we carry five currently brands,
[SPEAKER_08]: vape brands.
[SPEAKER_08]: All distinct, our flagship brand is called
Heavy Hitters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Michael Steinmetz.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the CEO and one of the founders of
Flocona.
[SPEAKER_07]: Best way to describe Flocona is we are a
supply chain company that focuses
[SPEAKER_07]: exclusively with small farmers from the
Emerald Triangle on these sun-grown,
[SPEAKER_07]: organic, sustainable products.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have two big components to our
business.
[SPEAKER_07]: One is an upstream processing and
manufacturing, and then we have a
[SPEAKER_07]: downstream distribution company.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the distribution side, we've got a hub
in San Diego, two hubs in LA, Sacramento,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the Bay Area, so about five hubs
across the state.
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the upstream side of things,
we have a couple aggregation hubs and kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of densely populated areas where farmers
are.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one in Southern Humboldt,
one in Northern Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're opening a third one in Southern
Mendocino as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we, about two years ago, bought the
Fetzer Winery in Ukiah, and we're turning
[SPEAKER_07]: it into a centralized processing center to
provide all the services at scale for the
[SPEAKER_07]: small farmers so they can cultivate their
product, dry it and cure it on-farm,
[SPEAKER_07]: the state cured, and then we do everything
else, the trimming, the processing,
[SPEAKER_07]: the packaging, manufacturing, and then the
downstream distribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's kick off with a really kind of
open-ended first question, which is,
[SPEAKER_03]: tell us about the distribution landscape
in California and what that looks like,
[SPEAKER_03]: and maybe incorporate some of the ways in
which distributors work with one another
[SPEAKER_03]: and work within the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, let's see, Mikey, would you mind
kicking us off?
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a challenging time in
California, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's about as many distributors as
there are licensed retailers.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a one-to-one ratio.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also emerging from a world where a
lot of distributors did, or a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: brands, because there didn't exist a
distribution network in the past,
[SPEAKER_07]: have built their own self-distribution
components to their business.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there's a lot of us in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_07]: I say it's a pretty amicable and
collaborative environment, but I wish it
[SPEAKER_07]: was more collaborative, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's an interesting time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this year is probably going to
bring about a lot of consolidation in the
[SPEAKER_07]: industry, both on the brand side and the
distribution side.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be interesting to see how it
all kind of shakes out and who the winners
[SPEAKER_07]: are that emerge.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as this industry matures and more
cultivation comes online, the margins
[SPEAKER_07]: compress, and distribution is not a very
easy game, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: When you have to do it in this regulatory
landscape, tons of rules, very high capex
[SPEAKER_07]: investments on the real estate,
on the truck side.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I think what we're going to see this
year is, unfortunately, probably some
[SPEAKER_07]: distributors disappearing or joining
forces with other people, because it's
[SPEAKER_07]: definitely not enough room for the number
of distributors that exist today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, that's one of the things that we're
working on consciously is actually trying
[SPEAKER_07]: to come together with a lot of
distribution companies and kind of protect
[SPEAKER_07]: the California values and the California
brands that for so long have been part of
[SPEAKER_07]: this industry and finding ways to work
together more intimately.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think it's difficult to talk about
the distribution environment in 2019
[SPEAKER_08]: without going back to 2017, because
notwithstanding the comment I say to
[SPEAKER_08]: people all the time, we're like any other
distribution company in any other
[SPEAKER_08]: industry, in 2017, we couldn't be like any
other distribution company, because if we
[SPEAKER_08]: distributed and actually distributed,
that was called trafficking.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was very illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, instead, what we did was we formed
mutual benefit corporations, cooperatives,
[SPEAKER_08]: non-profit, and we facilitated transaction
amongst members, member patients of the
[SPEAKER_08]: collective.
[SPEAKER_08]: Try putting that on your LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, we had this, that was the
downside.
[SPEAKER_08]: The upside was we had a couple of thousand
potential clients to sell to in terms of
[SPEAKER_08]: retailers and dispensary and delivery
services.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then on 1-1 2018, boom, that got cut by
about 75% to just a few hundred.
[SPEAKER_08]: That type of tumult was very difficult to
navigate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we reoriented our business and
reoriented the brands and so forth towards
[SPEAKER_08]: now, this segment started building those.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to July 1st, a date all of us will
remember here.
[SPEAKER_08]: The BCC told retailers, okay, as of July
1, if we catch you with any noncompliant
[SPEAKER_08]: inventory, you're in trouble.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, hilarity ensued, because 350 or so
licensed retailers each had a different
[SPEAKER_08]: opinion as to what compliance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Noncompliant inventory was.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that appropriate contrasting color?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the lower third and so forth?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, navigating all of that,
and then we almost had, again,
[SPEAKER_08]: at the end of the year with the heavy
metal testing where let's test all
[SPEAKER_08]: products for heavy metal, but let's only
have a few labs that are really up to the
[SPEAKER_08]: task.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, these are the things that we dealt
with in 2018.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that we're getting to 2019,
we've overcome those.
[SPEAKER_08]: We now have permanent regulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most people think permanent means they're
not going to change.
[SPEAKER_08]: Permanent in this case means they're going
to change, but apparently a little bit
[SPEAKER_08]: more slowly according to the BCC,
and that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I think all of the things that my
fellow distributor on the right said is
[SPEAKER_08]: exactly right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to see increased competition.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to see the types of things
that probably would have expected last
[SPEAKER_08]: year, but we were just dealing with the
tumult.
[SPEAKER_03]: If no other comments, we can move on to
the next question, which is related.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, what are some of your big takeaways
from 2018, really as it pertains to what
[SPEAKER_03]: makes a winning partnership between
producers and distributors and or
[SPEAKER_03]: retailers and distributors?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, really thinking out about it from a
perspective of what makes partnerships
[SPEAKER_03]: work in this new environment that we're
all in, in a new regulated environment
[SPEAKER_03]: with all those changes that Wesley
outlined.
[SPEAKER_03]: Philippe, would you like to start?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we look at partnership very much so
that we are in this lane of distribution,
[SPEAKER_06]: and brands can focus on their
manufacturing or their cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, for us, being able to provide the
services with a very specific focus and
[SPEAKER_06]: being the most efficient partner possible,
we're flexible around the partnership.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if brands want to represent
themselves, we're of the belief that
[SPEAKER_06]: nobody tells their story better than
themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we allow the brands to go out and
build their sales teams and rep
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves, and then if they're ready to
share the story and allow us to go out and
[SPEAKER_06]: represent, then we've got sales as a
service, and we'll build a team.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really get to know the brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know what drives them, what their DNA
is like, and we're out on the field
[SPEAKER_06]: wearing their gear day in and day out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of pride in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, just furthering Philippe's
comments, it's also understanding that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have our own very specific and respective
function, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're all basically standing there on the
same team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, what that means is we don't look
at why this person should be in a store
[SPEAKER_02]: and this person should not be in a store.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really making sure that whatever it
is that you put together as a plan is very
[SPEAKER_02]: well defined and well executed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, the main point is making
sure that everybody is relying on their
[SPEAKER_02]: core competencies and that you very well
understand what those respective core
[SPEAKER_02]: competencies are.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that also means we work together a
lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we call each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: We end up working with different clients.
[SPEAKER_06]: After SB311 passed, thank you,
Lauren, we've been able to do distributor
[SPEAKER_06]: to distributor transactions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's opened up to some of the local
aggregators and various regions of the
[SPEAKER_06]: state that are further out to partner up,
source, get everything retail ready,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then we do the last mile delivery for
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other big takeaways in terms of what
makes a winning partnership?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we could probably do the entire
panel on that, but I think it's really
[SPEAKER_08]: understanding and I'm building on what
Philippe had said.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's mutual dependence.
[SPEAKER_08]: No matter how good a distributor is at
logistics, it's out of business if it
[SPEAKER_08]: doesn't have good products and it doesn't
make those products.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, brands have a tremendous amount of
leverage on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That said, if a brand has products and
it's not in a dispensary and does not have
[SPEAKER_08]: a good footprint in those dispensaries,
it's out of business.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it's really looking for the areas
where they can work together and
[SPEAKER_08]: collaborate.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the number one thing a distributor
should ask its brands is how can we do a
[SPEAKER_08]: better job of representing your products.
[SPEAKER_08]: The number one thing the brands should ask
their distributors is what are you hearing
[SPEAKER_08]: from dispensaries about our products,
our packaging, our messaging that we can
[SPEAKER_08]: improve to make your job easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about what is a distributor's
role in the supply chain beyond some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the kind of logistical and functional
things that you've mentioned and kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: around the idea of their role in terms of
creating demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a distributor's role to create
demand or does that fall more on the brand
[SPEAKER_03]: or is it a shared effort?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could speak to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think to the point made earlier,
there's different kinds of relationships
[SPEAKER_07]: with the different brands and different
distributors of different models.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think besides the logistics,
besides the sale, besides transportation,
[SPEAKER_07]: warehousing, the traditional functions,
we're also the state's tax collection
[SPEAKER_07]: agency.
[SPEAKER_07]: I consider ourselves also kind of an
information hub.
[SPEAKER_07]: We kind of sit in the middle of
cultivators, manufacturers, retailers,
[SPEAKER_07]: delivery services.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know all of those pain points and we
take it upon ourselves to really help all
[SPEAKER_07]: the other pieces of the supply chain and
some of the trade organizations that we
[SPEAKER_07]: sit on the boards, CCIA and the others.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in general, the relationship with
the distributor to really build
[SPEAKER_07]: marketplace, speaking about ourselves,
we're not trying to be a large catalog
[SPEAKER_07]: distributor with thousands of products.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to build an intimate relationship
with a select few of curated,
[SPEAKER_07]: category-winning brands.
[SPEAKER_07]: We try to find and associate ourselves
with brands that, for one, can scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of people are struggling with
scaling beyond the real estate that
[SPEAKER_07]: they're in or with lack of capital.
[SPEAKER_07]: We find the right brands that have that
ability to scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they don't have it themselves,
we love the brand or love the founding
[SPEAKER_07]: team, we try to help them with the capital
and we try to help them with our real
[SPEAKER_07]: estate footprint as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in terms of developing the
marketplace, we do have a very close
[SPEAKER_07]: relationship with the brands where we
actually help them with a lot of the
[SPEAKER_07]: marketing activities.
[SPEAKER_07]: We run merchandising teams.
[SPEAKER_07]: We run brand ambassador teams for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have specific campaigns that we do
together collaboratively with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: A distributor's success really depends
entirely on the brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're linked by the hip.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's very important for that
relationship to be win-win.
[SPEAKER_07]: The distributors, in our case,
we are building a lot of market share for
[SPEAKER_07]: the brands we work with, but we also
leverage a lot of their marketing
[SPEAKER_07]: campaigns that they do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if all the other distributors
are the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aside from the tax collection,
we have another huge responsibility is to
[SPEAKER_06]: make sure that the products are safe for
the consumers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing all of the quality assurance,
making sure it's labeled appropriately and
[SPEAKER_06]: in compliant packaging to go to market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other responsibilities and functions that
we have is to actually give back the
[SPEAKER_06]: brands that we work with analytics,
visibility to what's happening in the
[SPEAKER_06]: marketplace so that they can make the
right decisions.
[SPEAKER_06]: About what their next SKUs should be or
how much inventory to have on hand or any
[SPEAKER_06]: demand-based analytics that could help
them drive their business to success.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing really worth emphasizing is,
and we're very proud of our distribution
[SPEAKER_08]: company, but at no time ever in the
history of the cannabis industry has
[SPEAKER_08]: anybody ever walked into a dispensary and
said, I would like a mammoth distribution
[SPEAKER_08]: product.
[SPEAKER_08]: What mammoth distribution products do you
have?
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand they're legit.
[SPEAKER_08]: The logistics is amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're there behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know we need to get it in.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to have the footprint.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to educate, but at the end of the
day, it is the power of the brand because
[SPEAKER_08]: you might be able to get somebody to try
something once.
[SPEAKER_08]: Often, we're not able to get something in
a dispensary without the bud tenders and
[SPEAKER_08]: the managers and the buyers trying it and
going, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think other people will like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can get people potentially to try
something once, but if they don't come
[SPEAKER_08]: back and ask for it, then you're not going
to be able to keep it in that dispensary
[SPEAKER_08]: and then it's going to be very hard to get
it into other dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we always want to go back as first and
foremost, just have a great product.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to be compliant because otherwise
it doesn't even get in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Retailers have gotten very good and very
discerning to the point of being kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: crazy in some cases, but to make sure that
they feel that it's passed every single
[SPEAKER_08]: aspect of what they consider compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just echo whatever what everyone
else has said.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's effectively being a leveraging
platform or an enabling platform,
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that PacEx did is we
sponsored a large consumption event and we
[SPEAKER_02]: paid for every single one of our brands to
come down and sit in front of the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we sponsored the Emerald Cup and we
paid for all 21 brands that we represent
[SPEAKER_02]: to sit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We covered the expense of that event so
that they could be there in front of all
[SPEAKER_02]: of their customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And get that real-time feedback to
understand what the market really is,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the consumers are looking for,
the dialogue between the consumers and the
[SPEAKER_02]: retailers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being able to do that, I think,
in various ways across platforms,
[SPEAKER_02]: across the state is really what we do as
distributors beyond all of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: technicalities that we have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really being a leveraging platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what advice do you have for brands?
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of getting them ready for
distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure you, you know, brands reach
out or producers reach out and they are
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for a distributor and they may or
may not be a right fit for you based on
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever criteria you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what would you tell brands that you
look for and that you expect before
[SPEAKER_03]: they're really ready for a distribution
partner?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, I'm happy to start off.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I guess the first advice would be
make sure you like your distribution
[SPEAKER_07]: partner.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, at the end of the day,
companies are built with people and you
[SPEAKER_07]: got to make sure you get along well with
that organization and you're kind of value
[SPEAKER_07]: aligned and mission aligned and kind of
what you're trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, one thing we know for certain in
this industry, it's that even though we're
[SPEAKER_07]: in this permanent regulation phase,
it's going to change and change and change
[SPEAKER_07]: and change.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have problem after problem
after hiccup after hiccup.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have to work through those.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we've had a lot of challenges
with packaging and labeling and different
[SPEAKER_07]: changes and different perspectives and
different dispensaries and working through
[SPEAKER_07]: those I think is one of the most important
things you can do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think from a distributor perspective,
picking the right one that has the scale
[SPEAKER_07]: to really serve, you know, the entire
state or specific regions if you want to
[SPEAKER_07]: divvy it up with different people,
making sure they have the right amount of
[SPEAKER_07]: capital to continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Distribution is a super capital intensive
game and especially to do it at scale at
[SPEAKER_07]: the pace that California needs it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think ensuring that the distributor
that you choose is going to be around for
[SPEAKER_07]: the long term and, you know, you're
working with people that you kind of want
[SPEAKER_07]: to work with on a day to day basis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, two simple rules.
[SPEAKER_08]: And do your homework.
[SPEAKER_08]: Distributors are different.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you're going to a distributor
and their emphasis on the medicinal and
[SPEAKER_08]: yours is on the party, it might not be a
good fit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure if you're bringing a product to
them that your packaging is compliant
[SPEAKER_08]: because if you come in and it's got all
sorts of medical claims and so forth,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're going to think this is going to be
a lot more work working with these people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure your product has been tested
before in coming in because the one thing
[SPEAKER_08]: about distributors, the distribution model
generally is a sort of a game of a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: You carry a number of brands, a number of
different SKUs.
[SPEAKER_08]: That means you're dealing with a lot of
different people and competing interests.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if one tries to be the tall blade and
dominate the time, it really can make it
[SPEAKER_08]: difficult for everything else.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think what he says is exactly right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Never underestimate the people concept.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody might like your product but as
you're leaving they're sitting there
[SPEAKER_08]: thinking I don't want to have to deal with
this guy or this gal.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not going to serve you well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would recommend having a business plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people slap a label on a package
and say this is my brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: So actually, you know, have some
forecasting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Figure out how much inventory.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have projections of what you'd like to
sell when you get out to market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that will help all of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, the packaging, because the
majority of packaging that comes through
[SPEAKER_06]: shows up the first revision.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've already ordered tons of it and
we're looking at it and it's all wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hire an attorney.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have them look at the packaging or get a
compliance person.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then come talk to a distributor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure that they approve your
packaging.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the big final thing that I would
say if you want to go to market is read
[SPEAKER_06]: the regulations or at least have somebody
that read them because a lot of companies
[SPEAKER_06]: have not read them and we spend a lot of
time educating the companies or the brands
[SPEAKER_06]: to work with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would agree with what everyone has
said.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other component would be really think
about what you're getting ready to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are launching a brand, that's not
just a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to create a message.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to create a vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to communicate that out to the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, going back to the enabling
platform, you create marketing plans for
[SPEAKER_02]: your products.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pull your distributor into that,
particularly when you're receiving some
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of sales service from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we noticed on the front end when we
brought on a lot of the small legacy
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers, the small batch farmers,
is that we were investing somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: between $20,000 and $40,000 per brand that
we brought on just trying to build
[SPEAKER_02]: momentum for them in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another thing that needs to be
understood from people, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: from brands or from entities that are
trying to create brands in the market is
[SPEAKER_02]: that this is a heavily congested space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody is here attempting to sell
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need to not only have these
differentiators and so on, but you also
[SPEAKER_02]: need to have a message that will resonate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to understand that for
something to resonate, it takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: X amount of impressions for someone to
recall.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you expect to show up to a
distributor on, say, a Friday and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to pick up your inventory,
don't expect sales on Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you guys have had my product for
three days now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the market?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the market intelligence?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my money?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big thing is making sure that there's
a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back to some of the earlier comments
that were made, you've got to really show
[SPEAKER_02]: up with a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to understand that this is a
team.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a huge team effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a huge team event.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to have a marketing plan,
communicate that to your distributor
[SPEAKER_02]: because they can show up and they can be
the sales team that backs up whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: collateral media that you're putting out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all coordinated efforts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the things that
distributors have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do the education.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do the review.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do the compliance check.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do logistics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do hand holding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do everything to get something to
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best way to see a distributor is as a
synthesizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to take chaos and we have to
turn it into something palatable and
[SPEAKER_02]: adjustable on the retail side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And understand that it's something that
needs to be worked through.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different ways to go about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's only a handful of them that
are correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've all alluded to various different
services and value propositions that these
[SPEAKER_03]: different business models have and may
offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's certainly a selection of different
services depending on the distributor a
[SPEAKER_03]: brand might go and work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do we place a value on those
services as a whole or individually?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know some business models are kind of a
la carte.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can leverage certain aspects of
what a distributor has to offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And others are more comprehensive in terms
of a flat rate for kind of the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: package.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've heard rates anywhere from 5%
to 10% when you're talking about just
[SPEAKER_03]: straight transportation.
[SPEAKER_03]: 10% to 20% if it's a combination of
transport and warehousing logistics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as high as 20, 25, 30% for that full
service warehousing logistics and sales
[SPEAKER_03]: and brand support.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what would you say is the appropriate
value for those services?
[SPEAKER_03]: And to give people an expectation of how
they would approach a conversation with a
[SPEAKER_03]: distributor but also how to evaluate one
distributor from the next based on the
[SPEAKER_03]: service that they're getting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that should be answered by anyone
other than me right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the first things is making
sure that you, going back to Felipe's
[SPEAKER_02]: point, understand the rules and then ask
your distributor if they understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's many times where we've had to
explain the law to another distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what you should do is find
certain points that you want to ask them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to do a competency test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm basically trusting this person to,
I'm putting my wellbeing in this person's
[SPEAKER_02]: hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have done everything I can to create a
high quality representation of what I
[SPEAKER_02]: believe is the best product out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to give you the best of what
I've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I know whether or not you can give
me the best that you can reciprocate?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to be able to know that these
people are technically competent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't have to question whether or
not they can do logistics.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can't do the logistics,
then that should be a short conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: From there, I think it's really
understanding their sales makeup.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it that they can do for me on the
sales front?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they going to provide demo services?
[SPEAKER_02]: And recognizing how much of that you need
to lean on them for and how much of that
[SPEAKER_02]: you plan to do yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a negotiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should see it as an open negotiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Saying I'm going to bring, I the brand,
I'm going to bring my sales team,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I just need your demo.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd say you're going to see price
points start to get a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to say whether or not
they'll go up or down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think with the consolidation that's
going to happen, you're going to see some
[SPEAKER_02]: of them go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of the technically
proficient operators are going to remain
[SPEAKER_02]: and those that are not proficient are
going to disappear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that space is going to get a lot more
complicated as we continue to evolve this
[SPEAKER_02]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be more retail outlets.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be more delivery
services.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually, there's going to be long
hauls headed out to other states.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, at the end of the day,
you want to understand how capable that
[SPEAKER_02]: team is that you're relying on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they are competent, you should
really expect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually pretty hard to explain how
many different things the distributors
[SPEAKER_02]: have to do that really a brand doesn't see
on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But expect that when you walk into these
negotiations, that number is going to land
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere around 20% to 25% for full
service.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you should show up with as a
budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: 25% should be what you expect in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anything that you get below that is a
win.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say look at the contract.
[SPEAKER_06]: So after you've gotten to see the
facility, meet some of the team,
[SPEAKER_06]: look over their distribution services
agreement.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can tell a lot about a company just by
reading that agreement.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've actually talked about standardizing
the distribution contracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very easy for you to read and
compare distributor to distributor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully, that'll happen in the
upcoming year or this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that would be probably another
great thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can all have just like real estate,
where you look at the form, it's in the
[SPEAKER_06]: same place no matter which mortgage
company you worked with or which realtor
[SPEAKER_06]: you worked with.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also important to note that if your
brand is doing $100,000 a month,
[SPEAKER_08]: that maybe even taking 50%, the person's
going to be losing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet if you're doing a couple of million
dollars a month, it might be 10% is too
[SPEAKER_08]: much.
[SPEAKER_08]: So kind of either breaking it down so
there's flat fees or there's breaks on
[SPEAKER_08]: percentages or so forth.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, a lot of it really depends on
how much work you're asking them to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason I was dodging the question
a little earlier is we have a little bit
[SPEAKER_08]: different model.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's certainly not going to say it's a
better model or an inferior model.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the one we take, which is every
brand that we work with, we've invested in
[SPEAKER_08]: and taken an equity position.
[SPEAKER_08]: One is because we want them to have the
resources.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if we're out there distributing,
and we go to them and say, it would be
[SPEAKER_08]: great if you did X, Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to look across the table and
say, well, we don't have the money.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go sell some stuff and then we can do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The second and the more important thing is
that we wanted the long-term interest to
[SPEAKER_08]: be aligned.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we want to make it where if they're
successful, we're successful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Similarly, if they're cut, we bleed.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a distributor, sometimes what happens,
I call this the distribution paradox for
[SPEAKER_08]: brands.
[SPEAKER_08]: A distributor goes in there, they're
carrying your brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the dispensary says, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't think we're going to carry this
one, but we're going to carry this other
[SPEAKER_08]: one from you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for that salesperson there,
they've made their commission.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really tough on them to say,
no, no, no, thank you for that order,
[SPEAKER_08]: but so forth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they're just trying to keep that
footprint and so forth.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yet from the brand's point of view,
you don't want the distributor to come
[SPEAKER_08]: back, go good news, bad news.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bad news is they're not carrying you
anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good news is they're carrying something
else we distribute.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's how we went ahead and tried to
address it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Others have addressed it in other ways.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we look again to make an investment in
an equity position.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just occurred to me that you should
also look at their brand portfolio to see
[SPEAKER_06]: how you rank amongst the other brands that
they carry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it make sense for you to work with
this distributor?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have other brands that would
cannibalize that piece of your business?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would add that 20% to 25% number is
for a brand new brand without any history.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have history, as stated,
that obviously gives you a great deal more
[SPEAKER_02]: leverage and negotiating power.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also makes things a lot more cut and
dry for the distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to that end, you should really do
whatever you can to see what demand there
[SPEAKER_02]: is for your product in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then start talking to distributors
again as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to show up without a very
good understanding or at least some form
[SPEAKER_02]: of context for your brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to show up in the market
because we have people that show up and
[SPEAKER_02]: they had some contracted product that they
don't really know about and don't believe
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, OK, make this big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe talk to somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, our last question, and then we'll
open it up for some Q&A.
[SPEAKER_03]: What role do you think that California
brands and distributors will have in this
[SPEAKER_03]: national and global market that is
emerging?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do you think that timeline looks
like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you personally have a vision for that,
for your company, or some of the brands
[SPEAKER_03]: you work with?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the conversation right now around
expanding state to state, the concept of
[SPEAKER_03]: interstate commerce opening up,
and even global?
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, ideally, we'd want interstate
commerce to open up because we have one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the greatest producing states in the
nation.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for now, since we have the world to
work within the confines of each state and
[SPEAKER_06]: the regulations, California has
established probably one of the best
[SPEAKER_06]: frameworks when you look at the
regulations in the other states.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one was clearly guided by people that
had been in the industry for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a vision for being able to
have a platform to take your brand into
[SPEAKER_06]: multiple states.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're produced here and distributed
here to provide that same experience in
[SPEAKER_06]: another state, that's something that if
you want to build a big national brand,
[SPEAKER_06]: you need.
[SPEAKER_06]: So from distribution, I think we have a
responsibility to build that multi-state
[SPEAKER_06]: platform.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stated simply, California is the largest
and I think most important cannabis market
[SPEAKER_08]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is what Hollywood is to movies,
what New York City is to publishing,
[SPEAKER_08]: what Paris and Rome is to fashion.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's a very big and expensive and
difficult state to win.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you can, that will help you in the
other states.
[SPEAKER_08]: That will help you in other countries more
than, let's say, having a winning brand in
[SPEAKER_08]: Massachusetts or Florida and then bring it
in into California.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so on a pragmatic basis, that means as
you're allocating, if you're in multiple
[SPEAKER_08]: states and you're allocating marketing
budgets, it's worth to allocate more to
[SPEAKER_08]: California than you might otherwise do
because it really will help on your
[SPEAKER_08]: licensing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we see that on the basis of just in
twofold.
[SPEAKER_08]: One is the number of queries that we get
from other states people wanting to
[SPEAKER_08]: license.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was somebody from Bang earlier
this morning and people were saying,
[SPEAKER_08]: we want to license you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he said, well, that's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: But why do you want us?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said, because people ask for your
product in this other state.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that speaks volumes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think just to echo some of the
sentiments here, California for sure is
[SPEAKER_07]: the most important market of the nation
and probably the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: California also produces two thirds of the
nation's fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think when statewide borders come
down, all cultivation moves down here,
[SPEAKER_07]: manufacturing moves to California too.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to be shipping biomass to
other states to be manufactured.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything will be really close to the
biomass.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the way we think about national
expansion is hyper focused on California.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're building massive scale on our
upstream operations, building
[SPEAKER_07]: relationships with the farmers,
helping them a lot with their accounting
[SPEAKER_07]: services, their compliance services,
their legal services.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've also partnered with an amazing lab
called Cascadia Labs at our facility and
[SPEAKER_07]: offering really large bulk discounts to
our farmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So finding ways for them to stay in the
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_07]: And building that infrastructure so that
when the states do come online or the
[SPEAKER_07]: statewide borders do disappear,
we're ready for that national expansion.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the portfolio that we're building is a
very curated set of very desirable
[SPEAKER_07]: California brands that have California
values at heart.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to support the sun grown
ecosystem, the small farmer ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_07]: really the people that kind of build this
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we feel that building that really
large portfolio here in California,
[SPEAKER_07]: putting those in the top ranking spots
across all their categories, and really
[SPEAKER_07]: waiting for that moment.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the Canadian public markets have
created an artificial market dynamics
[SPEAKER_07]: where people think they can put flags in
other states and use that to raise more
[SPEAKER_07]: money and raise more capital.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of people are going to be
cut with a lot of small little assets in a
[SPEAKER_07]: bunch of little locations and not really
building for the scale when the time
[SPEAKER_07]: comes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we're really focused on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say as goes California,
so goes the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we kind of premised a lot
of our business design on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understanding that once we get California
dialed in, we can pretty well assume that
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever structure is adopted at the
federal level is probably going to look
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhat similar to California.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are developing the precedent.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the opportunity to establish a
very large system that allows us to
[SPEAKER_02]: provide proof of concept to the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_02]: And likely we'll have a fair segment of it
adopted at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for our operation, we are designed to
scale not only nationally but
[SPEAKER_02]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we did is invested heavily on our
warehouse management system on the front
[SPEAKER_02]: end, ensuring that the ability to scale is
not limited by our systems, but merely by
[SPEAKER_02]: our creativity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say thank you to our panelists,
all members of the Cannabis Distribution
[SPEAKER_03]: Association.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Pacific Expeditors, Rise
Logistics, Mammoth Distribution,
[SPEAKER_03]: and Flocona.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I encourage you to reach out to these
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do we have time for questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have time for one or two quick
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here I come.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on my way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caller, are you there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris Conrad here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just wondering in terms of
distribution system, do we see the same
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of competition for shelf space in the
cannabis industries you like to see at the
[SPEAKER_05]: grocery stores or whatever where they're
fighting for that right at the exit and so
[SPEAKER_05]: forth?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how does that work out in distributor
versus people trying to do on their own
[SPEAKER_05]: and so forth?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd just like to address that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing preventing slotting in the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, shelf space is being bought and
sold and traded and all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's extremely competitive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also look at it like the almost like the
pharmaceutical reps that would go and hit
[SPEAKER_06]: a doctor.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to think there's almost one
distributor for every retail store right
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I were going to say anything that we
need to focus on in California,
[SPEAKER_06]: in 2019, it's bring on more retail.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of consumers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a lot more retail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a really small footprint in the stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like a grocery store that you
have a lot of shelf space to offer to
[SPEAKER_03]: begin with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the footprint's much smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: Question over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like more and more distributors
are sort of building their own proprietary
[SPEAKER_04]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems as you said, there's a tremendous
amount of expenses already with being a
[SPEAKER_04]: distributor and even more trying to build
your own proprietary software.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you sort of bridge the gap
between what you build yourselves and what
[SPEAKER_04]: you buy?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, my assumption is you want to be a
distributor, not a software company.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an interesting question,
actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we took a very unique and different
approach from day one to actually bring a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of our technology in-house.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think to your point, for sure,
people that are doing purely distribution,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a lot of software out there that
does warehouse management, route
[SPEAKER_07]: optimization, whatever you call it.
[SPEAKER_07]: For us specifically, and I definitely
don't want to speak for the crowd,
[SPEAKER_07]: we're very deeply connected with our
supply chain and our partners.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a lot of technology and a lot
of tools for our farmers to onboard their
[SPEAKER_07]: inventory, to view their inventory,
to see what products are selling and which
[SPEAKER_07]: locations and which stores and which
regions.
[SPEAKER_07]: We give them ideas of what to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to try to turn our supply chain to
being what it is today that farmers grow
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever they want and then we have to
figure out how to sell it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want to basically use our data and
our tools to really inform the upstream
[SPEAKER_07]: production so that we're actually doing
demand production rather than whatever the
[SPEAKER_07]: farmer wants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we build a lot of our technology
in-house with the way we kind of look at
[SPEAKER_07]: business and generally at Flokana as we
look at the world and we make our own
[SPEAKER_07]: hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes those hypotheses are proven and
disproven and we look ahead and try to
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of figure out what the next
bottlenecks are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lab testing was a huge bottleneck that we
have in this industry today.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we made a deep partnership with
the lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see technology and a lot of this
software's out there tracking multiple
[SPEAKER_07]: states and multiple jurisdictions and
multiple regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we always thought that technology was
going to be very hard for us to scale,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially how complex our model is,
to really be able to depend on other
[SPEAKER_07]: people to make the changes that California
will require.
[SPEAKER_07]: So specifically for us, because we're so
deeply connected to our farmer base all
[SPEAKER_07]: the way to our retailers, it made a lot of
strategic sense for us to build our own
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: We felt a little bit similar tact and a
little bit different from some of the
[SPEAKER_08]: probably smarter people on this panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is very hard to be a good
distributor and so we felt we should put
[SPEAKER_08]: the focus in that the same way that I
don't think I would go to a Microsoft and
[SPEAKER_08]: ask them to distribute cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we look for people who their sole focus
is developing amazing software and then
[SPEAKER_08]: look to leverage and work on their
efforts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have the opposite take.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you work with a software company and
a product manager to design software about
[SPEAKER_06]: something very specific, it's really
challenging for them to make it as
[SPEAKER_06]: efficient as you can if you are both
software and an operator.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other aspect related to this is a lot
of the companies that build software are
[SPEAKER_06]: either publicly traded, they're venture
capital funded, and we've seen them decide
[SPEAKER_06]: overnight, hey, we cannot provide services
to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So until the federal legalities changes,
you're at risk if you're running on
[SPEAKER_06]: someone else's platform that one day could
say, you know what, we don't want to do
[SPEAKER_06]: this anymore, you're done.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you tell your clients in that
state?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we believe that we should own our
platform and build it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In regard to the brands, the small farmer
brands that have taken some investment up
[SPEAKER_00]: front to build that brand, how do you
foresee Appalachian rights factoring into
[SPEAKER_00]: that and whether or not it will become
easier to support the branding for small
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers when it comes to distribution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it sounds like there's,
as someone said, a lot of traffic and lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of players and hard to enter as a small
farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is what's the,
do you identify there to be value in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Appalachians or?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you see Appalachian rights
factoring in and perhaps, I mean I guess I
[SPEAKER_00]: have my own viewpoint, easing the ability
for an emerging brand or small farmer to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to cut through some of the traffic
and distinguish themselves because they
[SPEAKER_00]: have Appalachian of origin or some other
protected category that I know people are
[SPEAKER_00]: working on that potentially could assist
these brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: How powerful is an Appalachian,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a small business but you get
to call it Humboldt Grown or Mendocino
[SPEAKER_01]: Gold, does that give you more sway in the
marketplace?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would put every effort that you could
into creating Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you can create a recognizable
and unique identifier to your brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean if you look at somebody who's
creating something from Stag's Leap Vice
[SPEAKER_02]: Rutherford, those abilities to identify
very high-end production regions,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is easily something that creates
differentiation and identifies a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: level of value, not only for the manner in
which you produce it, all the way through
[SPEAKER_02]: to the connection that a consumer has to
that particular region.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Appalachians is a very,
very valuable initiative that should be
[SPEAKER_02]: furthered and it will definitely change
the scene of cannabis across California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to echo that and also say
I think the Appalachians will be critical
[SPEAKER_03]: too for furthering the value of California
and Emerald Triangle and regional and
[SPEAKER_03]: specific cannabis as we do expand into a
national and global market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Senator McGuire has a bill that just came
out last week to further clarify the point
[SPEAKER_03]: of origin for the Appalachians of origin,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a program called the Mendocino
Appalachians Project, which is expanding
[SPEAKER_03]: its name, I think, to be the California
Appalachians Project.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would strongly recommend anyone to get
involved with that group, support that
[SPEAKER_03]: group.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a small, self-funded organization
that takes donations and contributions,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's critical for small farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, Mikey, I thought you might
want to say something as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually very bullish on Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's certainly the long game,
as Lauren says.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to be more and more
valuable when we have the national
[SPEAKER_07]: marketplace to play in.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, one of the slides on my deck
recently is if you look at the wine
[SPEAKER_07]: industry nationwide, 4% of the volume of
grapes come from Napa and Sonoma of the
[SPEAKER_07]: entire wine industry, yet Napa and Sonoma
wines command 54% of the revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: While they produce a very little amount of
volume, the revenue and the premium that
[SPEAKER_07]: they're getting is substantial.
[SPEAKER_07]: To Lauren's point, I love the Mendocino
Appalachians Project.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's incredible groups in the Emerald
Triangle, HCGA being one of them,
[SPEAKER_07]: MCGA, ICFA.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a couple of groups trying to
coalesce and find ways to collaborate,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we're trying to figure out how to
really put forward the Appalachians
[SPEAKER_07]: program, and also do it in a way that the
consumer can understand.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the onus is on you to make that be
something that the consumer understands.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when they walk in, they ask for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they see it, they recognize.
[SPEAKER_08]: So band together with others and yours.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they come in, they see a difference
between that and something maybe grown in
[SPEAKER_08]: a stinky warehouse in L.A.
[SPEAKER_08]: County.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's not forget, there are regions of
the state that are globally known for
[SPEAKER_06]: being some of the best sources for
cannabis in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd hate to cut it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great, great discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it once again for Lauren
Fraser, all the panelists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
