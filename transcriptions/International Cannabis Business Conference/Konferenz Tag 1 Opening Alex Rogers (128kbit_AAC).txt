[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, how y'all feeling this morning?
[SPEAKER_00]: You feeling good at the ICBC, everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Alex Rogers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the CEO and founder of the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came to Berlin in 2016, and I had a
vision of B2B cannabis in Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: something similar to what was going on in
America at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came over here, and everybody said I
was crazy, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: My German friend said, Alex, we are very
worried for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you say a frugal people?
[SPEAKER_00]: $500 a ticket is too much for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, we are very worried in your
very direct German-ness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, I'm very worried,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for that brutal
honesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it made me do is it made me work
even harder to make this vision and dream
[SPEAKER_00]: come true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I did was just put some blank
pages out, and you guys filled all those
[SPEAKER_00]: blank pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cannabis industry, the ICBC,
you guys, this is where it all gets done.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we catapult the industry at
a rapid rate to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the first thing I said when I got on
stage in 2017 at the first ICBC was that
[SPEAKER_00]: the policymakers and the administrators
would, pardon my French, even though we're
[SPEAKER_00]: in Germany, fuck things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's normal because I had already
been in jurisdictions where I had seen
[SPEAKER_00]: administrators, you know, it's politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand whether it's with tax or
regulations or cumbersome fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the idea is to take it off the
black market, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people will pay a little bit
more to know that they have a regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a point where, if it's too
much more, they'll choose to go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can't be lost on what's coming
with this market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be cognizant of that and understand
going forward, we really need to
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate on things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually do have a nascent market,
a thriving market, and a very prosperous
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did also say on stage was that in
2017, the first ICBC Berlin event,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Raise your hand if you were at the first
ICBC event.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raise your hand if this is your first ICBC
event ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of new faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I said was I said that
politicians, they're going to mess things
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm paraphrasing myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's going to happen is the most
important thing is that you have a home
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and you decriminalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make this flower not a crime anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Germany, this is exactly what they want
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know everybody has a different
opinion on what's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will tell you now, after all these
years, after all these years, this
[SPEAKER_00]: movement we have now in Germany is a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's incumbent upon us as stewards of
the industry to protect, nourish,
[SPEAKER_00]: and make this industry go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said before, be prosperous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please give yourself a big hand for
being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are nice people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are old school activists from the West
Coast that came here to bring this shiny
[SPEAKER_00]: vibe to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have one rule at the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's be nice to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we see behavior, be respectful to
women at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just love your brothers and sisters
and know we're all in this big boat
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be approachable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, be respectful at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only rule we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what happens when that happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only rule we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing.
Thank you.
