[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very special guest in the house
right now, six-time NBA World Champion,
[SPEAKER_00]: actor, vegan, and all-around awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of y'all want to see John Sally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make some noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: John, are you here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, he's here, right here, yo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make some noise for John Sally,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: How you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: This was very, did you learn anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did any of them leave any money up this
motherfucker?
[SPEAKER_02]: When Alex had me here like three years
ago, my daughter Tyler and I, we had just
[SPEAKER_02]: started our brand deuces.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not wearing it right now because I'm a
really bad marketer.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't get the new jersey.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we decided from this, spot when I was
here, I met Tommy Chong in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked weed with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lying.
[SPEAKER_02]: He smoked weed with me and it was my shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I decided just from this
conference to be serious about being in
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are gonna, you're gonna
hear these people sit up here and talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of them seem like, you know,
they're sitting there like stiff,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, I've been to all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been to some of them seriously that
didn't even have booze, but they was
[SPEAKER_02]: renting the booze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been to the low, low end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been to the ones that thought they
were high end.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were high at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear some of the best sales from Wall
Street guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wall Street ladies, Wall Street
transgender.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see them from every, I'm not leaving
anybody out, god damn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see them and I hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't know how long I've been in
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanna tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So since 2005, my boy got 20 years in jail
for making sure that the weed in New York
[SPEAKER_02]: smelled like California.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get that in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been literally trying to help
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before that, I was trying to get them
out of the business because I thought that
[SPEAKER_02]: they shouldn't be selling that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I didn't smoke weed at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't start smoking until 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Sacramento, 38, 24, 36.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, you'll get that joke,
it's on the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, do you smoke weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, nah, you know, I don't do that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was like, all right, I'ma be
leaving.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, let me try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me call my wife until I'm going to
sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told her I was going out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I smoked this weed and my left leg
became my right leg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do yoga and all of a sudden I was
doing things entirely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in one form.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, yo, this is the bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next day I get up with my teammates
and I was like, yo, I'm the last one on
[SPEAKER_02]: the bus, which is usually not happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get on the bus and I sit down and I
said, yo, what was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, that was the chronic,
Sal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you not to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, where'd I get the chronic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I have chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do I get that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I found this out a month before retiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if I would have found this out when I
was a bad boy, I might have hit more
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would still be playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Tom Brady smokes a lot of weed,
obviously, because there's no way to play
[SPEAKER_02]: this unbelievable shit and not smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't drink alcohol because,
and you can't just keep eating bad foods,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it destroys your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: It destroys your liver, your kidneys,
your relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make you smack your kids, kiss your
dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been in this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard just about everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys have no idea when I hear them speak
in gibberish or where I hear them speak in
[SPEAKER_02]: what I call NBC talk, pivoting and this
and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I hear that bullshit, I go,
I don't want you in the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just had a conversation with a guy
in the back who was asking how he can help
[SPEAKER_02]: regulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should go back to the mentality
when weed was never thought of of being
[SPEAKER_02]: dirty, never thought of of being bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never thought of having herbicides,
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only when we try to scale up to fulfill
everybody's dream of being wealthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's all you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you scale up to 80, 100,000 to make
this, you're fucking up the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it as small as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our brand, Deuces, and also in the
brand Lucky 420, which my friend Rachel is
[SPEAKER_02]: the CEO of, great pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked it at 10 and I woke up at nine
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, on the real, keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make Louie the 13th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not make Ripple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not make MD 4040.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop destroying the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you out there who don't like what I'm
saying, I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a friend in jail for making sure
that New York smelled like California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't even get caught with the
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we should have in here,
one of the things I want to get this
[SPEAKER_02]: legislation, everybody that's in jail,
God willing, for making sure New York
[SPEAKER_02]: smelled like California should be out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that realized it was a medicine
before, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Teach the newbies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my friend Zaire here from Detroit.
[SPEAKER_02]: She came all the way to San Francisco to
find out how to get in this business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine that?
[SPEAKER_02]: She came all the way and she went to
Oshadam, Oxxadam, yeah, I went too and I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't pronounce the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first thing I did in like,
I think it was 2008.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could teach this business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can have this business together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can keep, corporate's gonna come in and
buy the whole shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they buy me first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just being serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they buy me first.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want them to buy a product that
doesn't turn out to be like the products I
[SPEAKER_02]: took when I was playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to take these pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say their name because I don't
want to give them advertisement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I took Advil, six a day,
so my knees wouldn't hurt, my elbows
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't hurt, my neck wouldn't hurt,
my back wouldn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, it was so my kidneys wouldn't
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what wound up happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: This business, this plant is healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys saw Avatar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't destroy the fucking tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some blue guys and girls coming on
some shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I did Ayahuasca a little while
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously you can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I used to be, I had a filter because
I've been on television so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would know to take it to the edge and
then fade back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you went a little bit too over the
edge, I would say sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody would write an apology.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did Ayahuasca at this very,
very wealthy guy in Beverly Hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was so wealthy, he bought a shaman from
the middle of the Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: He landed a helicopter, grabbed the
shaman, bought his ass back to Beverly
[SPEAKER_02]: Hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how we like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, I was in Ayahuasca and
I'm watching all the shit happen in my
[SPEAKER_02]: brain and the colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I start laughing at shit that
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happened in 1979.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized this is healing my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Ayahuasca made me see things
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me open up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me, you know, I was introverted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have never gotten up on this
stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lying again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Introverted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have never gotten up and spoke so
much truth and fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not gonna, like when he said,
I'm not gonna get up and tell you what you
[SPEAKER_02]: should do, how we should do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I'm asking you to do is
keep the plant a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it Louis the 13th.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wanna do some liquor, I met
somebody yesterday who was talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: infusing the beer with the, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep the alcohol over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep the plant over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beer is down 30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wine is down 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not because people don't drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because people now realize this is
how you should enhance your brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how you should literally feed
everything that's inside your body by
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking it, by vaping it, by eating it,
by sharing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like I jumped around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: John Sally, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it for John Sally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 22.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fight the power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deuces22.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deuces22.com.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
