[SPEAKER_03]: Here to discuss continental and
international cannabis policy,
[SPEAKER_03]: we are pleased and honored to have the
national drug coordinator from the Czech
[SPEAKER_03]: Republic, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's hear it for Jindrik Vova≈ôil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did my best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you allow me to have a morning exercise
to raise the hand, who in this room thinks
[SPEAKER_02]: that prohibition actually should remain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did prohibition serve any good purpose?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's quite important to speak
about the fact where we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been around for 35 years as a
practitioner, working with people in
[SPEAKER_02]: addiction and prevention, and 15 years in
policy making.
[SPEAKER_02]: Directly accountable to the prime
minister, some with six prime ministers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Giving reports and monitoring reports of
all drugs, but alcohol, tobacco,
[SPEAKER_02]: gambling as well in my country,
and digital addictions at this moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at data, I have a monitoring
center under my office as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been looking at the data over and
over and over and over, and it took me
[SPEAKER_02]: several years to understand what is the
situation with prohibition?
[SPEAKER_02]: What actually prohibition did to the whole
situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's quite important to analyze
what is actually possible and what is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the you curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if you've seen this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in several reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's written by the EMCDDA Monitoring
Center.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have heard about this monitoring
center.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's agency run by European Commission,
and it's based in Lisbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually it says that when we look at
any regulations, we have two extremes.
[SPEAKER_02]: One extreme is unregulated market,
absolutely unlimited access, and we used
[SPEAKER_02]: to have this with alcohol even,
sell underage, with tobacco as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in a time where as a child I was
able to go to a shop and buy cigarettes
[SPEAKER_02]: and buy alcohol, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not allowed in restaurants,
but it was allowed in shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today it's not possible, I mean,
not possible in inverted commas,
[SPEAKER_02]: because sometimes it's very easy for
teenagers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the other hand, it's the
prohibition, prohibition in terms,
[SPEAKER_02]: as we know it, in illicit drugs and we
experience in other parts in the world
[SPEAKER_02]: with alcohol, which is under criminal
sanctions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can have prohibited items or goods or
food, for example, which is not prohibited
[SPEAKER_02]: under the criminal sanctions, but with
cannabis and other drugs, we have it under
[SPEAKER_02]: criminal sanctions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Czech Republic, as many of you might know,
is one of the countries with the most
[SPEAKER_02]: liberal laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: We decriminalized position for personal
use a few decades ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other hand, we still have 14%
of people in prison for drugs offenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean that 14% of the people who
are in prison represents the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: criminal activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drug criminal activities is only 3%,
but 14% of the people in prison is because
[SPEAKER_02]: these people serve longer sentences than
many other prisoners, longer sentences
[SPEAKER_02]: than sexual assault, child abuse,
domestic violence.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the fact of current state of play
still today.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than half of these people are for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's across the EU and it's across the
world because, it's very simple,
[SPEAKER_02]: when people are caught with 20,
30, 40 plants, it's kilos.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, in Czech Republic,
we produce methamphetamine.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are caught with methamphetamine
with few grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get two years in prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have 20 kilos, you are in higher
paragraphs and you get five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in fact, in Czech Republic,
for a longer time, already we have medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis since 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe we were globally the first
country allowing medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: according to the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you know that Holland and few
other countries did it before us,
[SPEAKER_02]: but first legislation was approved by the
INCB inspection, which is the inspection
[SPEAKER_02]: for UN bodies, UNODC.
[SPEAKER_02]: UNODC in 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2021, we allowed 1% of THC in so-called
technical cannabis or hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, we passed a bill through the
parliament and it was notified by European
[SPEAKER_02]: Union, which we call psychomodulatory
substances, which is empty list,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: We created a new category.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have products which are for human
consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have food, you have medicines,
and then now we have third category in the
[SPEAKER_02]: EU, which is psychomodulatory substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under this bill, this is an empty list and
the government will put substances on this
[SPEAKER_02]: list after some evaluation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually two lists.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is the evaluating list for maximum two
years, and then there is a permanent list,
[SPEAKER_02]: which will allow probably first instance
will be Krathome, and we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: the products with THC up to one or maybe
2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also talking about AHC, for example,
and other products of similar sort.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ban AHC recently, only until the end of
this year, waiting for this bill to come,
[SPEAKER_02]: and after we say, okay, we will probably
regulate with specialized shops and very
[SPEAKER_02]: strict regulations, stricter than alcohol,
stricter than tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are waiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drafted a new bill for regulating
non-medical use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than 1%, we're talking about 20% of
THC, and that should be introduced to the
[SPEAKER_02]: parliament this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll explain what's the troubles
around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before I'll get into the legal battle
I want to also say we have to be aware
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's not only legal battles that we
fight in, and it's not only ideology that
[SPEAKER_02]: we fight in, we also fight in,
or battling, I don't know how to put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are standing in the whole process
against other industries, legal and
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, most obvious one, alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I remember a couple of years ago,
my colleague sat with alcohol industries,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you have, of course, beer,
you have wine, and you have the spirits.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're usually divided.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fight against each other,
but when it comes to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're very united, and one of the
leaders of the spirit industry said,
[SPEAKER_02]: we will make everything and we'll put all
the possible money to stop your cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation, without shame, directly to us
in a public debate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we have illegal industry,
which is extremely rich, and I have a,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe some of you already heard me
speaking about it, I have this
[SPEAKER_02]: declassified EU, I mean EU CIA report,
which speaks about people like Viktor
[SPEAKER_02]: Ivanov.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you heard about Viktor
Ivanov.
[SPEAKER_02]: Viktor Ivanov was my counterpart in
Russian Federation, the National Drug
[SPEAKER_02]: Coordinator, which clearly speaks about,
this report clearly speaks how,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he was the chief of staff at some
point in Putin's office, and this reports
[SPEAKER_02]: clearly speaks how, since 80s,
when he became the boss of the department,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then Putin was the boss of the KGB,
how they started, to the disgrace of many
[SPEAKER_02]: people, to dislike of many people in the
KGB, so I don't want to blame KGB as such,
[SPEAKER_02]: but to the dislike of many people in KGB,
these people started organizing the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: shipping through St. Petersburg,
cocaine, heroin from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have time to speak about it,
I spent a long time in Afghanistan myself,
[SPEAKER_02]: and in Colombia, Bolivia, so that would be
long stories to speak about this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody is interested, I have the
report here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we standing against legal industry,
very powerful legal industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you will hear some of the
industries from Big Pharma as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: not being very happy about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have alcohol industry, and then we have
illegal industries, which are as powerful
[SPEAKER_02]: as the legal ones, using also legal
instruments against it, like campaign,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not easy, and then, of course,
we have, sorry, I'll skip this,
[SPEAKER_02]: then we have the international laws,
and then we have European laws,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is even more complicated for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stand here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I won't go to all the... So this is a
council conclusion, the framework made by
[SPEAKER_02]: the European Union, which actually says
that apart from personal possession for
[SPEAKER_02]: personal use, it's not allowed,
and it even sets a number of years,
[SPEAKER_02]: or it sets the legal standards,
how countries in the EU should criminalize
[SPEAKER_02]: possession of what drugs, of course,
sale and production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So apart from personal possession,
all the other activities, according to EU
[SPEAKER_02]: law, is not allowed, and it's supposed to
be criminalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where we are at this moment,
but we have some hopes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Czech views, we said that we should
look at it differently, and that's what we
[SPEAKER_02]: push in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not the only one in the EU,
as you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our first highlighted idea,
idea, I would say, it's not only idea,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all the data, we have all the best
practice, how to regulate substances that
[SPEAKER_02]: pose any risks in terms of psychotropic
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we said the first thing should be
regulating substances according to their
[SPEAKER_02]: risks, whether they are legal or illegal
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look at risks, levels of alcohol,
and comparing it with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I don't have to go into details
about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we need to look at prevention
of the effects of illegal market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know in alcohol, we know in tobacco,
that illegal market would be the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we think that with cannabis it's
different?
[SPEAKER_02]: That prohibition could help in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course illegal market has a lot of
enormous problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is the next sentence,
that money flow from illicit market are
[SPEAKER_02]: actually more risky in terms of security
than drugs itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know where the money goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that it supports not only criminal
activities, it supports totalitarian
[SPEAKER_02]: states, and it supports terrorism.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: So money flowing from illicit market are
actually more risky to the security,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is always the main argument,
security, security.
[SPEAKER_02]: The security is actually compromised by
money flowing from illicit market to any
[SPEAKER_02]: other kind of enormous global organized
crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we know that cannabis is also a
substitute to more risky alternatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Positive effects of economy and public
safety, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to talk about this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we say that actually regulated market,
we have all the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulated market is better tool than in
prevention is better tool than
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it with other substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we already seen the data now with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course we should mention the human
rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: The commission, the highest commissioner
for human rights last year, you might have
[SPEAKER_02]: come across with that, said released a
report and said that the interpretation of
[SPEAKER_02]: 1961 convention pushing the countries to
send people to long sentences,
[SPEAKER_02]: life imprisonment, and executions in many
countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hundreds of thousand people have already
been executed since we started a
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since that time, the cannabis market,
illicit market is only growing across the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says clearly this is again the
charter of human rights of the UN,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we are all based on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this is so important to speak
about decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that you're talking about science.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about use of cannabis for
medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's quite important to speak
about the whole thing in terms of decrim
[SPEAKER_02]: because decriminalization is one of the
main tools to actually be able to operate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not going to because I don't have
so much time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to have some questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what actually at this moment we are
allowed according to the European laws,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I forget the international law,
because international law is only blame
[SPEAKER_02]: and shame, but according to European law,
which has some tools to actually put
[SPEAKER_02]: sanctions on countries if they are in
breach with the European law.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are allowed to do home growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are allowed maybe cannabis clubs,
it's on the edge, or any kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: as we call it, delegation of home growing
to other person.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are allowed of course to do medical
use, production and sale for medical use
[SPEAKER_02]: strictly in medical setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually according to a current European
law, it's not possible to have regulated
[SPEAKER_02]: market, which would be the most beneficial
regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to bore you with all this
legal situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to ask me the questions,
I think that's complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know that today the differences are
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean in US you have commercial market in
different states,
[SPEAKER_02]: not federal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada, there is a federal and Uruguay you
have market, but it's not allowed in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: In European Union, so in European Union
you have what you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most currently Germany and Malta
introduced the laws for possibility of
[SPEAKER_02]: accessing cannabis for non-medical use,
but again the same situation that we are
[SPEAKER_02]: facing in Czech Republic trying to push
the law for market, that the European
[SPEAKER_02]: Commission will meet with you informally
and say informally, don't use it formally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did all these meetings, but we are
telling you if you open the market,
[SPEAKER_02]: you will be in breach of the EU law and we
will have to act.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that same happened to Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have followed the battle they
had.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to open a regulated market at
the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have it in some cities as a study.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is how we have to work in the
current state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to finish and with a
sentence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that here we are not in an activist
meeting and I'm not an activist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a policy maker and it took me,
I will tell you, seven years to come to
[SPEAKER_02]: this conclusion since 2010 when I started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started in my office and I was looking
at the data over and over and over and
[SPEAKER_02]: over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remembering some situations such as 1998,
the declaration of all heads of state of
[SPEAKER_02]: UN claiming the world will be free of
drugs 2008 and we can see that the drugs
[SPEAKER_02]: market quadrupled since 1961.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prohibition is a cruel and failing social
experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to find other options.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to start something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will have a ministerial conference in
Berlin in November, so in a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: months and one of the outcomes we hope
will be that we will decide and agree with
[SPEAKER_02]: a number of countries to start the process
of changing this council decision of
[SPEAKER_02]: European Union, so changing the European
law in terms of opening the possibility
[SPEAKER_02]: for states or for countries, for member
states to regulate according to their
[SPEAKER_02]: level of knowledge of the risks of
different substances and especially with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will happen and I'm sure we only
don't know when and how and who,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have time for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone have a, man your hand shot
right up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here I come, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon me if you'll excuse me,
beg your pardon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon me, excuse me, beg your pardon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, so my question is what is your
opinion, which country have the best
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation regarding safety, regarding the
less of use of heavy drugs, less
[SPEAKER_00]: criminality in this meaning and what think
you also about now the Germany system is,
[SPEAKER_00]: for your opinion, good?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very complex question of course,
thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think cannabis regulation so far seems
to be in, from my eyes and from our views
[SPEAKER_02]: when we look at preventative measures
because my role is prevention of
[SPEAKER_02]: addictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Canada, it seems, because if we look at
the data in terms of for example underage,
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at the cohort of 15 to 19 year
old, it's dropping down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know this from Holland for example for
decades that the cannabis coffee shops
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't raise the problem for underage.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of all, media would call it hard
drugs, we don't call it in our field hard
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs and soft drugs, it's complicated to
distinguish because it's alcohol hard
[SPEAKER_02]: drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, depends on what the society wants
because as I said, I'm looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: addiction problem as one issue,
alcohol, gambling, tobacco, all drugs that
[SPEAKER_02]: we have currently under prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also look at digital addictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any strict regulations, we have all the
data and any strict regulations,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, we know regulations with
alcohol in North America or Scandinavia,
[SPEAKER_02]: it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same works with other drugs,
it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So strict regulations such as specialized
shops, such as specialized license for the
[SPEAKER_02]: people who sell those substances which can
be taken away when these people break the
[SPEAKER_02]: rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, sell underage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not everywhere, it's in limited
places and there is strong prevention,
[SPEAKER_02]: not advertising allowed, high price
because of excise tax, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these kind of bunch of rules,
but it has to be hand to hand with
[SPEAKER_02]: prevention and help.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if this together is put together,
then it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of number of problem drug users,
when we look for example in injecting drug
[SPEAKER_02]: use, European Union comparing to the rest
of the world is better in many ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with lower number of injecting drug
users comparing to Eastern Europe,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, Ukraine, Russia or other
places, US, I think it's because we
[SPEAKER_02]: decriminalize at some point so people were
able to access services.
[SPEAKER_02]: We early on introduced so-called harm
reduction approach which doesn't push
[SPEAKER_02]: people only for abstinence but what allow
people, for example, substitution programs
[SPEAKER_02]: and as we know, substitution, whether it's
substituted in market or with doctor from
[SPEAKER_02]: medical hands is one of the best tools,
substitution to the drugs which are on the
[SPEAKER_02]: illicit market, substituting with less
risky drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That actually works.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, we're looking at the tobacco
epidemics now.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we see very quick, very fast drop off
of lung cancers, heart diseases,
[SPEAKER_02]: premature death because people switched
from smoking because the smoking,
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever smokes cannabis, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an abstinent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even drink alcohol, but whoever
smokes cannabis, so I would recommend to
[SPEAKER_02]: switch from smoking to any other type of
use because the tar that we use from
[SPEAKER_02]: anything burned, especially the paper,
that is what is killing us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see the substitution in market is
very, very useful tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these two things has to work,
prevention and help and very strict
[SPEAKER_02]: substituted market with less risky drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, it's very difficult to give
answer to this complex question and you
[SPEAKER_02]: ask another question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The German model, of course, the Germany
knows that the model is not the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: The initial draft was much more complex,
much more kind of worked through,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they crushed against the wall with the
European law.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we have this meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a meeting in Berlin on the
ministerial level in the 17th of November,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to cut you off, but we have time
for one more quick question right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: When will the psycho-modulatory substances
act will go into force and can you already
[SPEAKER_01]: apply for licenses?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're asking about the time when it
starts, yes?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We aim in at 1st January of next year,
so a few months from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The license system is going to be
regulated by bylaw.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have the paper already of the bylaw
written, but it's not official yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we aim in at starting with the whole
process from 1st of January, but we need
[SPEAKER_02]: to first discuss which substances are
going to be put first in the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably going to be Kratom.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC with higher, I mean the products with
THC round of 1%, above 3%, above 0.3% to
[SPEAKER_02]: 1%, maybe 2, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll see what's going to happen with
substances such as THC, it's a government
[SPEAKER_02]: decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might actually be practically in
action I would say the end of February,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe March, maybe April as well,
yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are pushing to start as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean the law will be there, so we want
this to be active and we want to pull all
[SPEAKER_02]: the substances from the gray zone,
because for example Kratom is sold as,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm finishing already, the Kratom is sold
as a decorative subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want it January government decision
and February to be a camaraderie
[SPEAKER_02]: substance, not decorative subject.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to hearing the results of
the ministerial meeting in November.
[SPEAKER_03]: The country is going to team up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just going to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the International Cannabis
Business Conference in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the science and technology forum
brought to you by title sponsor Laurel
[SPEAKER_03]: Crest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd also like to shout out Metaflora for
sponsoring the party tonight at the Grand
[SPEAKER_03]: Topolice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Close enough?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Topolice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
