[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, Anthony Johnson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no system is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your ups and downs, your
obstacles, but the future is bright and
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany's pharmacy system is in many ways
leading the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to keep the discussion
going and talk more about German
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a consultant with Hapa Medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please give a warm welcome for Mr. Tobias
Loder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was asked if I could make a presentation
today about the path of medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in German pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it actually work in Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought about making a presentation in
Berlin in front of hundreds of people on
[SPEAKER_01]: the subject of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you not want that?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, the topic is very dear to my
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very important to me to be able to
say something about German pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's too short for all discussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every gram that is sold in Germany is sold
through a German pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third, Henry Rowlands and Cypress Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't say no anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the individual parties that have
to do with medical cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to talk about each individual
party from the point of view of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have almost every day to do with all
parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, it all comes together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to explain why the pharmacy
is at the center, why it is an important
[SPEAKER_01]: building block in the course of the whole
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not talk about the health insurance
companies, because health insurance
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are too complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are currently 110 health insurance
companies in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of them plays its own game.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are roof associations and there are
joint executions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevertheless, everyone decides for
himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the medical service of the health
insurance companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very complex topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start with the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been self-medication with
cannabis for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis was a normal medication up to a
hundred years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: People's medicine for all kinds of
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was used everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means there is the knowledge about
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also people who know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They turn it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until illegal, now legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patients we have, the ones we take
care of, can also compare the effects of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis to the normal medications that
they receive from their doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They notice what is good for them and what
is not good for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really important and very huge how
big the experience of the patients are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote something about dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote that it is extremely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are patients who get 0.2 grams a
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others need more than 3 grams a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They drive a car, they can move,
they can work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is good for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one patient who has chronic disc
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_01]: He couldn't take part in life anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can do it with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that patients prefer natural
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about Doronavinol, Sativex.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just a second choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the choice, take medical
cannabis, because it works best,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it can be dosaged best.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sell, or give up, mainly Bedrocan with
the strength of 22% THC and 1% CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is also the only thing that is
always available.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patients and the doctors agree on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means there are so many more
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have patients who vary with THC and
CBD, but the availability is very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you can't take part in life under
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has all strong side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is good if you have an alternative
and the patients realize that they get
[SPEAKER_01]: through life much better with
significantly less strong side effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they can use medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we found totally interesting and
exciting, that was also quite new,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they use different varieties
depending on the form of the day and the
[SPEAKER_01]: time of the day, when it comes to THC and
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the morning maybe a little more THC,
in the evening more CBD, or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is completely individual,
depends on the disease, also depends on
[SPEAKER_01]: the severity of the disease, how it is
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: For application, it is mostly smoked or
inhaled.
[SPEAKER_01]: That works the fastest, that is well
controllable, it doesn't last that long,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it works when you need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't recommend smoking a joint,
that is clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vaporizer would be much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also varieties that pay the
hospital bills, but it rarely happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be more, I think it is better,
or we think it is better as a pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is not that great yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is completely missing at the moment
is an oral intake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the one hand there are patients who
want to have a quick effect, a quick side
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other patients who want a very
even and long effect, and that is not
[SPEAKER_01]: really achievable with smoking and
inhalation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lack oil or extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the different THC and CBD
concentrations, for the patients who want
[SPEAKER_01]: a long and even effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we welcome that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say we, sometimes pharmacy,
or pharmacy, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big problem for the patient is to find a
doctor who has an open ear for the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most go to their home doctor first.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are lucky, this home doctor has an
open ear for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is not always the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they might have illegal experience with
cannabis and know that it helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they have to look for a new
doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even without cannabis, to find a doctor in
Germany nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many have an intake stop, they no longer
accept patients, they are overloaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you come to the topic of
cannabis, to a new doctor, as a new
[SPEAKER_01]: patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctor is first of all skeptical,
a new patient, wants to have a BTM,
[SPEAKER_01]: on request, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if he has a doctor who gives him
something, then he needs a pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is not at all said that the
pharmacy finds that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, any pharmacy can order cannabis
and give it away, but I know my
[SPEAKER_01]: colleagues, they don't really like to do
that either.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are reservations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at the wishes of the patients,
delivery capacity, I'll say something
[SPEAKER_01]: about that in a moment, then it is
especially the end-to-end bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it starts that he has to make an
application with the doctor at the
[SPEAKER_01]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctor has to be well-founded.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have already heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has to be out-therapized, that means he
has to have significantly stronger drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: already received, which have not been
approved, in order to be able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the application has to be checked by
the hospital, then it has to be approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctor has to perform a follow-up
examination for the hospitals anonymously,
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to document how cannabis is used.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it works, whether it works or not,
there are zero official experiences,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the doctor is only allowed to write
down the requirement for 28 days on one
[SPEAKER_01]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not possible anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: He could write down more, then he has to
make an A with a circle around it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but only a few doctors do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means every four weeks the patient is
in the pharmacy again and has to go to his
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he is in the pharmacy and wants to
get his dose or his doses, we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: check that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are prescription substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are closed, they have a certain
durability.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we open the can, then the durability
is only very limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means we can check the doses,
the material only when the patient is also
[SPEAKER_01]: in the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes half an hour, easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bill, and, and, and, and,
and.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means all bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is made quite difficult for the
patient to simply get his medicine from
[SPEAKER_01]: the doctor to the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I find quite interesting,
we always discuss, is the better care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was asked, how can patients,
especially patients, how can we represent
[SPEAKER_01]: that the care situation is simply better
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually focus on two points.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the one hand, we need to specialize in
cannabinoids, specialized doctors who are
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with the whole spectrum,
who know what they are used for,
[SPEAKER_01]: in what concentrations and conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, the doctor is mostly only on
request.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not an active regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctor does not know himself either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yellow is in balloon centers,
doctors who do this actively, it certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: does well for the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what it looks like with
the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need pharmacies, focus pharmacies,
which have all sorts, who are familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with it, who know the differences,
who can advise the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I turn this on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I take it in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I make myself a tea?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I bake a cookie?
[SPEAKER_01]: The white pharmacy is not normal at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work very hard on the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is also very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from the patient's point of view,
it is all a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all know the topic more than all
pharmacists and pharmacies together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if there are single pharmacists
and pharmacies that deal with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is good for the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thus also for the whole cannabis,
medicinal cannabis business in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this patient is really demanding from
the point of view of a pharmacy or from
[SPEAKER_01]: the point of view of the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He demands something, does a lot of work
for the doctor, does a lot of work for the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the patient has firm wishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes to the doctor and says,
please give me the medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the doctor actually doesn't like that
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there comes one, the doctor likes that
anyway, if someone is informed beforehand
[SPEAKER_01]: on the Internet and comes and says,
I have this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I need this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctor doesn't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can partly understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in this case, with medicinal
cannabis, it was allowed by law.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a drug that was developed over
10, 15 years, where there are studies on
[SPEAKER_01]: effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it is discussed in medical
newspapers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you also say what it is for,
what it is against.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone knows at some point and
everyone is looking forward to being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to order the new drug, because it is
better than any other before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, a drug was suddenly allowed by law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite a strange situation, also overwhelms
all parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means the doctor is skeptical,
does not write BTM on request.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means the doctor asks everything
very, very clearly, especially with first
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just told you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mentioned beforehand, that is also
completely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany is totally in love with chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know the highest AG, Merck,
Bayer, BASF.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is tradition, that is history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany is a place of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And natural plants have never had a high
place value here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evidence-based medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that is not checked, how many people
it affects, then it is not worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctor refuses or has a bad feeling to
order something, if he does not have a
[SPEAKER_01]: clear study situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is basically historical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also came to the language beforehand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctor is afraid of regression.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the one hand, on the other hand,
it is a paradox, because the hospital has
[SPEAKER_01]: approved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctor has made a very, very detailed
approach to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only two thirds of them are approved,
but if they are approved, they cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: actually be retaxed again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the topic is not quite finished yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very elaborate formalities for
the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very elaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes much longer than the exhibition
of a normal recipe, especially with first
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The doctor gets money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is for the regulation of cannabis,
also for the support, also for the
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is a few euros.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not think it is 15 euros that he gets
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he does not have a relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have to deal with some doctors,
and they are very, very reserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no own initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no doctor who says, oh,
that's exciting, I'll try it out with the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are doctors who waver a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are interested and they are also
looking for a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: They often call us and ask, how do I set
up a recipe, how does it work,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do I have to pay attention to,
what is the dosage, what is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can already see the differences with
the doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are for it or against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people who reject it,
the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the others who open up to it,
they are also interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have written to the experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the ones who are currently in
charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very important to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people are not aware that everything
is going on in the pharmacy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pharmacy solves all problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are right between the hospital,
the patient, the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually solve everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the date correct, not on the recipe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the strength not on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the dosage not indicated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a name missing?
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, it is a normal BTM medicine from
the formality.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is checked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, if something is not right,
we have to look for a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to communicate with every party,
in the sense of the patient, until we can
[SPEAKER_01]: give him his medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a lot of work, because it is also
untrained between the parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is also very important is the
transition from controlled surveillance,
[SPEAKER_01]: namely to the pharmacy, always with the
bodyguard, always with the police,
[SPEAKER_01]: always with gram-precise documentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: When does it go from A to B, is it handed
over, is it taken over, everything with
[SPEAKER_01]: signature.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the pharmacy leaves, then it is out of
the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pharmacy is the transition from a
closed system to public.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an interface.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are extremely under surveillance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The authorities have a good eye on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a duty to advise.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to advise the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our job.
[SPEAKER_01]: By law, we can't really do it with medical
cannabis, because there is hardly any
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pharmacies, newspapers, this is
getting better and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God, they have accepted the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is really new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, from the point of view of the
pharmacy, I have already said it before,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, at the beginning, we have every
single dose, 5 gram doses that are closed,
[SPEAKER_01]: very carefully tested with a thin layer of
chromatography on quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who has ever done a thin layer of
chromatography, it takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at how it goes up so slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as the patient actually has to
wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have done this for every single dose,
until we thought it couldn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we take a THC drug test stick and
make one dose per charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is obviously okay and saves a lot of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are pharmacy pharmacies,
German pharmacies are under the
[SPEAKER_01]: supervision of pharmacy pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can come in unannounced at any time,
on any topic, it doesn't matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: gladly to BTM, because that has to be
documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it has to match the tablets exactly,
gram exactly, milliliters exactly,
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like to fall on it first.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a pharmacy wants to have something for
the patient, then they actually have to
[SPEAKER_01]: take money into their hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need, you need a tracer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every pharmacy has a tracer, but it is as
big as a small refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_01]: That quickly becomes too small if you have
5 or 10 patients who each need 50 grams,
[SPEAKER_01]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 doses per month.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to pre-sales, a kilogram costs
10,000 euros per purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of money either, you get
something for it, but first you go to
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the product often has short run
times, i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't really like to store,
because the delivery capacity has a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the short run times,
but it threatens to fall, you can't give
[SPEAKER_01]: it up anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: The finished product has to be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone always laughs, yes, then you
destroy the medical cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacy, it's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't distribute it under the shelf,
that doesn't work, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just rinse it in the toilet,
it shouldn't affect the groundwater,
[SPEAKER_01]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to burn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to convince, burn it so that
nothing remains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't had that yet, because we always
got everything loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are pharmacies, if something
remains, it has to go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, that's how we really heard it,
O-tones from colleagues in pharmacies,
[SPEAKER_01]: they call us, we have a patient who has a
recipe for medical cannabis, do you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to have the patient, should we send him
over?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, that's already 800 euros in sales
for a month, we have nothing against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it says, yes, we don't want junkies
there, okay, let's leave it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmacies have experience with methadone,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: heroin substitution, these are of course
junkies, that is also a different human
[SPEAKER_01]: image than a cannabis patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is often thrown into a pot by
pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty sad and needs a little
clarification, but that's how it is here
[SPEAKER_01]: and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the pharmacy, it smells like grass
with us, not with the doctor, not with the
[SPEAKER_01]: hospital, the pharmacy smells,
you have to explain that to the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: staff first, or to the other customers in
front in the sales room, if someone picks
[SPEAKER_01]: up his 100 grams of grass, it smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to implement that first,
that's actually quite funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the vessels don't stop the smell,
the trousseau doesn't either, the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacy smells afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of this for a normal pharmacy,
they are really overwhelmed and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: rather reject it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a patient still has a question,
how do I do this now, what indications and
[SPEAKER_01]: what relationship, they all stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no routine comes in, no routine comes
in from a normal pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let the two, three, four patients have a
month, that's not always the same employee
[SPEAKER_01]: or not always the pharmacist himself,
that won't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm back on the subject of the
focus pharmacy, that certainly makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, now I'm coming to our pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone had told me 20 years ago in the
studio that I would hold a lecture on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and show a trousseau with two
kilograms of grass in it, then I would
[SPEAKER_01]: probably have asked, but what did it smell
like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it is today, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our new trousseau now,
it's so high, that's about two kilograms
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So almost 20,000 euros, which are just
lying there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of money, but the patient wants to
have delivery capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't have that, then it won't come
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now made a homepage,
cannabisapotheke.de, it's not quite
[SPEAKER_01]: finished yet, but we, it is important to
us that the patients, they call,
[SPEAKER_01]: they drive 100 kilometers sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to show them what we have there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's borderline with BTM.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't pre-order or something,
but we can say, red or green, the product
[SPEAKER_01]: is at the warehouse, that's not at the
warehouse, please call, we'll put it back,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll reserve it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking a big step towards the
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 400 cans in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we always take what we can get,
and that's also the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in front of the gates of Cologne,
Cologne is a great city.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope a lot more will happen there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to position ourselves as the
pharmacy.
Positioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have patients, I just said,
some of them came from Paris, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't get it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they drive more than 100 kilometers,
we also drive ourselves, we have our own
[SPEAKER_01]: vehicles, they drive around different
things, parental nutrition, of course you
[SPEAKER_01]: can also take medical cannabis with you on
these roads.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on the road, you can send it with
DHL.
[SPEAKER_01]: The B-Farm says, you can get away from the
delivery, but it's still allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not forbidden, so let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are all things that normal
pharmacies struggle with.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a result, these are very, very loyal
customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really appreciate that we work hard
for them, that we go after them,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we do what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's often not good for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what a lot of pharmacies learn,
that patients don't do it for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis patients, it's not always good
for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, when it's clicked in the
pharmacy, they like to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The employees are also fully behind it,
because they realize that they are problem
[SPEAKER_01]: customers and we can do something good for
them and our job as a pharmacy will be
[SPEAKER_01]: very fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you actually have more feedback than
with a high blood pressure patient,
[SPEAKER_01]: who doesn't care about it and goes on as
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a closer relationship to the
cannabis patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to briefly enter into the
company Zeutschen Großhandel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked a little bit with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our impression is that they don't have
much interest in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big volume, which they have to
turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of patches, a lot of
capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's these cans for 5 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they really wanted to keep it for a
location, for the Cologne room,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything at the warehouse, they would
actually have to expand their BTM room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The margin is low.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have 3% on the purchasing price,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: on the sales price plus 70 cents.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same margin as with a normal
prescription drug plus all the
[SPEAKER_01]: formalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is here, I met him earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They recognize that something is happening
and they have an eye on it, but they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: care about it
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then of course we also have to do with the
owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't that many.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all start-ups, you really have
to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've met some start-ups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they are start-ups in the area of
cannabis and pharmacies, with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: corresponding advantages and
disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very engaged, innovative, growth-oriented,
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Idealism, venture capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very interesting mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy it, I feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a hectic start.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really know about it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The delivery dates are not strictly
followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The invoices are put in a strange way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no return regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that, which is actually quite
normal for a pharmacy, they have to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they learn, or hopefully they have
learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should orient themselves to
established examples of how it works,
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to be accepted by the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't get any trust from the
pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmacists are usually very stingy
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They find ions in the reagent glass,
also the needle in the haystack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if something is not right,
then the pharmacists are strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's bad for the business,
also for the manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they should look so calmly that they do
it the same way as the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's no problem, as long as the
demand is much higher than the supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is taken out of their hands,
so they forgive everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that can change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the pharmaceutical establishment,
which has been mentioned several times
[SPEAKER_01]: today, shares 100% of the opinion,
they all look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone decides to actively intervene,
then it gets tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the startups, the manufacturers,
are not experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are basically rules of the game in
the German pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you either have to stick to them,
or at least you should know them,
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to know what you're not doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone is here to do business in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super pharmacy, huge chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read before that it could become the
second largest cannabis market in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicinal cannabis, surely everything is
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't underestimate that it is
also the second largest pharmacy in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, and not without reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are locked in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a team, the German pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't even let any Canadians on
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think they should try their luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I want to say something about
the German pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because no one has spoken about it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are around 1,500 pharmaceutical
companies in Germany, alone in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to read everything now,
you can read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to be aware that there are
numerous fairs and events, every year,
[SPEAKER_01]: numerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: People meet there, they know each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because so many of them are not the
actors.
[SPEAKER_01]: No leadership, who once was a sales
manager at a manufacturer, will remain a
[SPEAKER_01]: sales manager forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next time, he will become a businessman at
the next firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means they are wandering in the
course of their careers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means, at some point,
everyone knows each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone knows each other over two
corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes very fast, how they spread
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a consultant myself many years ago,
among other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: For Dutch, Koreans, Swedes and Swiss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's always funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they see Germany, a totally crumpled
market, all the rules, it's all nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that in a completely different
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think they know it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all bite their teeth, one after the
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They underestimate how it works here,
how the rules are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when you come from liberal
markets and see Germany with chambers and
[SPEAKER_01]: associations, it's like the Middle Ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are things that are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote down a few key points.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drug advertising law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The right to work for the doctor,
the right to work for the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means, it's not legally defined or
forbidden, but it's a right to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: A doctor is not allowed to consult the
internet during a video call.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is not allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is prohibited from working.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can lose his probation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's total nonsense, but it is so.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other countries, it's probably
completely normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a ban on accession.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doctors and pharmacies are not allowed to
work together at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the right to compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the pharmacy law, the pharmacy
business order, the drug price regulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: the legal health insurance, the regression
requirements to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means, there are so many things to
consider when you want to run a successful
[SPEAKER_01]: business here and then come from the
fishing system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is underestimated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is greatly underestimated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone should deal with it well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The German system is set up in such a way
that it is a defense system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no attackers, but they can
really defend bombs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very difficult to get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a conclusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can talk to neighbors, friends,
employees, patients, really relaxed about
[SPEAKER_01]: the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has become completely normal now,
but two years ago it was completely
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really out of the mud, which is
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can discuss it, you can find it good
or bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, almost no one finds it bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: The daily newspapers report on the spot,
probably everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, mostly positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some seniors, who are doing better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the high resistance that
exists, which have already been mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: several times, they stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is systemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the purpose of the resistance,
that they are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you want to stay under yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course you don't want medical
cannabis, which grows somewhere here as a
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pharmaceutical industry wants to sell
their medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: A ruler who has an expensive MS medicine
for a few thousand euros, he doesn't think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's good that he smokes the same patient
for 50 grams of grass a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is much better for him and can then
reduce the other medicine by half.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means, in terms of handling,
de-bureaucratization, we should stay on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you can certainly do a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our lobby work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lobby work hand-in-hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole hemp business has to work on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Availability in the assortment,
that will certainly improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get that with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The licences are applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: The varieties are all there, if not in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they will come.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it will stay expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were talks between the top
associations of the health insurance
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and the pharmacy associations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pharmacies are even far too cheap,
because they have a lot of work with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nonsense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's work, but you get money for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it will stay like that for
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prices will not change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've written it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great that it's that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who would have thought that?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't be satisfied with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is still a lot to do for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
