[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, ICBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is awesome, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Second day, third day for some of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be discussing for the next
hour cannabis and emerging markets,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is actually a really, really
fascinating topic because at least we were
[SPEAKER_02]: discussing in the green room, there is
really no such thing as a cannabis market
[SPEAKER_02]: that really is not an emerging market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that we have some really
interesting panelists today who are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to give us a perspective of what it means
to be an emerging market, some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: issues that are going on, and how to work
successfully in your emerging market as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as inter-emerging market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think everybody's name is up here,
but we have really, really wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: people to discuss what's going on in the
UK and Ireland, in Greece, in Zimbabwe,
[SPEAKER_02]: and New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, of course, we'd like to get your
questions as we go forward because we'd
[SPEAKER_02]: like this to be an interesting
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my first question to all of you and you
can, depending on, you don't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: answer this, but I think it'd be really
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your definition of an emerging
cannabis market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any one of you, jump in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I suppose in the sense of an emerging
market, I would say it would be to a point
[SPEAKER_04]: post-legalization where there is actually
implementation of a supply chain and
[SPEAKER_04]: access to patients or patient access to
certainly qualified medicine on scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Canada has it, certain states in
the US has it, nowhere really outside of
[SPEAKER_04]: those locations actually have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can classify every other region as
an emerging market for the sake of this
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation, for the sake of this panel,
to give it some context.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what we are seeing in Europe,
what we're seeing in Latam, what we're
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing in Asia and in Australia is really
the development in unison of new access
[SPEAKER_04]: programs for patients all around the
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because there isn't a blueprint,
or certainly the blueprint of what went on
[SPEAKER_04]: in North America isn't exactly the one to
follow when it comes to these emerging
[SPEAKER_04]: markets, you're seeing new models being
implemented across the globe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really, really exciting to try
and cover.
[SPEAKER_04]: And analyze, but for companies wanting to
operate and certainly scale their
[SPEAKER_04]: business, it is exceptionally complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're in Ireland and the UK,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one kind of emerging market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, Costas, you can talk about Greece,
because I'd like to talk a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: about an emerging market clearly in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you see as your definition?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it export-focused?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a cultivation infrastructure?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it having a cannabis agency?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the kinds of things that your
idea is a definition of an emerging
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis market from Greece?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Margaret.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think that the cannabis industry
as a whole is an emerging industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So even if we talk about North America,
Canada, there's still room to grow in
[SPEAKER_06]: terms of people that have access to the
products, in terms of cultivation,
[SPEAKER_06]: manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And more importantly, what I see the
biggest bottleneck of the industry is the
[SPEAKER_06]: legislation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's room to grow on every vertical.
[SPEAKER_06]: In particular, Greece, it was one of the
first European countries actually that
[SPEAKER_06]: started to form some kind of regulation to
allow for the industry to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of the politicians saw it as an
economic opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, that left patients
behind quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And 2018 is when legislation started.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big ambiguities in legislation in terms of
what could be produced in the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, there was a very big bottleneck
that allowed only for finished products.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could only make Side of X or an
Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can understand, that was really
not something marketable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of licenses started to go out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in the first year, there was about
100 licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're about a little less than 200 right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Three years later.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really interesting because in
Greece, up until a few months ago,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have both the ruling government party
as well as the opposition supporting
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Greece did an amendment in legislation
a few months ago and kind of tried to
[SPEAKER_06]: clarify as to what can be produced under
what conditions and eventually how
[SPEAKER_06]: products will be able to get registered in
order to allow for exports and primarily
[SPEAKER_06]: flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's still not final.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's still an emerging market in what
sense?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, legislation allows for the
cultivation of flour and its export as
[SPEAKER_06]: long as you're manufacturing a second
product that's at least registered in the
[SPEAKER_06]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're bringing up a very, very
interesting discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one of the key aspects of
emerging markets is maybe products are
[SPEAKER_02]: designed either for export or you're
importing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to kind of go down to Boniface
because you're coming from Africa,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a very cool emerging market,
not only bringing stuff to Europe,
[SPEAKER_02]: but inter Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can talk about some of the
challenges and what it means to be an
[SPEAKER_02]: emerging market from Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Boniface.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't see without these.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not that weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to hide his eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in Zimbabwe, we just exported our
first crop last month.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have more than 55 licenses and out of
those 55, less than six are producing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The challenge that we have right now is
from a regulatory standpoint.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we have is we have a cannabis
industry that is still in the fledgling
[SPEAKER_05]: stages.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I mean by that is there is confusion
in regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: The regulation is not clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: So bringing in products and taking
products out is still a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_05]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you an example in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a Canadian company that just went
through the process of cultivating a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of crop that they were not able to export.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the challenges that we're
facing, they come from guys like
[SPEAKER_05]: yourselves who are well-intended and then
you come to Africa, then you want to be a
[SPEAKER_05]: cowboy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to play with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to do your own thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes business difficult in terms of
just getting what you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Work with the locals and you get what you
want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And secondly, in terms of how we're
working, there's I think an issue with
[SPEAKER_05]: regards to the work that it takes to get
the cannabis to be exported or to be
[SPEAKER_05]: imported.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned to my friends here that
everyone likes to eat sausage,
[SPEAKER_05]: but no one likes to make sausage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very nasty process.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you come to Africa, I'll do the nasty
business for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will do the nasty business for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Together, we'll get something done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here to talk about Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here to talk about the opportunities
that exist in Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have great factors in our endowments.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can come.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have land.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have sunshine.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot more to offer than what you
traditionally get down here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring your expertise to Zimbabwe and
you'll make way more money than doing your
[SPEAKER_05]: business here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul, this is my next question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that advertisement for Zimbabwe,
how would you say the emerging market in
[SPEAKER_02]: New Zealand is developing in terms of both
the creation of a domestic market and of
[SPEAKER_02]: course exports, which are now starting to
come to Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Margaret.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though New Zealand might not
really seem like an emerging market from
[SPEAKER_01]: the outside because they have really
modern regulations in place, already have
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis agency that is also
cooperating with the German cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: agency, it is really that they came up
with this medicinal cannabis scheme just
[SPEAKER_01]: in April last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal of that was to really supply
the market with some domestic high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all that was available until then
was just really like prices were really
[SPEAKER_01]: high and everything needed to be imported.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they tried is they awarded around
40 licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So around 30 for cultivation and 10 for
distribution and manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with this emerging process and
still the New Zealand government realizing
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe some of the restrictions they
put in place because they wanted to go
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really strict.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they looked at the German market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is obviously for most international
companies the most relevant market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took Germany as an example and added
some more challenges to it, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means they added some extra
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, to be registered in New
Zealand as a medicinal cannabis product,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to comply with or they will test
your product for 6 to 9 pesticides and
[SPEAKER_01]: have some additional microbial testing
applied to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really, really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they realized that some of the other
bureaucracy around it, maybe they went a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going back a bit as well on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still emerging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is like in other places around
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why it takes a bit longer for the
New Zealand companies to actually have
[SPEAKER_01]: their first harvest and comply with all
these regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think several of you here are from
countries that are really thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: exporting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, the UK and Stephen is in the UK
and Ireland.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more, I don't want to diss the
weather, but that's more of an import
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be your recommendations to
people out there about minding the gaps?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're in an emerging market and you
want to export to Germany or you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: export to another country, how would you
recommend that that process begins to
[SPEAKER_02]: start?
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially from a company perspective,
especially as regulations are also
[SPEAKER_02]: evolving, to your point, because it's just
about everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I think 99% of countries and
locations should be import.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think we, as an industry,
are so caught up in the side of
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation, we forget about the rest of
the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And countries ultimately forget about the
rest of the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So great, we have product, but how do we
actually get it implemented into the hands
[SPEAKER_04]: of patient?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's the process behind
reimbursement and so forth?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is so much talk of cultivation,
cultivation, and product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, obviously, it is exceptionally
important, but there's one or two
[SPEAKER_04]: facilities in Europe alone that can cater
for the rest of the demand that Europe
[SPEAKER_04]: will need for the next five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, nobody talks about that
elephant in the room in terms of how much
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation actually happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: We only need to look at Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a great article two weeks ago by
Matt Lammers from MJ Biz, who talked about
[SPEAKER_04]: 80% of cannabis being produced that has
been destroyed, purely down to pure,
[SPEAKER_04]: purely down to kind of ignorance when it
comes to mapping the forecasted demand and
[SPEAKER_04]: also the understanding in terms of who the
customers were and what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, the focus of import and
export and the rush to cultivation,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think is overvalued and certainly over
forced by the hands of the investors who
[SPEAKER_04]: want to see significant capital returns,
because that is ultimately where,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you are seeing the large
multiples traditionally come from.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I do think that there is
sufficient supply in production or in
[SPEAKER_04]: production cycle to cater for demand in
Europe for the next 10 years easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, there is obviously a benefit
of having domestic supply and not being
[SPEAKER_04]: reliable on anybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, this is just another supply
chain, just another product at the end of
[SPEAKER_04]: the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, why should it be different to anything
else that exists?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is no other industry that takes
this, I suppose, domestic first approach
[SPEAKER_04]: where everything needs to be integrated in
the country in order to, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: achieve growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the UK is, well, the UK is import and
export, but it is exports for a very
[SPEAKER_04]: specific circumstance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is only starting to emerge in terms
of providing domestic cultivation
[SPEAKER_04]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there is huge risk
associated with cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And whereas what the UK has probably
benefited more from is looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: innovation around the plant, so the
science around the plant, but also the
[SPEAKER_04]: supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, everything from delivery services to
clinics to doctor education.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have kind of built these elements
out that has benefited the patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there is obviously still issues
around pricing and still issues around
[SPEAKER_04]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And supply, but that is probably common in
every emerging industry and every emerging
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, these are kind of growing pains that
exist in the UK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's as a result of not
having domestic cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just as a result of,
you know, capital being exceptionally
[SPEAKER_04]: tight in any emerging industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the UK, at least in my
opinion, I think the UK is a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: different than, say, Greece or New Zealand
or Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to come back to Costas for a
second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think one of the issues in
Greece is obviously there is a clear focus
[SPEAKER_02]: on the export market, but there has also
been, I think, going forward, a real focus
[SPEAKER_02]: on trying to also make sure that Greek
patients can get, you know, cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can talk a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that there is quite a few
more European countries that don't allow
[SPEAKER_06]: patient access.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not only Greece.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was your question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I think from your
perspective, what are some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges that companies face in Greece?
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, they want to make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to satisfy their investors and
they want to export.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of people that I'm talking to
definitely also want to help patients and
[SPEAKER_02]: develop the local markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you suggest that, you know,
well, I would say, what is your opinion on
[SPEAKER_02]: how that is proceeding in Greece?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the challenges and how do you
think that the industry itself can rise to
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most people want to make sure that
patients everywhere get stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just if you're exporting to another
country.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it is, you know, cannabis has always
been political.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that the biggest issue for the
European Union, you know, and its
[SPEAKER_06]: respective countries, its country members,
you know, the political risk of applying
[SPEAKER_06]: some form of, you know, cannabis
legalization and allowing the,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, intra-European trade,
it gives a lot of risk and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_06]: political parties are very afraid of how
that is going to interpret to the voters.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I think that we're getting more
and more evidence of, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: with what's happening in the United
States, you know, what happened in Canada,
[SPEAKER_06]: Mexico, that there's a lot of more
pressure now that this is a real industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And more importantly, it's an industry
that affects, you know, sick people to one
[SPEAKER_06]: extent.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, you know,
it's about a well-being of the citizens.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that what we're going to start
to see in the very near future is that
[SPEAKER_06]: people, you know, as the industry becomes
more legitimate, and legitimate meaning,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, there's actually, because the
first couple of years, year and a half,
[SPEAKER_06]: there was a lot of wishful thinking,
a lot of licenses, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's going to be, you know, half a billion
and, you know, trillion, gazillion-dollar
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's still yet to come to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So another big challenge that I see is
that people did not really understand how
[SPEAKER_06]: much time it takes from the time that you,
you know, you get your license,
[SPEAKER_06]: or even before that, till the time you're
able to have product market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's been companies that two years
ago, three years ago, started to,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, to incorporate and apply for the
licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to start to see the fruits
of those, you know, those tries now,
[SPEAKER_06]: three years later.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a specific market now that is
growing at a certain pace.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, you know, we'll agree with Steve
that more product is going to be coming
[SPEAKER_06]: into market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we're going to start to see a
competition in, you know, in the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not about just having EUGMP flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Patients and, you know, the people in
Germany are going to have a selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to start to see product
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to start to see certain
products to be preferred over others.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the same time, as more product is
coming to the market, there's going to be,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, a price war.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those companies that are able to,
to cultivate at lower cost are going to
[SPEAKER_06]: have a greater profit, greater margin to
reduce their prices.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're starting to see a shift in the
criteria that people are, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: selecting their products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, at the same time, when it comes down
to Greece, there's probably going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: not, you know, most likely we're going to
see at least one company rolling out
[SPEAKER_06]: product within 2022, I should say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Companies, local partners with Israeli
exporters, local expertise, and
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody's paying close attention to them
to see how they're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: navigate the local, you know, regulatory
authorities in terms of registering their
[SPEAKER_06]: products and exporting it to Germany and
other jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think as far as Greece goes,
within the next six to eight months,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're going to come to see exactly how the
system will work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now we're, there's a lot of
ambiguity and there's people that still
[SPEAKER_06]: see a lot of challenges, but that's going
to clear up within the next few months.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to actually skip down to the
end here with, with, with Paul and
[SPEAKER_02]: Boniface, because I think that the
certainly Greece, most people are looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at European export, but within Africa,
there's like an Africa to Africa trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think also, Paul, if you can
talk about maybe not just coming to
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe, but maybe looking at other markets
like Israel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Within Africa, we have not developed a
domestic market.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could tell you, for example,
in South Africa, you can cultivate,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you cannot extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you cultivate, you send it out,
then you import your stuff back in.
[SPEAKER_05]: How ridiculous is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very, very ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Such inconsistency in regulation is what
keeps investors away.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in Zimbabwe, we understand the power
of political will.
[SPEAKER_05]: So cannabis is right at the president's
desk.
[SPEAKER_05]: The president himself is in charge of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give you something here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a five year tax holiday for
anyone who will come and farm cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five years, you don't pay tax.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to bring your money back to
Germany?
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to bring it back to America?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can expatriate all your profits,
bring them back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure by now you can tell that I'm
fighting for Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unashamedly, because you guys are all here
for your own agenda.
[SPEAKER_05]: My agenda is cannabis and Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would like you to know that we are
open for business for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want Zimbabwe to be like how Brazil is
for sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want that Silicon Valley type of
recognition for cannabis in Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to raise the floor for our
standard of living.
[SPEAKER_05]: We come here to Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys live so well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have electricity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your trains run on time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis has got the potential to unleash
a good, sustainable industry for my people
[SPEAKER_05]: so that our floor is a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to be shitting in the bush.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Boniface, I'm sorry to interrupt the
commercial here, but I mean, are you
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at, are you, for example,
are people in Zimbabwe more looking at an
[SPEAKER_02]: inter-African trade or are they looking
more at Europe or?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first and foremost, we're going to
look to export.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything we make in Africa, in
agriculture especially, is for export
[SPEAKER_05]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have made it such that we rely on your
foreign currency.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we cannot live if we don't sell you
this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to sell it to you first.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that, maybe we can educate
our people on how to use this lovely plant
[SPEAKER_05]: because we were using it for thousands of
years until some propaganda came.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clearly, though, I mean, there is
already African cannabis going to Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe, Paul, you can talk a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the New Zealand perspective,
how do you see your emerging market
[SPEAKER_02]: developing with sort of a diverse export
ideal, not just coming to Europe,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also going to other markets like
Israel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, those regulations that were
passed last year, they aimed at the New
[SPEAKER_01]: Zealand market just decreasing the
dependency on those exports.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Stephen said, and this is the main goal
that New Zealand currently had,
[SPEAKER_01]: since they were so dependent and they had
those super high regulations, which,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, are now helpful if you're
looking to export because New Zealand has
[SPEAKER_01]: already some of the highest regulations in
the world, which will allow us to export.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, of course, this came into place to
decrease dependency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And given the number of companies in New
Zealand, and really, I mean, if you know
[SPEAKER_01]: New Zealand, it's a beautiful country,
but, of course, it is a very small market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not just talking about cannabis
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking, in general, for any product
that a New Zealand company makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of New Zealand companies are looking
to export.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically a born global no matter
what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those really high standards allow the New
Zealand companies to then export to
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is currently, I would say,
the highest priority for New Zealand
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, of course, they're also looking to
Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, of course, Israel would also be in
those top three markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: To look at for New Zealand companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think what everybody is kind of
getting a sense of, if they didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: already, is going country to country with
cannabis is a bit of a risky proposition
[SPEAKER_02]: to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to throw this out to all of
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you say are some of the best
risk mitigation techniques that companies
[SPEAKER_02]: can start to think about?
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be hiring local.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be looking at, say, reaching an
EU GMT standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the kinds of things that you're
seeing in your own markets that are
[SPEAKER_02]: helping cultivators and producers meet the
challenge of basically being a developing
[SPEAKER_02]: market and then exporting to another
developing market?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take a stab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the days of the investment
decks where companies have flags planted
[SPEAKER_04]: all around the world are kind of
outnumbered, thankfully.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really as a result of the
realization of just how difficult
[SPEAKER_04]: executing international growth and
international business development can be.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have worked in probably around 40-odd
countries over the last five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, when we work with clients,
one of the key things is on local
[SPEAKER_04]: partnership.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is local expertise who understand
not only the legal system and have legal
[SPEAKER_04]: partners, but also can develop the
commercial interests when you or they are
[SPEAKER_04]: not there to take care of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that could be everybody from in,
for instance, in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be anybody from a distribution
partner all the way through to medical and
[SPEAKER_04]: science.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's that type of partnership that is
critical for any business that wants to
[SPEAKER_04]: flourish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to come in and employ a brand
manager or a country manager and have them
[SPEAKER_04]: execute organically is exceptionally
difficult, because I suppose what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: missing out on is the years of experience
and in such an early stage of the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, it is a race.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a land grab to acquire market share
or certainly for us to market in a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: sense and market ownership.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is from patient access.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is from owning areas of the supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you can own them and lock them
down, it is very hard to disrupt them in
[SPEAKER_04]: this period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So having local partners, I think,
has been exceptionally helpful for you see
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the companies and certainly some
of the clever companies who have made
[SPEAKER_04]: quite strong strategic acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think there is a little froth in
the market, but nowhere near what you see
[SPEAKER_04]: in North America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I think the last ICBC was here in
Berlin in 2019.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is probably a cap on company
valuation, European company valuations,
[SPEAKER_04]: probably in the, let's say, 30 to 40
million was probably where the top
[SPEAKER_04]: European company was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, fast forward around a year and a half
and you're around 200, 250.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's phenomenal growth for strong
European assets, but it's pennies on the
[SPEAKER_04]: dollar when you realize just how big this
market can be and the potential size of
[SPEAKER_04]: these companies in comparison to what
we're seeing in North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was a very, very,
thank you for that very comprehensive
[SPEAKER_02]: response.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to actually throw this out to
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell the audience or entertain
them maybe with any either success or
[SPEAKER_02]: horror stories that you might have come
across about companies that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sally forth and either get into trouble or
have managed to overcome some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges that I think everybody is
talking about and referencing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, talking about success,
I'm really happy that we now have two of
[SPEAKER_01]: those New Zealand companies I'm working
with and supporting in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have agreements in place with German
wholesalers and importers, which was,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, a really big step for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would definitely count this as a
really great success story for New Zealand
[SPEAKER_01]: and for the local industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there's way more company
that now take this as inspiration to also
[SPEAKER_01]: look for partners here in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, I think in general,
if you're looking at the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a success story for the country
because if you're looking at New Zealand,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the land is owned by the Maori
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so New Zealand puts a lot of resources
and support in that to support the local
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that is partly run by Maori.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the great thing is we already heard
that yesterday in Jamie's keynote,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe, that she said we're moving away
from money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yes, money is still very
important, but we're looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: well-being, for sustainability and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think really this is where New
Zealand has done a really big step because
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're looking at those Maori
businesses that grow the cannabis there,
[SPEAKER_01]: they really put the money into the local
community and really help the region,
[SPEAKER_01]: the rural areas grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that Paul, you're bringing
up a big point that we were all discussing
[SPEAKER_02]: in the back room, which is cannabis as a
tool of economic development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Costas and Boniface, you can talk a
little bit about the emerging economic and
[SPEAKER_02]: incentive environment that is allowing the
industry to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me start with Costas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that most of the European
countries, they're already offering
[SPEAKER_06]: European grants, incentives that are in
most cases I know for a fact it works for
[SPEAKER_06]: Portugal, it works for Greece.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not familiar with any other country,
but I'm sure it's the same mechanism that
[SPEAKER_06]: gets implemented.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're able to provide grants with
specific percentages up to like 30,
[SPEAKER_06]: 40% of construction cost or greenhouse
construction, depending on how far.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get more money the further out you are
from major cities.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is a great financial incentive
where you're looking at putting together
[SPEAKER_06]: like a 10 million euro facility,
you could get a couple million,
[SPEAKER_06]: two, three million based on the location.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, that creates another potential
challenge, which is, okay, if you're going
[SPEAKER_06]: to go in a remote village in Greece that
nobody really wants to go and live there,
[SPEAKER_06]: where are you going to find your
workforce?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go back a little bit to the
risk mitigation question that you said.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that one of the most important
aspects that a lot of people miss in the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry is that you need to educate
yourself about the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to learn and make sure that you
have clear and real expectations as to
[SPEAKER_06]: where the industry is right now,
where it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because right now, you're looking to put a
facility together that's going to have
[SPEAKER_06]: product ready probably in about two and a
half to three years from now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how are you setting those expectations?
[SPEAKER_06]: And looking at those strong partners,
I mean, I work for a company that we
[SPEAKER_06]: manufacture EUGMP equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have people all over the world
reaching out to us and like, well,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we're going to get into
extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to buy equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And talking about those horror stories,
I come across at least three different
[SPEAKER_06]: companies that had already paid,
you know, three, 400,000 euros worth of
[SPEAKER_06]: equipment that didn't have a CE marking
and could not cross the border and get
[SPEAKER_06]: into Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's funny because the people that
actually ordered that equipment were based
[SPEAKER_06]: in either Canada or the United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it wasn't people that are outside of
the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: They knew what's being used, but they seem
to have missed this little piece of
[SPEAKER_06]: information.
[SPEAKER_06]: EUGMP has been another big challenge for
many.
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to be a challenge up until a
couple of years ago until we came to see
[SPEAKER_06]: how companies came to overcome that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that a common practice in
Europe has been to bring people in from
[SPEAKER_06]: the pharma industry, work closely with
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there has been a lot of people that
were promising EUGMP, yeah, we know it,
[SPEAKER_06]: we can do it, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the only people that were actually to
pull it off were people that brought the
[SPEAKER_06]: people in, worked with them, and actually
kept that knowledge in-house, developed
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they kept it kind of secret.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to me, in terms of mitigating that
risk, is work with people that have proven
[SPEAKER_06]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as passion, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Boniface was talking about this is
one of the greatest things about working
[SPEAKER_02]: in an emerging market.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's youth, there's activism,
there's passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you say that the role of that
and the importance of that is in
[SPEAKER_02]: developing markets like Zimbabwe,
for example?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where we are today is probably where the
rest of the world was five years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot of optimism.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I came to Berlin, I thought I was
going to be the next CBD smokeable flower
[SPEAKER_05]: king.
[SPEAKER_05]: But after one day, I grew from this big
and I feel this small right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's good because everyone here that
I've had a chance to interact with has
[SPEAKER_05]: taken the time to teach me what's going on
in the industry to allow my expectations
[SPEAKER_05]: to be more realistic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I not only represent myself, I represent a
nation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the hopes of a nation lie with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The vice president came on TV the other
day, said, we have $1.5 billion of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis that we're going to sell this
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't even sold $2 million.
[SPEAKER_05]: You understand?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that optimism, I'm sure everyone here
has had it before with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a new industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just needs to be checked.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to be practical about what to
expect and when to expect it and how to
[SPEAKER_05]: expect it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to speak a little bit further on the
opportunities that exist, I think before
[SPEAKER_05]: we address the opportunities, we need to
look at education and regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: People in my country need to be educated
on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the same as Europe and North
America.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a huge stigma.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to educate our doctors,
our pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to create a local market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make sure that before we even
start talking about the bigger things,
[SPEAKER_05]: that the basic foundation to allow there
to be a cannabis national master plan,
[SPEAKER_05]: so to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to make a national master
plan where we're putting cannabis in our
[SPEAKER_05]: curriculum to get kids learning about this
plant because we understand the value that
[SPEAKER_05]: this plant has and we want to unleash its
potential in Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm actually going to come back to Paul
here for a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: How important is it to network ahead of
time and know that not only you're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: a crop in your own country, but figuring
out where you have to go and where you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to target?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it so important to find
international partners in that process?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think where you're touching on there is
kind of like going back to the mitigation
[SPEAKER_01]: risk because I think it's really crucial
to have this partner who understands the
[SPEAKER_01]: local market and this is why networking is
more than important than ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though if you're looking at the New
Zealand companies, they haven't exported
[SPEAKER_01]: really like a big quantity yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still in an early stage and all they
have shipped is samples so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really good for also the economic
stability of those companies to already
[SPEAKER_01]: have supply agreements in place,
which they have domestically, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why networking is very,
very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve, I'm actually going to come back to
you for a second because the UK actually
[SPEAKER_02]: is a very, very interesting case.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was a couple of years ago still
that the UK was the major, the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: export country for cannabis in the world,
not Canada or anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that kind of dynamic create
domestically?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the tension there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose it's quite elite and controlled.
[SPEAKER_04]: The UK has been producing cannabis near
about 20 years and what you have had is
[SPEAKER_04]: you have had this cut off from actual
patients while it's gone through,
[SPEAKER_04]: I suppose, a pharma route.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been, I suppose, within the
cannabis industry and certainly within the
[SPEAKER_04]: patient community, there's been a lot of
friction between the types of groups who
[SPEAKER_04]: have gone down the pharma route and it's
understandable going down the pharma
[SPEAKER_04]: route, it does take significant time
investment and you do want to protect that
[SPEAKER_04]: investment as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a contrast insofar as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the basics of it in the
early stage of cultivation, there is a
[SPEAKER_04]: product there ready for patients to use
and consume and there is, I suppose,
[SPEAKER_04]: friction that the decision hasn't been
made to allow that access early days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that has been rectified and patients
are getting access under a very still
[SPEAKER_04]: strict manner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And protocol, but you definitely have
tension insofar as why is this elite group
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed access and it has cut off and why
is the government not engaging on this
[SPEAKER_04]: dialogue?
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of that is obviously down to
cannabis has been the most politically
[SPEAKER_04]: friendly conversation of the last 20
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now thankfully, I think every single
country is adapting their tone and
[SPEAKER_04]: openness and transparency around
discussing cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the broader education that this
isn't something that kills and this isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: a reef of madness.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we've seen sweeping changes
across the globe that cannabis is no
[SPEAKER_04]: longer the political hot potato that it
used to be and a politician can come to a
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis conference free from the stigma
where most of us wear sharp suits and we
[SPEAKER_04]: speak in a very professional manner.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's relatively new, this B2B side
where we talk of implementation of a
[SPEAKER_04]: proper commercial and responsible
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the industry is just being
hampered, if you will, by a lack of
[SPEAKER_04]: collective individuals who are informed on
the topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think when we started Prohibition
Partners a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to actually invest in the space,
invest in Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean opportunities, but there is very
little information out there as to what
[SPEAKER_04]: was happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think events like these are
absolutely critical for us to come and
[SPEAKER_04]: share ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we may disagree or we may think that
there is better ways to do it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that is all part of the process and
certainly something that should be
[SPEAKER_04]: welcomed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I've got another question and I'd
love this to be around Robin.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your favorite developing market
that's not yours and why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Start with Kostas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, I have to love Germany,
of course, because it's by far the,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, you know, and to be more specific on
the patient access only.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is really surprising how Germany,
a country that always focuses on exports,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, has only granted three licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a feeling that this might change
pretty soon just based on, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: previous track record, but we'll get to
see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I mean, Malta has been doing a
great job, you know, both government led
[SPEAKER_06]: and, you know, Malta enterprise has been
doing a great job promoting the
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunities in the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that there's been,
although a small country, but they have
[SPEAKER_06]: created a really interesting scheme of how
they can work as a hub.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although not a European Union country,
but within the European continent,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that North Macedonia has a lot of
potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you think that North Macedonia has
so much potential?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's, you know, if I were to
compare it, I mean, there's pretty similar
[SPEAKER_06]: climate, you know, with Greece and
Portugal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we speak about climate,
it's not only, I mean, when you're,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, cultivating it in EUGMP or GCP
environment, I think that the climate does
[SPEAKER_06]: play, you know, a certain role,
but not that big of, it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_06]: make that big of a difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it is, you know, low electricity,
you know, low labor costs.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're able to overcome EUGMP,
and I think that they have a government
[SPEAKER_06]: that's really supportive of the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I spoke with a few people over
the last few days, there, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: we should be expecting some changes in
that part of the world as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Portugal has been, I think,
the leading country in terms of,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, cultivation and 2022 is going
to, we're really going to see a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivation, a lot of flower coming out of
Portugal.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I think that, you know,
I mean, Denmark, of course, is,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, it's a more established market
in the sense that, you know, exactly
[SPEAKER_06]: what's going on, a lot of transparency.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've been, you know, as Vitalis,
we've, you know, we've already deployed
[SPEAKER_06]: equipment there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's been companies that are really
producing, you know, pharmaceutical-grade
[SPEAKER_06]: extracts, let's say.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really like countries that there is
stability, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's countries with great potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: The risk might seem to be there at the
moment, but I think that if you're working
[SPEAKER_06]: with people that, you know, local people
that have been in the industry,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can kind of safeguard your investment.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, you know, those are the
countries that... Beyond here,
[SPEAKER_02]: what about down towards non-European
countries within Africa or Thailand or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, further afield, China?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to go with Germany as my favorite
emerging market, besides New Zealand,
[SPEAKER_01]: but since Kostas claimed that,
I will go with Israel, because I think
[SPEAKER_01]: there's also definitely still a lot of
potential for companies exporting there,
[SPEAKER_01]: because as I understand, there's a
domestic production, but of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's still some room for some
high-quality products there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there is this taste in
Israel, or this preference for flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than just processed products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this would definitely be very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you just mentioned Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know the details,
but I know that some of the New Zealand
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are also kind of looking into
Thailand and the current developments
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually got a question for Boniface.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for example, Morocco has got
changing, you know, legalization laws,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: From your perspective, just within Africa,
where would you say are like the hot
[SPEAKER_02]: countries besides South Africa and...
Besides South Africa and Zimbabwe,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was actually surprised that the lady
from New Frontier Data didn't mention
[SPEAKER_05]: Lesotho.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lesotho is producing and exporting more
than Zimbabwe and South Africa put
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what we call Lesotho back
home?
[SPEAKER_05]: We call it the kingdom of mischief.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they just legalized psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are legalizing anything and
everything in Lesotho.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm excited about Lesotho.
[SPEAKER_05]: Check it out too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I'm going to throw this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have any questions for the
panelists here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to ask about any regions?
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got more... None?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it all going to be just commodities?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I feel like cannabis in this
global marketplace is moving really more
[SPEAKER_00]: toward a cigarette style of production as
opposed to say a wine or a beer style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like everybody's looking for
that, for like giant mega farms and huge
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of exporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where's the craft?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there space for that in any of these
countries, in any of these spaces?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's definitely room for that in
New Zealand because a lot of the companies
[SPEAKER_01]: there are actually really, really small.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with all these cultivators and
producers of then products from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, we're not talking high volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be very specialized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the companies in New Zealand,
the people behind it, they all have a very
[SPEAKER_01]: strong pharmaceutical background.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're actually looking to not just
export flour, but moving into value-add
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about extracts and other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because this also, let's say,
kind of, from my perspective, saves your
[SPEAKER_01]: business in the medical space if we're
talking about legalization in other
[SPEAKER_01]: countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then you have this extract,
this liquid, and because you know that a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the patients or some of the
patients, they would not necessarily like
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke or vaporize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why actually New Zealand
companies definitely focus on the
[SPEAKER_01]: value-add products in the long run and not
just exporting flours in mass,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just like small quantities right now,
but high quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve, I was hoping you might talk a
little bit about the CBD craft industry in
[SPEAKER_02]: the UK a little bit, or is there one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, craft is an odd term when you put to
cannabis because ultimately what it just
[SPEAKER_04]: means is consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we continue to lack in this
industry is consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the small batch of producers who have
been able to produce consistency are now
[SPEAKER_04]: termed craft.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a nice premium and sound
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think in this stage of the industry,
the level of craft is still a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: far out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have consumers who are only just
starting to understand what they want and
[SPEAKER_04]: what they like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the volume of, I suppose, frequency of
products in the market is still quite
[SPEAKER_04]: minimal, especially in Europe in terms of
what choice you have and product
[SPEAKER_04]: availability.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD craft markets, rightly or wrongly,
I'm quite skeptical of the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you have a large number of players
who are promoting these CBD craft brands
[SPEAKER_04]: that if you look at the production chain,
they all come from the exact same contract
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have this right across Europe,
and these are fooling the consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is not building any sort of true
education and true brand credibility with
[SPEAKER_04]: either the productized CBD or the brand
itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that obviously comes from early stage
industry and misconception on both sides
[SPEAKER_04]: of the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you will, of course, have consumers
who want differentiation, who want
[SPEAKER_04]: personalization and different experiences.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are seeing brand masters from pharma,
from food and drink, from retail move into
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are spicy-looking CBD brands and
products out there, all from cosmetics to
[SPEAKER_04]: beauty to health and wellness and food and
drink, starting to emerge now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether there is a big enough CBD market
in the UK under the existing regulations
[SPEAKER_04]: to maintain that is still up for debate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're all hoping, they're seeing
what has happened in North American market
[SPEAKER_04]: where there is a THC opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that transition to THC and consumer
demand for those type of product
[SPEAKER_04]: variations is obviously off the chart.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's an exciting testing stage,
but it comes with a huge and huge,
[SPEAKER_04]: huge amount of risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kostas, did you want to add to that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just want to, you know,
that was a great question.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I must say that for the longest time
that I always thought of, I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're an extraction equipment
manufacturing company.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm very less familiar with
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it's something that I really
enjoy talking about and listening to
[SPEAKER_06]: about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to thank Tyler yesterday.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a great discussion from Valeos.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the craft industry, you know,
he made a really nice company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the size of the craft industry is
between three to 10 metric tons of
[SPEAKER_06]: production per year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that this is what we're seeing in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought it was going to be much less.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that this is substantial.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it fits perfectly the European
cultivation model of the facilities that
[SPEAKER_06]: we're seeing being built now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the longest time, I thought that,
yes, of course, you know, cannabis is
[SPEAKER_06]: similar to tomatoes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be commoditization.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think that is true.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the cannabis consumer and,
you know, let's let's call the spade a
[SPEAKER_06]: spade.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, to me, it is not really defined
where this adult use and where does
[SPEAKER_06]: medical use in terms of, you know,
specifically for flour, where,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, how many people are,
you know, purchasing cannabis in Germany
[SPEAKER_06]: for medical use and how many for adult use
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that there is a lot of overlap,
but, you know, we're starting to see over
[SPEAKER_06]: the last year, at least, that even the
demand in Germany is increasing primarily
[SPEAKER_06]: for, you know, people that are paying for
cannabis privately.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that over the next year,
year and a half, we're going to start to
[SPEAKER_06]: see a significant increase in the quantity
that's been in the market in Germany for
[SPEAKER_06]: people that are, you know, using both for
both usages.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I always assimilate the cannabis
consumer as like, you know, the coffee
[SPEAKER_06]: consumer or the wine consumer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, you can go to Starbucks and get
an espresso, but I really like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, an espresso from a little,
you know, Italian coffee shop and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, or somebody that's, you know,
a Colombian coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't mean that I won't buy coffee
from Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I if I, you know, if I have access
to that other product, I would much rather
[SPEAKER_06]: enjoy that coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that this is it's harder a lot
because Starbucks can afford to have all
[SPEAKER_00]: the nice locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the little mom and pop,
they can't pay the rent on the gentrified
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now where do you go to get your little
fancy coffee?
[SPEAKER_06]: The cannabis has been distributed through
pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, the same pharmacy could have
the same products.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, this is where we're going
to see the the product differentiation
[SPEAKER_06]: coming to play really strongly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when, you know, when when when Tyler is
cultivating, you know, this you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: this product that he's been cultivating in
the United States for the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's right next to,
you know, a large Canadian company that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, has a like I'm not going to even
get into the potencies, but there is
[SPEAKER_06]: differences in the cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I had to choose, I would much rather
go for, you know, a product that has come
[SPEAKER_06]: from the craft industry versus,
you know, the big names, let's say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you actually raised an interesting
question here because we're all talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about international exports, but no one
has really talked about developing
[SPEAKER_02]: countries exporting into the United
States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I would start with Boniface.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that is that something that is on the
drawing board in Zimbabwe or throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: Africa?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it just too difficult?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's difficult because hemp is really
cheap in the States.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in California, I got buddies who
stopped growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm convincing them to move to Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's that's difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: But going back to the previous question
about the products, what I see the future
[SPEAKER_05]: of cannabis and cannabis products,
I think of if you go to a restaurant and
[SPEAKER_05]: you look at a table, there's salt and
pepper, there's sugar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we'd like to have, you know,
cannabis products right there,
[SPEAKER_05]: just like salt and pepper and sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're sort of getting to the end
of the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: No questions out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to work now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Nim from Israel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone's speaking about cannabis as
a commodity, as a commodity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Israel, we're importing around like
just our companies are importing one point
[SPEAKER_03]: two tons per year of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a kind of sewer product like the
market is looking for more quality than
[SPEAKER_03]: quantity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they want quality and quantity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, everyone here is speaking about
cannabis as a commodity, sugar or
[SPEAKER_03]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hemp is a commodity.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD is a commodity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis in my eyes, of course,
and in the Israeli market, they're looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for premium, premium, premium product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't heard anything about this,
the quality and of these products and
[SPEAKER_03]: importing and exporting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think you're asking about the
EUGMP issue or producing for GMP for
[SPEAKER_02]: export.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think once you go to the regulations,
EUGMP or control union and you lose a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of the quality for because of the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we've been seeing,
because everyone's growing their capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have EUGMP, it costs you a lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to have a lot of quantity to
let's say to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see how you can have an EUGMP or for
import and have also the quality of T20
[SPEAKER_03]: and terpene profiles of like three and a
half percent with these huge facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that what you're talking
about actually is the dichotomy between
[SPEAKER_02]: having a regulated certified market,
which is GMP standard versus the other
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think certainly there was a little
bit of disagreement up here that you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: have that in a GMP environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would anybody like to tackle that one?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm not a cultivation expert,
but I strongly suggest that you speak with
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the... And if you don't know
anybody, I can introduce you to a couple
[SPEAKER_06]: to dive deeper in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But from my understanding, you're able to
cultivate quality under EUGMP.
[SPEAKER_06]: The drying process is where you might be
losing some... Because cultivation is
[SPEAKER_06]: GACP.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it shouldn't really affect the quality
of the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right about the incentive of
certain cultivators to cultivate high THC
[SPEAKER_06]: potent plants because they could get more
money for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because actually, you're getting paid
based on the THC potency and CBD potency
[SPEAKER_06]: versus the rest of the flamanoids and the
terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is an incentive to get a higher
price for other products, but this is a
[SPEAKER_06]: decision that the cultivator should take
when it comes down to, okay, do I go for a
[SPEAKER_06]: product that's 18% THC, get a little bit
less money for it, but maybe get larger
[SPEAKER_06]: market share in the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not quite clear if I answered you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have time for one more question?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we do not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we have a round of applause for our
distinguished panelists?
Thank you so much.
