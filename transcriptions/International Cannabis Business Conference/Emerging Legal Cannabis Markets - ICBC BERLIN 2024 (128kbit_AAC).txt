[SPEAKER_06]: Emerging cannabis legal markets,
and to lead us in this, the founder and
[SPEAKER_06]: CEO for the Hyde Advisory and Investments
Incorporated, the one and only David Hyde.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what an amazing time to be in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The global cannabis sector is finally
showing signs of accelerating growth after
[SPEAKER_02]: many years of slow what we might call
grinding progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a few grinders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out in the audience today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Partial legalization in Germany,
developments in the United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: progress in key European and global
jurisdictions on medical and rec pilots,
[SPEAKER_02]: and market growth in countries like
Australia, Germany, Israel, followed by
[SPEAKER_02]: UK, Poland, Brazil, and more, are the
catalysts for this new found and long
[SPEAKER_02]: awaited momentum.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on the precipice, it seems to me,
of something big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, more than ever, the topic of emerging
cannabis markets is a really hot
[SPEAKER_02]: commodity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what is an emerging market?
[SPEAKER_02]: What lessons can be learned from the
growth of other more mature markets?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the key emerging markets?
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought together a diverse group of
leading minds from different parts of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis sector globally to discuss our
topic today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm David Hyde, CEO of Hyde Advisory and
Investments.
[SPEAKER_02]: HAI is a boutique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canadian based advisory firm, brokering M
&A and strategic investment deals across
[SPEAKER_02]: the global cannabis space, successfully
closing 12 deals in 2023.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob Perot, to my left, is a respected
advocate and thought leader within the
[SPEAKER_02]: indigenous cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: With extensive experience navigating both
regulatory challenges and market
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities, he represents organizations
working towards the international
[SPEAKER_02]: expansion and empowerment of indigenous
led cannabis enterprises.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next to him is Kohei Yamada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kohei is the founder and CEO of Kiseki
Group, the first Japanese vertically
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated medical cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kohei's subsidiary company, Kiseki Plant
Factory Thailand, has made significant
[SPEAKER_02]: strides in cultivating
pharmaceutical-grade medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_02]: Bangkok, Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next to him, Zach George, is the CEO of
Canadian publicly listed license producer,
[SPEAKER_02]: SNDL.
[SPEAKER_02]: SNDL is one of Canada's premier vertically
integrated cannabis enterprises.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zach is a seasoned executive and
entrepreneur with a diverse 20-year
[SPEAKER_02]: investment and executive leadership
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next to him, Patti Holmes has over 15
years experience in the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: industry with a particular focus on
medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: She co-founded one of Australia's first
publicly listed medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: companies and is now working as a
consultant in the novel therapeutic space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patti is also the executive officer of the
Medicinal Cannabis Industry Association
[SPEAKER_02]: where she plays an integral role in
supporting and advocating for the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's our crew for today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if everyone's buckled in, let's go for
a ride on emerging markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to start, if I can, Patti,
at the end with yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put this question to you
about the market in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia was picked as one of the fastest
growing medical cannabis markets in 2023.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did it grow so fast, in your opinion,
and what are the implications for other
[SPEAKER_02]: emerging cannabis markets?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was really interesting that
Australia was selected as one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fastest growing markets because it's so
hard to get transparent data on actually
[SPEAKER_01]: what is happening in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the reasons that Australia
has been so successful is that we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: very good reputation for drug development
and pharmaceutical industry experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's recognized with all the other
main regulators in the US and the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's quite a few mutual recognition
programs that we've been able to tap into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think because we do so much
drug discovery and development that when
[SPEAKER_01]: our regulator, the TGA, went to establish
the prescribing power pathways and the
[SPEAKER_01]: product access pathways, they were very
clever in that we already had a special
[SPEAKER_01]: access scheme for unregistered medicine,
but we didn't have the issue where,
[SPEAKER_01]: in so many other countries, that GPs
weren't able to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as the person was medically
registered, be the person a GP or a
[SPEAKER_01]: specialist, they were both able to
prescribe medicinal cannabis, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: also weren't as specific about the
indications that you could prescribe for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as the doctor could clinically
justify the indication, our regulator was
[SPEAKER_01]: happy with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with the product access pathways,
I mean, Australia is very far from the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of the world, and so I think the way
that when it was first regulated,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was obviously no industry in
Australia, so they made imports for
[SPEAKER_01]: pathways very, not easily navigated,
but there was a pathway, there was an
[SPEAKER_01]: established pathway, and it was well
defined.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the combination of having
product accessible and prescribers willing
[SPEAKER_01]: to prescribe really helped us with the
understanding of our regulator.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great, Patti.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, I think, highlights really why
Australia has become one of the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis powerhouses in terms of its
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the key facets there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zach, turning to you, as the first G20
nation to legalize recreational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada is a great case study for emerging
markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Canada, there have been challenges
related to product supply, oversupply,
[SPEAKER_02]: retail saturation, regulatory challenges,
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: What should other emerging markets
consider in developing long-term
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainability in a nascent market?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, David.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can come at this from a couple
angles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly, there's a lot to learn from in
terms of the Canadian case study.
[SPEAKER_04]: First and foremost, when you compare it to
one of the larger and more mature markets
[SPEAKER_04]: in the US, Canada is an example of what
can occur when you have a national market
[SPEAKER_04]: for flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are some signs and indications at
the physical plant level and in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: costs and the commodity risk that is
inherent in the space that will certainly
[SPEAKER_04]: rear its head as we get to interstate
commerce across the US sometime in the
[SPEAKER_04]: future.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other factors that are very relevant
to Europe, I think that the rampant
[SPEAKER_04]: overlicensing which drove material
oversupply in Canada and the lack of
[SPEAKER_04]: enforcement, believe it or not,
which has put the government in a position
[SPEAKER_04]: where they are the largest creditor to the
industry in Canada is a real problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, the current state of arrears when
it comes to excise tax in Canada has
[SPEAKER_04]: become so large that it's actually larger
than my estimate of what the wholesale
[SPEAKER_04]: market would represent in Germany for the
entire year this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So seriously problematic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Canadian LPs and participants in this
industry have gone through a lot of trauma
[SPEAKER_04]: in the last five years, which impacts
memory.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to put a positive spin on it as well,
what you're seeing now is that the,
[SPEAKER_04]: like any commodity market, you're seeing
branded product mean much less to the
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer at retail.
[SPEAKER_04]: We manage a portfolio of about 190 retail
doors across Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can observe last year alone over 10
million consumer transactions and we see
[SPEAKER_04]: an extreme willingness to switch.
[SPEAKER_04]: So brand awareness is still coming in our
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have biomass trading both domestically
and internationally below the marginal
[SPEAKER_04]: cost of production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in many ways, the pain that Canada has
experienced is accruing to the benefit of
[SPEAKER_04]: European markets like Germany that are
accessing that biomass and flour at quite
[SPEAKER_04]: reasonable prices in some cases.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was speaking with an operator,
yesterday, who surprisingly told me that
[SPEAKER_04]: they had paid more for a lot of Spanish
origin outdoor grown flour than they had a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of higher quality indoor grown in
Canada, just to put things in perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one of the threads that's
starting to emerge already with our
[SPEAKER_02]: panelists' responses is the importance of
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll definitely, I think you'll see
that as a thread that comes through more
[SPEAKER_02]: and more as we go through the panel
discussions here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving to something totally different,
another part of the world in fact,
[SPEAKER_02]: Kohei.
[SPEAKER_02]: The East and Southeast Asian markets such
as Thailand, Japan, Malaysia are making
[SPEAKER_02]: significant strides with their medical
cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thailand has garnered much attention
recently and has been discussed earlier
[SPEAKER_02]: today in some of these panels as an
emerging market with what we might call
[SPEAKER_02]: tricky and evolving regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there are indeed regulations that could
be tricky and evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you demystify Thailand's cannabis
regulations and markets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical cannabis has been illegal in
Thailand since 2018 and decriminalization
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2022 took things a step further making
it no longer a crime to grow and trade
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and hemp products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently there are more than 5,000
dispensaries all over Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a new government is planning to
ban recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under the new coming regulations,
growers and dispensaries will need to
[SPEAKER_00]: comply with GSCP and transform from
dispensaries into clinics where cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: can only be prescribed by licensed doctors
with care entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody can sell cannabis products to
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect further legislation that will
both safeguard and foster the growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical cannabis industry in Thailand
to deliver the safe and quality cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products to the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent Kohei, thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to come on to the Japanese
market a little bit later which is another
[SPEAKER_02]: very interesting market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just coming to Rob to kind of finish
the first round of questions for the
[SPEAKER_02]: panelists, Rob comes at it from a little
bit of a different outlook of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, what are the biggest challenges
indigenous led cannabis companies have in
[SPEAKER_02]: expanding to international markets and how
can representative organizations like the
[SPEAKER_02]: one you represent support them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, first thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a loaded question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a little context that has
to be provided.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're here as ICIA, the
Indigenous Cannabis Industry Association
[SPEAKER_05]: on behalf of tribes that have signed
resolution of support for our trade
[SPEAKER_05]: association to activate tribes in the
cannabis and hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 574 independent sovereign nations
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: right now and there's indigenous nations
across the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Safety is paramount for our communities,
testing and regulatory bodies.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do all those things within the
jurisdictions of our own governments.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a massive opportunity for
tribes and they're activating.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's approximately a hundred operating
right now in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: First nations we know are operating as
well and there's sovereign markets and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's open markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of complexity to the market
and also a lot of opportunity and for us
[SPEAKER_05]: on the world stage, it's about expressing
that we're open for business, that we are
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for partners.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really advocates as well to elevate
that this plant really is a medicine and
[SPEAKER_05]: we have our own sort of safety crisis
happening by not moving this legislation
[SPEAKER_05]: forward on a world stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great Rob, thanks very much and I
think it's just so intriguing to think
[SPEAKER_02]: about the indigenous groups and their
involvement in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean Canada, it took some time to
develop but it has developed and it is
[SPEAKER_02]: developing quite well now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you think about other countries,
there might not be an indigenous
[SPEAKER_02]: population but you think about other
markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the Rastafari for example in Jamaica
or Barbados where there are religious or
[SPEAKER_02]: cultural reasons why different groups have
access cannabis in different ways and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of historical context to
this as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think in most markets, emerging
markets, you'll have interest groups or
[SPEAKER_02]: other groups that need to be thought about
and navigated, not to mention of course
[SPEAKER_02]: the legacy markets that occur in each of
the jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back across to you Patty, again other side
of the world here for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is the Australian government assisting
Australian cannabis companies broadly
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking but more specifically in
evaluating potential export markets from
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia?
[SPEAKER_01]: The government's been very proactive in
assisting companies in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: A great example is we have a booth here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The MCIA has a booth here at ICBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our third year and we partner with
Global Victoria which is one of our state
[SPEAKER_01]: governments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they fund the booth and everything
that's required for the booth and we bring
[SPEAKER_01]: a delegation every year of Australian
companies so that they can interact with
[SPEAKER_01]: their contemporaries around the world to
build those business pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that the different
departments like we do a lot with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Health but also the
Department of Agriculture because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Department of Agriculture has
actually given us a $250,000 grant for the
[SPEAKER_01]: MCIA to explore export opportunities and
export markets for Australian companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that means is that our scope of
work is to go around and see what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: short, medium and long term prospects for
our medicinal cannabis products in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia to go to markets overseas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we're only a medicinal market,
we can only export to countries that have
[SPEAKER_01]: federally legal medical cannabis markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So none of our product can be diverted to
adult use or rec markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Department of Agriculture has been
very supportive in assisting us to find
[SPEAKER_01]: markets for the Australian manufacturers
of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great insights, Patty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of comes back to the idea of how
plugged in is the government, how
[SPEAKER_02]: supportive is the government in emerging
markets?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there funding allocations allowed,
whether it be research, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_02]: that new companies develop?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Australia, we have a very good tax R&D
incentive for any medical clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: development work that happens in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a 48% tax rebate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for every dollar spent, you get 48
cents back on the dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are many of the pharmaceutical
companies that use Australia for their
[SPEAKER_01]: contract research organizations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great intel, Patty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zach, coming to you, many Canadian
companies are exploring entrance into the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States market.
[SPEAKER_02]: What emerging opportunities are you
looking at in the States?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think they'll face similar
challenges as seen in Canada?
[SPEAKER_02]: And a second part to this question,
just to keep it tricky for you,
[SPEAKER_02]: is SNDL pursuing opportunities in the
United States or additional global
[SPEAKER_02]: markets?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think in our case, we've gone
through such a dramatic transformation in
[SPEAKER_04]: the last three years that people aren't
aware of our current business model.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of Canadian participants,
I think there's the narrative and what's
[SPEAKER_04]: being spoken about versus reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are very few Canadian
participants that have the wherewithal or
[SPEAKER_04]: the capital resources to successfully
enter the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen a number of US brands be
brought up and experience varying levels
[SPEAKER_04]: of success in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: We may one day see the reverse happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always the possibility that a Tim
Hortons or other classic Canadian brand
[SPEAKER_04]: could do well internationally.
[SPEAKER_04]: In our case, we made this decision early
on that as a NASDAQ listed company that's
[SPEAKER_04]: prohibited from engaging in plant touching
activities in the US, that we would gain
[SPEAKER_04]: exposure through credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we deployed over $500 million CAD into
a series of secured credit positions in
[SPEAKER_04]: the US against top MSOs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a few of those, as they've experienced
financial woes, are being restructured and
[SPEAKER_04]: we will end up as either super majority or
100% owners of those businesses down the
[SPEAKER_04]: road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great insight, Zach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kohei, we'll come to you on Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned earlier, Japan is currently
active on the medical cannabis regulatory
[SPEAKER_02]: front.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you provide an update on the law and
future medicinal market in Japan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, David.
[SPEAKER_00]: In December 23, Japan passed a landmark
cannabis reform bill which is expected to
[SPEAKER_00]: be fully implemented by the end of 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new regulations are very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only prescribed medicines like Epidiolex
that have been approved by the Japanese
[SPEAKER_00]: FDA are legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: While smoking, cannabis remains illegal
even for medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this legalization is still a
good opportunity for the Japanese people
[SPEAKER_00]: to know the medical benefit and the
efficacy of cannabis, while most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese people think cannabis is still
just drug, since we have been brainwashed
[SPEAKER_00]: by propaganda after World War II.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this represents a significant
opportunity for biotech companies
[SPEAKER_00]: specializing in the cannabinoid medicine,
particularly those already in phase two or
[SPEAKER_00]: phase three of clinical trials and already
approved by foreign FDAs in the Western
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is crucial because the development of
new medicines from scratch can often take
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 10 to 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This advantage is especially remarkable
considering the Japanese FDA's policy of
[SPEAKER_00]: requiring approval even for drugs that
have already been approved by foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: FDAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introducing cannabinoid medicine that are
already an advantage stage has the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential to speed the introduction and
use of cannabinoid-based medicine to
[SPEAKER_00]: patients in Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This approach can provide quick access to
effective treatments, leveraging this
[SPEAKER_00]: groundwork laid by extensive research and
testing already completed in other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very keen to develop cannabinoid
medicine in partnership with Western
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, particularly often drugs for
epilepsy, Adler syndrome, and Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_00]: disease, which doesn't have effective
treatment so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, Kohei.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that Japanese market's pretty
intriguing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, though, we get the idea that
different markets are going to take
[SPEAKER_02]: different shapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Japanese market will be a
pharmaceutically driven market in a
[SPEAKER_02]: similar vein, let's say to New Zealand or
to UK to a degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be correct?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Japan will be one of the biggest
cannabinoid medicine markets if Japanese
[SPEAKER_00]: people want to take any cannabinoid
substances for medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only option in the pharmaceutical
medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you look at other markets,
and they're more hybrid markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might even call them pre-rec markets
if you wanted to coin a term for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think when you're looking at emerging
markets and deciding as a business where
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to go or how you want to partner
up or where your product mix today and
[SPEAKER_02]: tomorrow may fit, looking at the
orientation of the regulatory scheme in
[SPEAKER_02]: those markets is really, really critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, Japan will be an intriguing
market with a pharmaceutical bent,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, coming across to yourself,
how does tribal sovereignty and autonomy
[SPEAKER_02]: uniquely position indigenous cannabis
businesses in navigating the complex legal
[SPEAKER_02]: landscape of the cannabis industry,
especially concerned in global trade?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just a lot in the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a shit show.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we're all collecting data here,
data points are what we need in Indian
[SPEAKER_05]: country to move policy within our own
reservation boundaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are 574 sovereign nations,
so they're independent, and they have
[SPEAKER_05]: their own ideals.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have their own geographic locations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So kind of starting there and making sure
that the house is in order before you're
[SPEAKER_05]: moving in another direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think on this world stage,
as why we're here, there's traditional
[SPEAKER_05]: plant medicine rights that our communities
have innately since time immemorial.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think as far as what we can bring to
the table on a world stage is that
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective and that sort of lobbying
interest of having indigenous nations at
[SPEAKER_05]: the table advocating for this plant
medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's one opportunity where
the indigenous value is looming large and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's moving rather quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the other aspect of that is
talking to friends in Canada, talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about building capacity for the tribes,
talking about developing not just an
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, but also a workforce for
economic development for sustainable
[SPEAKER_05]: legacy benefits for these communities is
critically important to the indigenous
[SPEAKER_05]: community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's one of the reasons we're here
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: We feel Europe is further ahead than we
are right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: US is sort of sitting in a very static
phase.
[SPEAKER_05]: States are all checking the record board
across the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're also learning, watching,
and gathering as much information as we
[SPEAKER_05]: can and really looking for partners who
can provide an objective view to what the
[SPEAKER_05]: global market looks like compared to the
fodder that we're receiving in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we leave you, maybe say a
couple of words about free trade zones
[SPEAKER_02]: with respect to indigenous groups and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very broad topic, but a couple of
words from you would be great on that
[SPEAKER_02]: subject.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, sovereign nations have the
ability to establish free trade zones for
[SPEAKER_05]: import export with reduced duties and
customs fees.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are all opportunities that tribal
nations have as federally recognized
[SPEAKER_05]: nations.
[SPEAKER_05]: They also have the ability to get DEA
licenses as well for just self-regulating
[SPEAKER_05]: and moving medicine at a higher level.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are all areas and advantages that
tribes have that because of lack of
[SPEAKER_05]: capacity and legal backbone and structure
and fear of repercussion, they've failed
[SPEAKER_05]: to move in these directions aggressively,
but they are getting more bold now as
[SPEAKER_05]: they've gotten organized and started to
pool resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a really important subject
and you educated me on it before the panel
[SPEAKER_02]: and I did some extra reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very intriguing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A question to Patty across to yourself
here, and maybe this is a good one for
[SPEAKER_02]: folks in the audience who are looking to
kind of choose markets and plan their next
[SPEAKER_02]: strategic moves.
[SPEAKER_02]: What markets, in your view, Patty,
hold the greatest potential for Australian
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis companies besides their home
market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, since we can only export to
federally legal pharmaceutical markets,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're kind of limited as to where we can
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the things that we look for when we're
exploring potential export markets is what
[SPEAKER_01]: is the regulatory pathway?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there is some sort of beachhead or
some sort of collaboration that the MCIA
[SPEAKER_01]: can spearhead on behalf of the companies
for a product registration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look at what the regulatory pathways
are, obviously the size of the country,
[SPEAKER_01]: what their framework is, and what the
logistical expertise and regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: expertise are required in order to get
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the markets, we export quite a bit
to Germany from Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We send some to the UK and we're also,
I think Poland is another market that some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Australian companies will really
look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great insights, Patty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, the importance of that
understanding the regulatory environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: the orientation of the regs pharmaceutical
or potentially not quite so heavy that
[SPEAKER_02]: direction is so key to choosing these
markets, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the other markets
that's going to be really interesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think Paul from Little Green Pharma,
a fellow Aussie who spoke earlier today,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the French market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they're doing their trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I believe their trial's wrapped
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to figure out what sort of
framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll do it the French way, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, watching that market and seeing
how for their trial, obviously they had to
[SPEAKER_01]: import product because they're not making
any logistical locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be an export from
Australia import into France pathway
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to be established by that
trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, Patty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's move across to Zach for a quick
question on kind of what advice that you
[SPEAKER_02]: would give to new cannabis companies
looking to gain market share, global
[SPEAKER_02]: market share.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a broad and complex question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for giving me that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as Patty had referenced, I think
understanding the regulatory framework in
[SPEAKER_04]: each given market is really critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be as much as 70% or more of the
battle at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we've seen in Canada,
there was certainly a very high level of
[SPEAKER_04]: exuberance as we went into a rec legal or
adult use marketplace just over five years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: It drew in entrepreneurs, of all ilks,
some with longstanding business and
[SPEAKER_04]: professional backgrounds, some who were
willing to risk everything that they had
[SPEAKER_04]: saved to get into that market.
[SPEAKER_04]: While many would regard this plant as
somewhat magic, this industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: these businesses do submit to the laws of
gravity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Understanding the entire supply chain in
the markets in which you either are
[SPEAKER_04]: operating or looking to operate is
critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Understanding where the economics fall,
where bottlenecks are, where risk really
[SPEAKER_04]: lies, I think is critical to success.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also not trying to be all things to
all people.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we recognized in Canada was if the
adult use market was designed in such a
[SPEAKER_04]: manner that the only point of contact
effectively between the consumer and THC
[SPEAKER_04]: products was going to be at retail,
that if you wanted to own the consumer
[SPEAKER_04]: relationship, having a very strong
presence downstream in retail was going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we moved aggressively in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great insight, Zach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, so helpful to get insights from
individuals and companies that have
[SPEAKER_02]: navigated some of these choppy waters and
can bring us a bit of help as we look at
[SPEAKER_02]: emerging markets and how to decipher
choosing directions, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kohei, a question across to yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a couple more questions here,
then we'll go out for audience questions
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long do you think it will be before we
see this kind of long-awaited
[SPEAKER_02]: stabilization on the regulatory front in
Thailand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think some people are saying
that the cannabis plant will go back to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a narcotic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it might not happen,
and everybody hopes so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this new regulation, when it will be
installed, I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pew, you know that?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a Thai grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the best growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's waiting for that golden nugget,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the best genetic supplier in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jordan, you know that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great, Kohei.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One final question, Rob, to yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have a little bit of time for
questions, because we were nipped for
[SPEAKER_02]: about five minutes by the previous friends
on the previous panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the evolving legal landscape and
increasing market opportunities,
[SPEAKER_02]: what future directions do you envision for
the indigenous cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: both domestically and internationally?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to become friends with Zach and
figure out how to, you know, be pragmatic
[SPEAKER_05]: about what launches look like,
but also figure out ways to access
[SPEAKER_05]: capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's some things that are built
into Indian country that just don't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we were given gaming.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: and able to regulate that through IGA,
but we're also told that we can't use any
[SPEAKER_05]: of those profits towards cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's ways to get around that,
but I think it really is about problem
[SPEAKER_05]: solving.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I talk about, you know,
capacity building and tribal governments,
[SPEAKER_05]: our tribal governments are in charge of
every facet of government, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that includes business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So creating an academic development
committee to create a business development
[SPEAKER_05]: committee to move towards a cannabis
operation while they're making sure their
[SPEAKER_05]: housing and health care and legal is all
taken care of.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a lot for a tribe to manage.
[SPEAKER_05]: So trusted partners are something that we
have been trying to vet since our
[SPEAKER_05]: organization's been around for three years
because there have been a lot of bad
[SPEAKER_05]: actors out in Indian country doing bad
things for years and years and years,
[SPEAKER_05]: just around cannabis, not talking about
other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But specifically for this, we are
positioned with 70 percent of the existing
[SPEAKER_05]: land base left in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have sovereignty.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have self-determination.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can self-regulate.
[SPEAKER_05]: As an independent nation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, in my opinion, that's a massive
advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, Rob, and I'm not going to argue
with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we've got a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The questions we'll hand across.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it for the panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's got a question?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone got a question?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Bo has a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bo always has good questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Bo Woodley, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here I go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm on my way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, this is very interesting,
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks for your contributions to this
conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the United States and elsewhere,
medical cannabis is usually viewed as a
[SPEAKER_03]: springboard into adult use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for those like in Australia or
Japan, you've got medical now,
[SPEAKER_03]: limited medical in Japan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that in the future that will
serve as a springboard to full adult use
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization?
[SPEAKER_03]: Patty Cohey, would you like to have a go
at that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll have a crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Bo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when we're talking about medicinal
cannabis, as we all know, there's so many,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's such a wide array of indications
that it can be used for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also the different formats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think anything that's in a more
pharmaceutical format, such as the
[SPEAKER_01]: software soft gels, or the tinctures,
or even the pastilles, the gummies,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that will lead, that will
segue from medicinal into adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're currently seeing in Australia,
due to a number of factors, the falling
[SPEAKER_01]: price to consumer, the ease of actually
getting a prescription now, because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's more doctors that are willing to
prescribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some patients, there are people
who are using illicit product who are now
[SPEAKER_01]: switching to illicit product because
access is easier and the quality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: product is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think of medicinal use versus
recreational use, I think about the intent
[SPEAKER_01]: behind the use of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look at someone who's buying illicit
product to help them go to sleep at night
[SPEAKER_01]: or help quell their anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not about the type of product
they're taking, it's about their intention
[SPEAKER_01]: to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think if we bear in mind that people
use cannabis and medicinal cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: different purposes, I don't think in
Australia, we're gonna have a great shift
[SPEAKER_01]: towards adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, it's at least five,
possibly 10 years away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other thoughts from panelists on the
question?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, fantastic, let's hear it once
again for our panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Way to come in and get her done.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the International Cannabis
Business Conference.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Berlin, day two, shout out to the Tom
and Groove.
