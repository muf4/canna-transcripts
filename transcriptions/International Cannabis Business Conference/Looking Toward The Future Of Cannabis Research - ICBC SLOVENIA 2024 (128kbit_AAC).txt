[SPEAKER_04]: All right, coming up for our next panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I left my program in the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking toward the future of cannabis
research, here to lead this discussion is
[SPEAKER_04]: the Chief Operating Officer of the Tellman
Group and a good friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_04]: and he's here for us right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it for Justin Tambi.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's everybody doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're excited to be here and talk a
little bit with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: about research in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me introduce the two co-panelists
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rui Soros, do you want to come on up?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, Bojo or Bojeda, we're happy to
have you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forgive me for brutalizing names.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of mics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grab yourselves a seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you guys give a warm round of
applause and a welcome to our panelists
[SPEAKER_02]: here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do it in order.
[SPEAKER_02]: That works.
[SPEAKER_03]: That works.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we are in an interesting period of
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you've been hearing throughout
the day some of the things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: evolving and changing in the regulatory
framework with regards to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: and one of our sort of guiding principles
here with the Tellman Group, located here
[SPEAKER_02]: in Slovenia, is that the research in the
world of cannabis has been sort of limited
[SPEAKER_02]: and biased by the legacy of our
prohibition and our regulatory approach,
[SPEAKER_02]: and now as we move into a more modern and
an open-minded approach to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: we hope to see a opening and a broadening
of the approach to research in cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and also an increase in investment in
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that there should be some
new things that are possible that haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: been before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first, you know, it's an optimistic
view.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an idealistic view.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to first just ask the panelists,
in your experience, do these changes in
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations mean that there will be new
opportunities in cannabis research,
[SPEAKER_02]: or how would you like to see these
potential changes in regulation affect
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can talk for Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, we don't have yet the new
regulation, but I hope, as the government
[SPEAKER_03]: promised, we will have it soon,
and I think it will be also easier to
[SPEAKER_03]: research the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis is actually very much a
research plant, most research plant on the
[SPEAKER_03]: planet, but still we are failing on the
pre-clinical clinical trials and real life
[SPEAKER_03]: data, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have high, I don't know, science and
all that, but on the field of medicine,
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing changed, actually, in the last few
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned that the cannabis plant
is one of the most studied plants in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world, and yet you say that the real
relevancy and applicability of that data
[SPEAKER_02]: and the science doesn't really impact
medicine and its practical use.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would have to change in order for
that to happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: First, we have to change narrative about
cannabis as a whole, because until when
[SPEAKER_03]: the mainstream professionals or medicines
is a priori against the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: you cannot do really changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then another big thing is how to convince
the industry to support cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know the pharma industry is supporting
clinical trials all over the world because
[SPEAKER_03]: they have their own benefits, but in the
area of cannabis research, you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: really get any funds, not the state funds,
not in Slovenia and mostly Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this should change as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Rui, what about you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You wanna tell us what your experience is
and how the regulatory framework is or
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't encouraging research and what kind
of changes you'd like to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, in terms of, it depends from country
to country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know better the situation in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Portugal was first country in Europe to
legalize the production of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: processing of cannabis for medical
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This law came in July 2018, but it was,
of course, a slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, it came as a surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people didn't believe it that it
would be approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, of course, there were two or three
companies already ready to start,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them Tilray, big multinational,
but then local companies, a few reacted
[SPEAKER_00]: fast to start producing, but it was just,
they were just growers, no real research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also say that in Portugal, science
means European money.
[SPEAKER_00]: No European money, no science,
private or public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so 2018, this was at the end of
framework at the Horizon 2020,
[SPEAKER_00]: so money for research was ending.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new framework, Horizon 2030,
was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is always here a dead period
between the end of one framework and
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make it worse, so in beginning of
the Horizon 2030, framework, it came
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic, and everything stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with pandemic, everyone start talking
about the recovery and resilience plan
[SPEAKER_00]: that somehow made the investments in the
framework of Horizon 2030 to delay,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning that first the resilience and
recovery money came, that despite this was
[SPEAKER_00]: decided in 2020, only in 2023 start
arriving to the European countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still going now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is that the 2030 Horizon
money programs, it started now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we see it happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are lots of grant submissions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't say to my surprise
immediately, but thinking better,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it was happening now because these
monies, there were no grants for research
[SPEAKER_00]: for many years since 2018, 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that there are these grant
submissions in Portugal, I see that
[SPEAKER_00]: several companies are investing in
research, goes from technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: can go to growth technology, production,
processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But several growers and processing
companies are actually submitting grants
[SPEAKER_00]: to do preclinical studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: These processes never go widely,
massively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies, they are to the lead,
they are beginning, they are pioneers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as these companies are putting these
new projects with preclinical tests,
[SPEAKER_00]: so private sector, working with medicine
schools, with pharmacy schools,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will bring more in future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it start happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Portugal in Germany now also.
[SPEAKER_00]: With legalization and Germany,
things, I think, will go much,
[SPEAKER_00]: much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also with Horizon 2030 there, we will see
definitely preclinical studies going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clinical studies, it's another division.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not talking about investing a few
hundreds of thousands or even one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's big, big investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it will be required or governmental,
really governmental programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the big pharma industry to come
seriously into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be big developments in years to
come.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to add, Justin, you asked
which kind of legislation I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to have legislation which would not
limit research and so the science can be
[SPEAKER_03]: real science and not as many, too many
times today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a politically correct science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then legislation should follow the
real science, otherwise we will not,
[SPEAKER_03]: otherwise we are in catch-22 for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.
Understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apologize because I realize I didn't give
you guys an opportunity here to let the
[SPEAKER_02]: crowd know and the people here know what
you actually specialize in and work in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as a moderator, I'm sorry I didn't
give you a chance to introduce yourselves
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a big family here at the events
that we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we get very comfortable and
familiar with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why don't you just real quickly for a
minute let folks know what your work is in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and where that might influence
your view on research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our main work actually is for last 10
years to follow cannabis products which
[SPEAKER_03]: are used by patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: From any market, black, gray, or regular
market because this is the only way that
[SPEAKER_03]: you have really good insight into what is
good, what is not good, what helps and
[SPEAKER_03]: what not helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope all this research, as I said,
will be legal very soon because the real
[SPEAKER_03]: research should not be limited by
bureaucratic obstacles which is actually
[SPEAKER_03]: the biggest problem anywhere among funds,
of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you, Oe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so complicated to define my company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in business for 42 years and we
started by being distributors of
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were founded by PhD students from
chemical engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since beginning that we were also
doing, it was development of turnkey
[SPEAKER_00]: systems for people doing research,
usually chemistry departments,
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry departments, biotechnology
departments, pharmacy schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always been also kind of not
manufacturers because we always developed
[SPEAKER_00]: prototypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somehow extraction became always
something that we were looking a lot for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with legalization in cannabis in 2018,
companies were working on this area and
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted extraction equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were different, so they start calling
us to supply equipment for extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we entered in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are in cannabis by the technology,
not by the science of the therapeutics of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going there slowly, but we enter by
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how we enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we expanded to post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of research and development,
we kept on just expanding our knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and our technologies on all downstream
processes of extraction and also more
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were initially just CO2, supercritical
for the extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time we start having ethanol,
solventless, and now also other carbons
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction and all downstreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, because we are an ISO
9001 certified company, and recently in
[SPEAKER_00]: meantime we got UGMP certified lab,
and even more recently, it was this last
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter, we got a license to do research
in cannabis because we were selling and
[SPEAKER_00]: developing equipment, but we could not
test equipment in house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to go to the customers because we
could not have cannabis, not even hemp in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is more forbidden than cannabis
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp in Portugal is fiber and seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers is a residue to be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, we got the license for R&D,
meaning we can have cannabis in house and
[SPEAKER_00]: we can test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this immediately, we increase the
number of technologies that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this new framework I mentioned,
between our own projects and together with
[SPEAKER_00]: universities and cannabis companies,
we submitted for grants and with grants or
[SPEAKER_00]: without grants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going forward with the research
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's expanding, so it's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In meantime, we are also getting
certification in management of innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are going, developing very seriously
this R&D, R&D department in our company,
[SPEAKER_00]: in which 80% of work is cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_03]: And may I add, I forgot to say that our
institute is also co-organizing seminars
[SPEAKER_03]: and education courses on the faculty of
health sciences about cannabis because if
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't start to teach, you know,
new students about cannabis yesterday,
[SPEAKER_03]: not tomorrow, we will not have
professionals for 10 years, then we help
[SPEAKER_03]: also or help some startup companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with this cooperation, we also joined
the space exploration.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were sending some samples to the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you have to follow somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are active on many, many fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis in space.
[SPEAKER_02]: That certainly sounds like something new
in the field of research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a theme here, though,
that we could reiterate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned, again, you know,
cannabis being the most studied plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet we hear how people involved in the
industry as a matter of practice are
[SPEAKER_02]: unable to conduct the research most
relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't even bring in, you know,
biomass material from cannabis to figure
[SPEAKER_02]: out how to extract it within your
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a difficulty sometimes being able
to obtain material to use in the practice
[SPEAKER_02]: of medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so though it has been really studied,
it has been really researched,
[SPEAKER_02]: it hasn't been done in the context of
what's most relevant and important.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we look as a cannabis industry to move
forward, I think that's got to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: emphasis in our communication from the
industry to the regulators about what
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you point out, maybe we'll start
with you, one piece of something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of new and or exciting to you,
a piece of research, or a development of a
[SPEAKER_02]: new technology in your part of the field
of cannabis in either extraction or
[SPEAKER_02]: post-processing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I speak about two?
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as we have time.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have two fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's post-harvest and it's extraction and
modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a quite hot topic because by a
burden reduction, it's a very serious
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a serious problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak about lots of growers and say,
oh, we do not have contaminations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had the contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has contaminations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is not the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to count.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are very well-defined limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to be analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter if it is GACP or if it
is GMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The limits are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have a crop that is
contaminated, what to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: People are using typically radiation by
ionizing radiation, gamma radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: electron beam, or x-rays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this always affects quality of the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loss of terpenes, potential loss of
cannabinoids, and flower oxidizes get
[SPEAKER_00]: brownish.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is less of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even worse in terms of market,
commercial aspects in Germany nowadays,
[SPEAKER_00]: flower that is irradiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is subject to ionizing radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be marked as irradiated product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people don't want to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the other technologies,
even without having to put on label like
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal processes by radio frequency or
microwaves or plasma or ozone,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these oxidize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And flower is affected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a brand new technology,
American technology, using
[SPEAKER_00]: cryopasteurization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically,
 they freeze instantly to very,
very low temperatures, cryogenic
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We leak nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these, microbes, molds, bacteria is
killed instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flower doesn't suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps all the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps all the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even all these pathogens that are
eliminated, that are killed, because this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a process in which there is a flow of
nitrogen always passing, all this lets say
[SPEAKER_00]: corpuses of these dead pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very thin particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are swept away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when packaged, this material will not
give that smelly taste or moldy flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a very high quality product,
even starting with highly contaminated
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a huge advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I follow these bioburden research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bioburden reduction technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is absolutely the very,
very big step.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is next generation bioburden
reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of extraction, especially
thinking medical cannabis, we go to German
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say the recommended technology is CO2
extraction, meaning supercritical food
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at high pressures and temperatures
above ambient, like 35, 40, 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a must, but is a recommended
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree, that gives you the best
extracts, at least in terms of purity and
[SPEAKER_00]: in a controlled way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are traditionally using dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look for other techniques,
more in recreational, like hydrocarbons
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction, that use fresh, frozen
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these extracts can reach in terpenes,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because fresh flower is far more terpenes
than the dried flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there are problems of
contaminations, residual solvents,
[SPEAKER_00]: like propane and butane on the extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take them out, the terpenes go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Europe, it comes with relational
limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no measurable residual solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this doesn't go well with high terpene
content, if you have to put under vacant
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of time, two degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are new developments in CO2
extraction, not in supercritical,
[SPEAKER_00]: but using cryogenic temperatures again,
but not so cryogenic, like zero to minus
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, minus 30 degrees centigrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have liquid CO2 with small amounts
of co-solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allow you to extract not from dry
flowers, but also from fresh flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen fresh flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you get the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a very high period extract,
very potent extract, coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potency is typically of 80%, even if you
are extracting from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a huge, huge terpene potency
concentration, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in both instances, you're looking to
get cold with, excuse me, to have these
[SPEAKER_02]: new advances.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bozo, do you have something that you'd
like to speak to about in the field of
[SPEAKER_02]: medical application that's a new area of
research, or do you want to tell us why
[SPEAKER_02]: you're sending samples to space?
[SPEAKER_02]: Something?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, maybe about space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Space exploration, last years,
it's quite interesting story from China to
[SPEAKER_03]: USA and India.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cannabis is one of the plants
which can withstand high dose of light
[SPEAKER_03]: radiation, very high, and let's see what
damage can do or will do the cosmic
[SPEAKER_03]: radiation on the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we also send some other cannabis
products to space, and we want to test
[SPEAKER_03]: then what is the difference, if any,
when those products come back from the
[SPEAKER_03]: space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't expect anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will just follow the science or let's
see what will happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe next year, in the next two
years, we will be able to tell you more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any conversation about people
being able to use cannabis in space?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet, but you never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it would be very good for the
astronauts because of all the symptoms
[SPEAKER_03]: they can get, like anxiety or depression
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very good idea, Justin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but it might be a little while
before we see any pictures of anybody with
[SPEAKER_01]: a joint in the space station.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not joint necessarily, you have other
administration routes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extracts, extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed, indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Gaio, how are we doing on time?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got about three minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then questions after?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well then, let's take a moment to sum
things up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really quickly, because the field of
research in cannabis is actually so big
[SPEAKER_02]: that we could, in this moment,
just talk about a couple of small aspects
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we're looking at the way that
these regulatory changes can encourage or
[SPEAKER_02]: limit research.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you look at the plant itself,
cannabis produces, at this last count,
[SPEAKER_02]: something close to 140 phytocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has well over 100 terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole number of flavonoids that
is approaching that, as well as amines and
[SPEAKER_02]: amides and a whole bunch of other phyto
compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over 500 in total that this one plant
produces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now those interact with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those interact with each of yours
endocannabinoid system in really unique
[SPEAKER_02]: ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times when research is done,
it starts with the supposition,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, if we give cannabis to this person,
is it effective for this?
[SPEAKER_02]: But in fact, I've just mentioned that
there's 500 different variables you have
[SPEAKER_02]: to look at and potentially control for to
understand this genotype, this chemovar,
[SPEAKER_02]: and all of the interactions with a
person's unique conditions that have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: looked at and accounted for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not even talking about the
agronomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of how you grow and cultivate the plant,
the extraction or post-processing,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the many industrial applications,
far beyond just medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the field of cannabis science is
actually really vast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And though it seems like we've studied a
lot, you've heard from folks here in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, a lot of that research hasn't
been directed into how we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: really utilize this plant to get all the
benefits out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's new in cannabis research will
actually be a lot more research.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's needed, investment in it
from a public and a private sector,
[SPEAKER_02]: and also investment in an open-minded
approach that just doesn't look at things
[SPEAKER_02]: in really simple terms, black and white,
cannabis good or bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so hopefully that's the evolution in
the industry that we'll be taking forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate your guys' time and attention
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Ngyao's going to take us away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you please give our panelists another
round of applause and thank them for their
[SPEAKER_02]: time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have questions, I'm sure you
can ask them.
