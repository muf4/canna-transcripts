We started in just a couple minutes,
so get in and take a seat y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the International Canada Business
Conference, and many people who came here
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of took a chance, bought a ticket,
wasn't sure what to expect, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the feedback I'm getting is,
I can't believe this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know it was going to be this
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they mean by good is information and
networking and just the general attitude
[SPEAKER_03]: of the people here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe in karma, I believe in
community, I believe in love and
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding, and I actually believe if
you hold true to some of those tenets and
[SPEAKER_03]: precepts, that you're only going to
benefit yourself for so many reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in my case, it's actually helped me
make money also.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's this new win-win situation that's
happening with the cannabis industry in
[SPEAKER_03]: particular, and I think that's what people
are very surprised about, that they can
[SPEAKER_03]: make money, they can be successful,
and no one else has to lose.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just wrapped it up here at the
International Cannabis Business
[SPEAKER_02]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a fantastic time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve Blum from Celeb Stoner and Freedom
Leaf Magazine was here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve DeAngelo was here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethan Nadelman from the Drug Policy
Alliance gave an impassioned, impassioned
[SPEAKER_02]: speech about what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are actually overly excited and
happy that we have decided to dedicate so
[SPEAKER_03]: much of this to culture, politics,
and advocacy, and I'm tremendously happy
[SPEAKER_03]: with the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never doubt a small group of concerned
citizens can change the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is indeed the only thing that ever has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being a part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
