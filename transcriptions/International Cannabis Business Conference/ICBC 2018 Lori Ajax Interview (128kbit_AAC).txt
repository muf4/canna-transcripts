[SPEAKER_01]: And in the first 30 days of commercial
legalization here in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say from the front row as a press
person that her agency is the one that is
[SPEAKER_01]: the most on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ladies and gentlemen, I hope you'll
please make my guests welcome Lori Ajax
[SPEAKER_01]: and Alex Traverso from the Bureau of
Campus Control.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the annual license, it's a lot more
expensive than the temporary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is getting fingerprinted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's providing all your financial
exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: More for all the owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have to give us more
detailed information on their background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is going to be more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the whole point of doing the
temporary licenses is that those
[SPEAKER_00]: temporaries are built for 120 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have that four months to fill
out your annual application and submit.
