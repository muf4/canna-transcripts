[SPEAKER_03]: So hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back to, I guess, cannabis
technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that a lot of you are very,
very interested in these issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think today we're gonna be discussing
the many, many ways that technology
[SPEAKER_03]: generally is gonna be, if not has already
begun to revolutionize our business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So canatech is a very, very broad term,
but what I'd like to do is start with some
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of to give you an understanding of
how broad this is and how many aspects of
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis industry technology affects,
starting with legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: But beyond that, we have some very,
very interesting panelists today with a
[SPEAKER_03]: wide range of technology that's being
deployed right now, and the impact on our
[SPEAKER_03]: industry is going to be really,
really huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna start with a question that
I'd like everybody to answer in a very
[SPEAKER_03]: short soundbite kind of way.
[SPEAKER_03]: What and where do you see technology
playing a role in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: and maybe everybody can give a very brief
introduction of what they do and how
[SPEAKER_03]: that's important as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked what Lisa just said, said
something about us all needing to work
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are integrating things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are integrating technologies,
and you talk about the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is the perfect place to say
that we can all drive this forward both on
[SPEAKER_01]: the product as well as the technologies
used to actually grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a very interesting topic,
and I'm very happy that she brought that
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in this unique place that we can all
work together, and I love the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technology itself can help us create new
products new chemicals, new plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Mark, can you tell them what,
you're in grow tech, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that mean exactly?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we grow, we create facilities to grow
cannabis and food and vegetables,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we think about sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want, as my mission, I belong to the 60
plus that the previous speaker talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make the world a better place
for my children and all of your children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sustainability is one of those
possibilities that we want to push in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to have a more sustainable world,
and that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I'm going to actually bounce over
here to Lucas because he's also in grow
[SPEAKER_03]: tech, although from the American
perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you see technology playing a role
in grow tech, and how does that use,
[SPEAKER_03]: and why is that cool?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I think it's a very broad
question, but it is something that is very
[SPEAKER_06]: important to the industry moving forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think a lot of times what we look at
is new technology, and it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: necessarily that we always need to focus
on the new technology on the cultivation
[SPEAKER_06]: side of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also addressing new ways to address
old challenges, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think in the cannabis industry,
we have a lot of what we referred to
[SPEAKER_06]: earlier as the black market.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to consider it as the legacy
growers, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is understanding where they came from,
this plant, and really how we learn from
[SPEAKER_06]: that and build it into a commercial
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why we're trying to optimize
scale so that we can have a consistent
[SPEAKER_06]: quality product going forward for both the
medical and for the adult use markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Ziye, you're also coming to this in a
very different role with some very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very new technology used in new ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: But generally, what do you think
technology is going to mean to the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry from your perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we are coming also from software
development, and we're developing
[SPEAKER_00]: different technologies in fintech and
healthcare technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that the industry is in need of
new technologies from the software
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why there is a huge perspective
just to move forward and to develop new
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies in the software.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of done, but much more can
be done in cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, you're using a technology,
artificial intelligence, and you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: the only one up here that's going to be
using AI.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can anybody else talk about why AI
specifically is going to be very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very useful to this industry in several
different ways?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe starting with sales,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, just short, Hello Mary is a
traditional e-commerce platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did, we added, we developed AI
based voice assistant, which brings the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of the customer journey in different
level, whether you don't have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all information, which is in the verb
or in the, let's say data, they will be
[SPEAKER_00]: given to customers or to doctors or to
just the person who is looking information
[SPEAKER_00]: very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we see the technologies to
bring new technologies to the industry to
[SPEAKER_00]: help and contribute.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what about you, Tobias?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're coming this from something a little
bit different, nanotech, which is really
[SPEAKER_03]: out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does canatech mean to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nanotech sounds extremely fancy,
many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: To come back to the start, technology is
always an answer for a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And three years ago, we defined a problem,
our visionary founder, Mr. Torge Diebus,
[SPEAKER_02]: defined a problem, and that is the low
bioavailability of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was an answer in the science and
scientific literature, drug delivery
[SPEAKER_02]: systems, predominantly used in the
pharmaceutical field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we adopted this technology to make a
carrier system that helps your body absorb
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids faster to a higher extent and
with longer lasting effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing, we combine our carrier
systems with synergistic combinations of
[SPEAKER_02]: active ingredients to get specific effects
with high bioavailability cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think you can see that everybody up
here is using technology in different ways
[SPEAKER_03]: to make their jobs easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: As my late uncle Peter Drucker used to
say, technology is great, but it's just a
[SPEAKER_03]: tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it doesn't achieve your ends,
then don't use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's do a little bit more of a deep
dive into some of the specifics.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'd like to focus on is what exactly
is grotech?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it about the breeding of the plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it about the building?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it about the tracking tech?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it about automation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it about sustainability?
[SPEAKER_03]: The two grotech guys, how does that work?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there's really two silos that
that really fits in.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first is going to be in automation,
as you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really in terms of driving down
the cost production, producing a very
[SPEAKER_06]: consistent, clean, quality product by
leveraging that automation on the front
[SPEAKER_06]: end of the cultivation side of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other silo is really going to be on
the technical side in terms of data.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how are we actually growing these
plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the climates that it's thriving
in?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what are the climates that are
creating stress and informs for pest,
[SPEAKER_06]: disease, pathogens, things like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it really comes down to how we
gather that data, how we translate that
[SPEAKER_06]: into information, and then use that into
insight for our growing needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, this is great because
we've got an American grotech and a German
[SPEAKER_03]: grotech.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to also then throw this out
to Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you see this kind of technology
aiding in the assistance of, say,
[SPEAKER_03]: meeting high compliance standards like
EUGMP or GACP or sustainability,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_01]: The wonderful thing about technology is
that you can combine what nature gives
[SPEAKER_01]: you, for example, the sun, with the
technology to control the environment to
[SPEAKER_01]: make plants happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end, we all want happy plants
because they give us the best product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the question is, how do we make the
best combination?
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, we can use AI to control the
climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: To pick the right cultivars to grow the
best plants in the shortest amount of time
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the most amount of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a business conference here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're trying to do the best we can
with the technologies that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're developing and pushing
these technologies that don't only apply
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will also spill over, which is really
exciting, partly in the food industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: food production, as well as into climate
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Et cetera, for housing, for example,
and skyscrapers and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this industry is driving a lot of parts
into our society.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is exciting that we have the
opportunity to be part of this forefront
[SPEAKER_01]: of a new technology that is emerging.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think there's a theme here,
which is that technology is being
[SPEAKER_03]: combined.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to throw this back to Zia,
who, hello, Mary, actually uses AI to
[SPEAKER_03]: create a customer journey that is really
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, in general, AI is like the
future of sales in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: But why is it so important to use
something like, say, medically trained AI
[SPEAKER_03]: and cannabis in a sales application?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as I mentioned, we are our team
coming from health care, digital health
[SPEAKER_00]: care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we see their perspective of
using, as we discussed before,
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, using AI or new technologies in
cannabis will give us much knowledge to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop current market, to develop new
instruments for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, medical cannabis is a next kind
of, there will be a fusion of the digital
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the products we are
developing as well, where we'll have the
[SPEAKER_00]: data will be used explicitly for that
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're working also with one software
developing with one software where we will
[SPEAKER_00]: get medical data from variable devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of our product development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that information will give customer,
will be kind of a breach in the
[SPEAKER_00]: telemedicine between a patient and a
doctor, if the doctors want to see how the
[SPEAKER_00]: specific cannabis or dose or strain
affects the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I believe, it's the new future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also working on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to flip back over to Tobias.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell us, in layman's terms,
what exactly nanotechnology is?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm relatively sure I can try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, if you're in a certain size
range, below 500 nanometers, depending on
[SPEAKER_02]: the definition, then people speak about
nanoparticles, nanomaterials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if your size is that low, then some
physical parameters change, giving
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting opportunities for new
technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you using this with what,
bioavailability?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you give us a sense of what you're
using nanotechnology for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I try my very best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with the term bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_02]: It describes the fraction of active
substance that you take in that is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually absorbed by your body,
in contrast to the amount of substance
[SPEAKER_02]: that you take in and that is metabolized
and released without being used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for CBD, the official WHO number is
6%, meaning more than 90% of the CBD you
[SPEAKER_02]: take in simply goes to waste, is not used
by your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where we come in with our
technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We help your body with absorbing
cannabinoids and other active ingredients
[SPEAKER_02]: by transporting them in nanoscale lipid
carrier systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, what does that mean in English?
[SPEAKER_02]: Milk is an emulsion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two immiscible liquids, homogeneously
dispersed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have an oil droplet and you make
it really, really, really small,
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fill those oil droplets with
cannabinoids and stabilize it within
[SPEAKER_02]: so-called emulsifier.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's like mayonnaise, basically,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those small particles, they give the
active ingredient a huge surface between
[SPEAKER_02]: oil and water and they help these active
substances to transfer into the aqueous
[SPEAKER_02]: phase, for example, in your saliva or into
your gastrointestinal tract and provide a
[SPEAKER_02]: huge surface for absorption by mucosal
membrane.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes everything more efficient,
basically, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can sum it up with that word,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next thing that I'd like to get to
is the idea of technology in personalized
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I think everybody up here is
involved in in some way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were actually talking about this in
the green room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when it gets to that point,
obviously, you'd be able to have a system
[SPEAKER_03]: where you can find the best medication
that you need and maybe back that into a
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, which is growing, you know,
a greenhouse or an indoor grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is growing for people who need that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's put into some sort of,
you know, high absorption nanotechnology.
[SPEAKER_03]: But where do you see personalized
medicine, cannabis and technology crossing
[SPEAKER_03]: and how?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good question, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's exactly where we say I can
play a big role to to find personalization
[SPEAKER_00]: of and finding a product that the customer
patients are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just observe how high tech is
developing in not only in software,
[SPEAKER_00]: also in the hardware in cannabis,
hardware.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we were discussing a few days
about this high tech vaporizers just to
[SPEAKER_00]: see to find a personal dosage or personal
use, how they can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I believe not only software,
but also hardware will be play will be
[SPEAKER_00]: playing an important role because other
industries, they're already using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just have to get more attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe with the legalizations will
be more attention to bring available on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market technologies to the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucas, you're coming from the American
market, which is very, very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see a time when, say, in Colorado,
there's going to be a green, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a section of greenhouses that can grow
your own personalized medicine?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that feasible, viable?
[SPEAKER_03]: How far away is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, you know, what it really comes
down to is driving two things is the is
[SPEAKER_06]: the genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the cannabinoid profile that comes
from this plant and specific genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the consistency and the cultivation
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: As we refine our practices downstream of
harvesting, we need to ensure that the
[SPEAKER_06]: product that we're producing before that
harvest is is consistent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a consistent basis that we're
building for this post harvest processing
[SPEAKER_06]: as it gets more complex.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we are going to, which I absolutely
believe, enter more of a medicinal market
[SPEAKER_06]: that's specific to each patient and we can
hone in on those different aspects of
[SPEAKER_06]: different genetics and different
cannabinoids, the cultivation absolutely
[SPEAKER_06]: needs to be dialed in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where we really need to
leverage that technology, that automation
[SPEAKER_06]: and those systems to really refine that
environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then build this build this genetic
code within the plant as we cultivate it
[SPEAKER_06]: all the way through harvest so that
everyone on the back end can can use that
[SPEAKER_06]: precision to to really refine it to each
patient's needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from from Colorado to Germany,
can you see personalized medicine within
[SPEAKER_03]: an EU GMP framework?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do you think that that might work
and be aided by technology?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're happy that GMP and GACP is
going to be pushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's helps us all to create better
plants, healthier plants and have a
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the possibility using AI to
actually looking at the chemicals and how
[SPEAKER_01]: to infect these chemicals by changing the
climate, just like Lucas has said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beautiful thing is for me as a
chemical engineer, like the old saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you give a kid a hammer and everything
looks like a nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you are a chemical engineer,
you look at the plant, not as a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily, but a chemical factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which changes can I make to the
environment to create the changes in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that I would love to see?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need people like Tobias to tell us how
to what they need and how to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: deliver those chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it's an exciting prospect to
change things still holistically,
[SPEAKER_01]: not talking about isolating one specific
chemical, but having still a plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: creates a holistic medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that scale, you have to use
massive amount of data to actually create
[SPEAKER_01]: what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that takes technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Tobias, I want to sort of get into some
of this because I think that nano is
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely on the front end of
personalized medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk a little bit about not just
the nanotechnology, but things like
[SPEAKER_03]: patches and the things that you're doing
to bring cannabis as personalized medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: into a medical stream that can be used?
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about a vision, yes, many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is important for personalized
medicine I would say is that you control
[SPEAKER_02]: which substances you give a person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is quite clear, but how much is
applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at the body as an
individual system, it is hard to control
[SPEAKER_02]: how much of a substance is really
absorbed, taken in, and there comes
[SPEAKER_02]: nanotechnology in play.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially what you mentioned,
patches.
[SPEAKER_02]: With patches, you can control how much
substance is applied to a person.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the right combination of substances
according to the needs of a specific
[SPEAKER_02]: patient, you have personalized medicine
the right amount over the right amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of you guys were mentioning data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now the next question is, what is the
role of regulation and compliance within
[SPEAKER_03]: tech?
[SPEAKER_03]: And GDPR is just one of them, but would
anyone like to take that one on first?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can take a stab at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we work pretty heavily on the GACP and
GMP side of things, largely with our LP
[SPEAKER_06]: clients up in Canada and with some of the
clients we work out here out in Europe
[SPEAKER_06]: with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the large portion of that is in the
process flow, right, of how people,
[SPEAKER_06]: plants, and products move throughout these
facilities and tracking that.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of GMP compliance and GACP
compliance come with a chain of commands,
[SPEAKER_06]: right, understanding really what happens
in these facilities and what happens to
[SPEAKER_06]: this plant throughout its growth stages
and leveraging technology to get together
[SPEAKER_06]: that data so that we can create that chain
of commands, right, and we can show that
[SPEAKER_06]: very clearly throughout from seed all the
way through sale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Zia, I mean, this is also an issue,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So your system is going to be using AI,
but potentially can be pushed to very
[SPEAKER_03]: personal devices and wearable devices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see privacy and GDPR being an
issue?
[SPEAKER_03]: And beyond that, what other regulatory
issues do you see crossing into this
[SPEAKER_03]: space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we are a German-based company,
but the reason why we are going actually
[SPEAKER_00]: to start at U.S., of course, it's the
biggest market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason is because of the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, European GDPR regulations does not
really allow personal assistant to suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you know, a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big problem with voice assistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like medical device license.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get to that, and we are planning to
go for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the beginning, U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is more liberal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are their own
limitations, and we are talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational and medical cannabis in U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: drug, not only government limitation,
but also different corporate limitations
[SPEAKER_00]: or banking limitations, what we are like
facing once we are going to such market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we feel how it changes that really,
I mean, recently, I mean, from our
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, for instance, Apple was not
really supporting cannabis-based
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, there are just issues that they
are like welcoming now applications which
[SPEAKER_00]: are considering also cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we observe the change, how not only
legislation is changing, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate policies changing in the
positive side, which is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I want to come back now to Tobias.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, nano is interesting in and of
itself, right, especially in Europe,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it potentially could really sort of
stretch the edges of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you can explain a little bit how
that might be or in terms of, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you have, you are using a new kind of
technology like nano, and it is delivering
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids into the cellular level.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you are starting to talk about
manufacturing at a cellular level in a
[SPEAKER_03]: human body, which is pretty wild,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that is also pressing,
certainly in Europe, there are all sorts
[SPEAKER_03]: of laws that discuss those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you comment on that and sort of where
you see your technology developing in a
[SPEAKER_03]: strange regulatory space just because of
the unusual status of the technology and
[SPEAKER_03]: how it impacts the human body?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me just a few minutes, and I answer
in two points.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, the definition of a nanomaterial
given by the EU regulatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the framework is, the definition is
if you are below 100 nanometers,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have a solid, and if it is not
biodegradable, then you have a technically
[SPEAKER_02]: produced nanomaterial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this needs extra testing, safety
standards, so on and so on, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a nanoscale metal inside of
one of your cells, it can cause oxidative
[SPEAKER_02]: stress, inflammation, degradation of
proteins, all sorts of problems that you
[SPEAKER_02]: do not want to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for our systems, they are in the
range below 100 nanometers, our carrier
[SPEAKER_02]: systems, but they are liquids,
and they are absolutely biodegradable
[SPEAKER_02]: because we build them with regular food
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant oils, lecithin as emulsifier and
some other substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those particles, they do not cross the
barrier of your cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not really go into your cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: They help active, fat-soluble substances
to be transported into your cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a different way of transportation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are not producing nanomaterials
according to EU regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is no harm in our carrier
systems because they follow the,
[SPEAKER_02]: after releasing the active ingredients
they transport, they follow the standard
[SPEAKER_02]: route of digestion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to throw out another one,
because actually, for those of you who
[SPEAKER_03]: have been wandering around outside,
there's a really cool 3D printed personal
[SPEAKER_03]: oil maker, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to sort of come back into this
idea of 3D printing.
[SPEAKER_03]: How and where do you see 3D printing
making an impact on this industry
[SPEAKER_03]: generally, and why, and where?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll start with Tobias.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you 3D print your patch?
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is anybody else on the construction side
or the greenhouse side?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can you see 3D printing playing a
role or not?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would be tough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think where you may be able to see it is
maybe in sensor technology, possibly,
[SPEAKER_06]: to where you have a small, let's say,
something similar to a Raspberry Pi,
[SPEAKER_06]: where you could build a modular around
that and be able to mass produce that off
[SPEAKER_06]: a 3D printer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially in our world, we try to
streamline everything we can when we're
[SPEAKER_06]: building out these facilities so that
there's not very customizable,
[SPEAKER_06]: very hard to get pieces and parts.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the event that there are,
that is a lot of times where 3D printing
[SPEAKER_06]: can be leveraged.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to throw this open to the
audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anybody has questions, can you put
your hand up?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll try and get a mic to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody now?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have already a question here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should wear my glasses more often.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first, thanks a lot for the insight.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was super interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to go a bit further into,
I guess it's more to feel where Tobias is
[SPEAKER_05]: active.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you've been talking about
cultivation, and this is about
[SPEAKER_05]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be interested in what perspective
or potential would you see for new
[SPEAKER_05]: technologies in certain drug development,
like new stuff like you do, basically,
[SPEAKER_05]: nanotechnology, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think there would also be
possibilities to improve, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever, you name it, flowers or
different new extracts?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do you see other potentials of
technology in making new cannabis drugs?
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't only ask you, by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You all can answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody, I think, could answer that one,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it can have a huge impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you look at using technology
and growing, it can be from the light
[SPEAKER_00]: that's adopted from the climate which is
adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we heard a lot about AI being used and
not only optimizing, but that's also
[SPEAKER_00]: optimizing growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the more we were discussing
yesterday with one company, here also that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are trying to communicate with the
plant and crack and manipulate the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more or less bio-cracking the
growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there's a lot has been done in
other plants and again, it's coming and
[SPEAKER_00]: will be entering to cannabis growing as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to answer that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to add that we're now at about
production cost of a kilogram of the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest flower quality that you can buy at
about 500 euro per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if that's a high or low
number around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume that for the highest
quality that you can buy, that is a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: decent price for production all in,
meaning facility and depreciation,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That number will come down because there
are new technologies that will reduce the
[SPEAKER_01]: price of growing and it will increase the
cost of the yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those are happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're continuously happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: AI adds to that so that that number will
come down.
[SPEAKER_01]: In part it has to because prices will come
down too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite as fast, but we are looking at
that at any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always how can we produce better at a
lower price?
[SPEAKER_01]: And technology, we could go into many
different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from the water delivery system
nutrient delivery system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all, anything about knowledge about
the temperature and humidity in your grow
[SPEAKER_01]: facility, the drying process.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that is continuously evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have never built two of the same
facilities because there's always new
[SPEAKER_01]: things coming and it's really,
really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what other place can you go where you
can just continuously innovate and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really, that's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that question.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a question here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a comment on the whole 3D
printing discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from the Danish company Drizzle and we
create small extractors designed for
[SPEAKER_04]: personal use so the end user can do their
own customized, personalized cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've managed to get a complete
extraction system down to this size,
[SPEAKER_04]: about two kilograms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And doing so has required a few innovative
steps and one of them has to do with
[SPEAKER_04]: plastic and 3D printing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we've really investigated into using
plastic instead of stainless steel because
[SPEAKER_04]: stainless steel is super expensive to work
with and it's kind of the go-to thing when
[SPEAKER_04]: you do chemical processing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we figured out how to use plastic in
chemical harsh environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once that was in place and we could do
that in a food safe environment,
[SPEAKER_04]: the next obvious state for us at least was
to do the entire thing using 3D print.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has actually led to some really
interesting derivative advantages in what
[SPEAKER_04]: we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's specifically three things when
it comes to 3D printing and 3D printing in
[SPEAKER_04]: production that we've discovered.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first one is innovation speed.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you do stuff in stainless steel,
you need to have someone do the drawings,
[SPEAKER_04]: you need to mill something out,
you need to test it and ship it,
[SPEAKER_04]: blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And takes usually up to a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you 3D print, you can sit down over a
coffee table, sketch something out,
[SPEAKER_04]: print it, test it in the evening,
figure out what's wrong with it,
[SPEAKER_04]: and next cycle the next day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of having iterative cycles of
one month, you're down to one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really supercharges your innovation
speed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to interrupt you here
for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, that actually, I was showing
that product to a GMP distributor here in
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his first comment was, yeah,
it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 3D printed, but actually that's
technically illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here in Germany, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, that's one of those areas where
I think that, I mean, as much as,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a personal discussion,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to make can of butter in
your microwave versus using your system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, that's, I think, a place where
technology is also crossing into a new
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people can actually make oil at home
more easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how does that then become a standard
that the medical environment, that the
[SPEAKER_03]: medical community can accept?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are many, many different questions I
think that's coming together with your
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to sort of, we'll come back to
you, but what I'd like to do is sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: open it up to other questions here,
unless you had another point to make.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had two quick points I'd like to make.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second one was size, because when
you 3D print stuff, you can put in details
[SPEAKER_04]: that are impossible to make with other
production methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means that you can shrink both
size and cost of your products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's important when you do consumer
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the final thing is production,
because it's quite easy to set up scalable
[SPEAKER_04]: production facilities with 3D print.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just need a bunch of 3D printers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can set up clusters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say we want to produce in the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just set up printing farm in the
US, Asia, and just send files.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have the exact same production
globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you kind of have a global and local
approach to production.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really interesting to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I'm going to have a quick round
robin here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like you guys to do this really
fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the biggest challenges and
opportunities of technology in this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's AI and the appropriate use to
develop better methods to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, research science is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to find out more new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's frustrating because often things
don't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's expensive because it takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's challenging to explain to future
customers or partners why it is necessary
[SPEAKER_02]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do research when you do not know what will
be the outcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's keeping focused on the goal
ahead, not reinventing the wheel and
[SPEAKER_06]: leveraging parallel industries to further
this cannabis industry into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe right now, legislation and
limitations, that's a big challenge for
[SPEAKER_00]: kinetic to be developed in the level where
it can be developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only in tech, but in general cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that's the biggest challenge,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any more questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I'm going to actually come,
maybe our last question.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you see the role of technology in
research and development of new drugs
[SPEAKER_03]: generally, if not the advancement of
understanding of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, I can start off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, my background's actually in
commercial vegetable production before I
[SPEAKER_06]: started growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think a lot what needs to be focused
on now is largely on the cultivation side,
[SPEAKER_06]: but more specifically is on the genetic
side of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a lot of misunderstanding
around really what these genetics are and
[SPEAKER_06]: what sort of cannabinoids they produce and
what sort of environments produce those
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids of that genetic, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think a lot of it needs to be
focused on gene editing and understanding
[SPEAKER_06]: these genetic codes that we have and the
cultivation systems we use to identify
[SPEAKER_06]: these things and bring them out in this
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an amazing flower that we have,
but it really comes down to the
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivation side of things and the
environment that you put that plant in to
[SPEAKER_06]: allow those genes to come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, last call.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more questions from the audience?
[SPEAKER_03]: No?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have burning questions,
you can look us up later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I'd like to do is end just a
little bit quickly unless anybody would
[SPEAKER_03]: like to have last closing comments
generally about technology or what you
[SPEAKER_03]: were doing with technology that's cool and
awesome that we need to know about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I'm talking a lot here,
but automation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I love automation.
[SPEAKER_06]: When push comes to shove, the industry
needs to commercialize and it needs to
[SPEAKER_06]: optimize itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that comes down to, as Mark was
referring to, is cost production.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really need to adopt things that we've
learned from our Dutch partners in terms
[SPEAKER_06]: of bringing plants to people and not
people to plants, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to limit our human touching as
much as this is a very artistic thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is for you to do at home.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when we're doing this on a medical
platform, on a commercial platform,
[SPEAKER_06]: we really need to leverage technology and
automation and those systems therein to
[SPEAKER_06]: create a consistent quality product for
the globe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's really where we focus
on at UrbanGrow is leveraging that
[SPEAKER_06]: technology, those systems, and integrating
them all together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zia, do you have any last comments there
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess we mentioned earlier that we see
new technologies being part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and with, I mean, software
development and hardware development will
[SPEAKER_00]: be one of the main stuff which will be
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: This side, anybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what I'm seeing is that we're
still only maybe 10% of the way of where
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies will go in the following
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made a lot of progress, but there's so
many new things happening every single
[SPEAKER_01]: week, and that's to do with lights and
nutrients and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: This industry will change, and it's
exciting to see it change and get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that certainly, and with fewer
diseases, fewer pest pressure,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will get a lot better and healthier
over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you like the last word here?
[SPEAKER_02]: The exact last word.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more science.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more research in this field.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to solve the problems and not just
ignore them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we all need to be curious and
excited about what we do and try to
[SPEAKER_02]: improve ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one last call for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: No?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys for all being part of the
panel.
Thank you.
