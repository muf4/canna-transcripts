[SPEAKER_05]: Here to talk about the emergence of global
cannabis brands, because that's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a great panel from all over the
world, and to lead us in this,
[SPEAKER_05]: she's the co-founder of the Global
Cannabis Network Collective.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do great work, and they throw great
parties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put your hands together and welcome Jill
Reddish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go with the mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: As my panel comes to take their seats,
thank you for being here again after
[SPEAKER_02]: lunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a really exciting discussion
planned for you all today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, to get started, I want to do a
little audience interaction first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think to yourself if you have a favorite
cannabis brand, picture it in your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Picture the logo, the colors, all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Raise your hand if you actually have a
favorite brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Raise your hand if you have a favorite
brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few people in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep your hand raised if there is a
cannabis leaf in the branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a few hands raised.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put your hand up if you live in a new
market, only about two to three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have people from all over the market
evolution here.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we get into the panel, some of those
questions will make a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to kick it off, as Ngayo said,
I am Jill Reddish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the co-founder of the Global Cannabis
Network Collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a private executive network for
international cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We create connections all across the
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also do a lot of thought leadership for
our members.
[SPEAKER_02]: My background is in marketing and
communication, so it's a really nice
[SPEAKER_02]: synergy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, I'm excited to ask my
panelists to introduce themselves because
[SPEAKER_02]: they all have really incredible
backgrounds that I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: accidentally screw up, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here to my left, Jamie Pearson,
please, will you give yourself a brief
[SPEAKER_02]: introduction with your friend?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Jamie Pearson.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the founder and president of the New
Holland Group, which is a global
[SPEAKER_03]: consultancy, and I specialize in helping
brands and companies that want to cross
[SPEAKER_03]: borders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think my claim to fame is that I ran
the global brand Bang, which is known for
[SPEAKER_03]: our award-winning 11-time cannabis cup
infused chocolate, and know a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: about cannabis branding and the challenges
of crossing borders.
[SPEAKER_03]: So companies hire me to save money and
time by not making avoidable mistakes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Lauren.
[SPEAKER_06]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the cannabis god.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the godfather of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took the first cannabis company public
in the world in 2004.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm probably best known for three
cannabis companies that I sold,
[SPEAKER_06]: one in 2017 called Synapsis, sorry,
2016 Synapsis, 2017 Kronos, and in 2018 I
[SPEAKER_06]: sold Tokyo Smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: The combined of the three were Unicorn.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my passion and mission in life is to
make the world a better place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Through cannabis and design excellence.
[SPEAKER_06]: And currently, I'm the chairman of a
company called Kana Global.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have partners all over the world in
the cannabis business, specifically Choco,
[SPEAKER_06]: my friend Cedric, and Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have partners pretty much in
everywhere in the world today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're building the probably first
global cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to add in, I appreciate how you
came to focus on the cannabis experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, you have a very extensive,
amazing branding experience outside of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis with a lot of consumer and retail
brands as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So amazing welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for interest, I grew up in the
branding business.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my father was in the clothing
business.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I learned how to build brands early on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm an architect by training.
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, the design excellence is the
key to building a brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Tokyo Smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the name, it was the community,
it was design.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really was telling the world that
we were gonna be the Starbucks of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Lauren.
[SPEAKER_02]: And next up, Alex.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's easy to follow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, my name is Alex Bransky, co-founder
and operator of The Higher Circle,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is a cannabis brand support agency,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_07]: We help brands figure out optimization of
their supply chain, resources,
[SPEAKER_07]: and branding and developing products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before that, I was one of the builders and
operators of a few early brands in
[SPEAKER_07]: California, and really just early
participant in the regulated cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Narquise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Jill.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Narquise Tesler.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from Israel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made it here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to fly through Larnaca,
and then we got to Vienna and finally got
[SPEAKER_04]: to Berlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medicang Group is an Israeli
cultivator.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an indoor cultivation facility
that's basically a high-tech facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started with our first brand was the
name Seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven is a purely medical brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we launched Seven, the whole industry
was just about tons of products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we realized that if we're gonna make
it here, we have to really do a good job
[SPEAKER_04]: of branding, that it was time for the
industry to be branded.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we launched our first product,
looked totally different from any other
[SPEAKER_04]: product in the market, and that's what
made it survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have brand recognition, and the fact
that when you see all packaging,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you see that it's something
different, and you gotta stand out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, guys, we can't
advertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to find a way to stand out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's our first brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an established brand in Israel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's known for being premium medical
cannabis that doesn't compromise,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's a brand you can trust.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having said that, two months ago,
based on our reputation with Seven,
[SPEAKER_04]: we launched our new brand called Solo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Solo is a brand for the connoisseurs of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has sexy genetics that are brought to
the fullest when we put them in the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics we bought from overseas,
and we grow them in our indoor cultivation
[SPEAKER_04]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really brought out the very best of
these really sexy genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the power of branding is that once we
have had our brand, when we went to the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmacist's B2B, and they knew that we
were named that they could trust,
[SPEAKER_04]: then they just, without even trying,
they bought out all that we had.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the power of branding,
and I'm a really, really big believer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're ready to go out of Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Narquise.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna circle back to you a little
bit more to dive in more in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we are here to talk about
the evolution of branding and how that can
[SPEAKER_02]: work across the global supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first, I just want to level set for
everybody here and kind of define a brand
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite definition of what a brand is,
is what people say about you when you are
[SPEAKER_02]: not in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so brands include both hard and soft
attributes, hard attributes kind of being
[SPEAKER_02]: that logo, the colors, what does the
packaging look like, what is the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: product, of course, and then also those
softer attributes, the personality,
[SPEAKER_02]: the emotion that it evokes in you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to hear more about that
from these amazing panelists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to circle back, Narquise, you began to
touch on the two brands that you have and
[SPEAKER_02]: began to delineate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us just a little bit more about that,
dig in a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you could give us kind of a
timeline of how long did it take for these
[SPEAKER_02]: things to develop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of folks go to digital
marketing agencies and say, design me a
[SPEAKER_02]: logo, throw it up on a website,
and we're good, we have a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot more complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So much more complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, you have to make sure that
you're branding what you want to brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to make sure that one message
that gives you the unfair advantage,
[SPEAKER_04]: that that's what's getting across.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we started with the packaging,
like I said.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in our market, we can't
advertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have a lot of room to do
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we started with the packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were lucky because the packaging really
stood out and we had really good genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: even from day one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we were extra lucky because our
signature product was perfect for Israel
[SPEAKER_04]: PTSD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have a product that works for PTSD
and the patients write back to you and
[SPEAKER_04]: say, this is doing well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's helping me with my condition.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not making me paranoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can continue doing my work with using
this product.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one product is what really got us
off the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three years later, one product's not
enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we hadn't built it into our brand when
we introduced the other products,
[SPEAKER_04]: we have a total of six products in the
seven brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we launched each product,
because we had already branded the
[SPEAKER_04]: concept, then the other products just
rolled right in and they knew what to
[SPEAKER_04]: expect from the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the power of the brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we took time, but cannabis time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know in the other world, the rest of the
world, most of us can't remember where we
[SPEAKER_04]: came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a lot longer to build a brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the cannabis industry,
everything is on high speed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it took time, but not that long.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we launched our solo brand,
it was like that because we had the
[SPEAKER_04]: reputation of the seven brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one actually complemented the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're creating an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just give the audience a little
bit of an update on the market there in
[SPEAKER_02]: Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some medical markets, patients don't
really get to have a choice in what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're getting in from their pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you just give us a little
explanation there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Israel's market is going through
rapid change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprise, surprise.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the 1st of April, we have a new reform
that went into effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a growing reform.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will take about a year before all of it
goes into effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what happens in Israel is until now,
you had to get a medical license.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you got a medical license,
then you would go and have your
[SPEAKER_04]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_04]: The prescription would say which category
you can use, how much THC, how much CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you could go in and look at a menu of
a drug store, look at the menu,
[SPEAKER_04]: and decide what product you want out of
those categories.
[SPEAKER_04]: One difference, which is pretty,
made a huge difference, is that the first
[SPEAKER_04]: time you go in and the first product you
can get had to be from the category,
[SPEAKER_04]: that was one by one on one, balanced THC,
CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that changed the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one little, they wrote it about this
big in the regulations, changed the market
[SPEAKER_04]: because someone coming in, they had to
have something that wasn't this how much
[SPEAKER_04]: THC can I get.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that made a huge difference in the
market and the way the market behaved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in this new, the new regulations that
are coming through, you don't have to have
[SPEAKER_04]: a license.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start, you just go to your
professional, the person who treats your
[SPEAKER_04]: condition, and he can write a
prescription.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we expect the market to really,
really grow really, really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The market evolution there is something
that I want to circle back to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, I know that you're looking to
expand, and I want to hear from the
[SPEAKER_02]: panelists a little bit about what to look
for in expanding with different brand
[SPEAKER_02]: partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Alex, if that's something that you
could take, because I know you have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of experience growing from different
markets, Southern California, Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: California, and East Coast of the US,
all quite unique markets right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you could share some of your
comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think when you look at expanding a
brand, you've already established yourself
[SPEAKER_07]: in whatever your base market is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you have hopefully some
efficiencies in that time in your supply
[SPEAKER_07]: chain.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's one of the most
important things that can be overlooked
[SPEAKER_07]: when you're expanding into a new market is
you have to understand that a new market
[SPEAKER_07]: is probably a lot of new operators.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to know who is, let's say,
experienced and has different skill
[SPEAKER_07]: levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's very important to vet all of the
different operators in the market,
[SPEAKER_07]: know who your partners are in your supply
chain before you get too far along,
[SPEAKER_07]: because obviously small problems can
become big ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once along the way very quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just understanding your business model
and who you're going to be getting into
[SPEAKER_07]: business with in that market and knowing
that your retail outlets, as you expand,
[SPEAKER_07]: are going to be viable and accept your
branding and your products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for outlining those things for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, actually, Lauren, I'd love to
hear from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you could share a little bit of the
background about Tokyo Smoke, the
[SPEAKER_02]: evolution there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as you share that story,
we'll hear the evolution of the market and
[SPEAKER_02]: the kinds of things that Alex just touched
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, Lauren, if you could share the story
about Tokyo Smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to do that in a few minutes,
but we started out to build a global
[SPEAKER_06]: brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really about building a global
brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was very much about my DNA that I'd
spent already 30 years building my brand,
[SPEAKER_06]: which was part of the DNA of Tokyo Smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've sold Tokyo Smoke in 2018.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go into a Tokyo Smoke store today,
it looks exactly the same way it looked
[SPEAKER_06]: because our DNA was so strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think our success was building a
community.
[SPEAKER_06]: From day one, we were an education
retailer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of our great tricks was,
you know, give us your email address and
[SPEAKER_06]: we'll send you a pack of rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we sent out probably 25,000 packs
of rolling papers, and that started to
[SPEAKER_06]: build a community.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I started traveling around the
world and meeting with kings, queens,
[SPEAKER_06]: prime ministers, heads of state,
and the CEOs of the largest companies in
[SPEAKER_06]: the world telling them about how we were
going to change their lives.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that stock, Tokyo Smoke stock,
everywhere we went.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even today, it's still the,
I think, the most notable brand in the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Accepting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, speaking of, Jamie, will you
outline the history of Bang for us as well
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, illustrate for the audience
the journey that Bang has gone through
[SPEAKER_02]: with market evolution as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, was it starting out with
everybody really wanting the highest THC
[SPEAKER_02]: and then, you know, where are we now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the first thing I want to say is
people often confuse products with brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's, I brought Lorna Bang
chocolate, allegedly.
[SPEAKER_03]: People confuse brands with products,
and a brand is not a product, and that
[SPEAKER_03]: happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also think people confuse companies
with brands, and those two things are not
[SPEAKER_03]: the same either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Bang was a, it started out as a
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a chocolate bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it started out, we're talking
about 2010, you could buy a brownie that
[SPEAKER_03]: would have in Sharpie on a Ziploc bag,
one gram of cannabis was used to make this
[SPEAKER_03]: brownie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the founder of Bang, who was a master
chocolatier, said, this is medicine,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is crazy, we have to elevate so that
people could actually know how much
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis they were going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, fast forward, Bang was known for its
logo, it was known for its tagline,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was known for its packaging,
all of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I did when I came in,
they hired me to expand the brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I got there, we were in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I left, we were in seven states,
Canada, and I just took our CBD brand
[SPEAKER_03]: prior to Novel Foods into Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I did is made sure that we were
speaking with one unified voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the one, because a brand voice is
super important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the one thing that I had a mandate
from the CEO, who was CEO before I took
[SPEAKER_03]: over, was we're not going to use the
obvious Bang as sex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because imagine all of the things,
Bang well, Bang often.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wanted to use Bang as sex.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not want that to be our brand
voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, this plant is female,
I have a daughter, I want to be proud when
[SPEAKER_03]: people talk about Bang.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want them to be talking about quality,
I want them to be talking about different
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we made sure that our brand voice spoke
to a particular audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I did is I actually headhunted a
brand expert, a brand expert in voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you guys, raise your hand if you
know the brand, 19 Crimes Wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so short story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went in the grocery store on a way to a
birthday party.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought a bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: The checker made me stop what I was doing,
made everybody go to another line,
[SPEAKER_03]: and showed me the augmented reality of how
to make that label come to life using the
[SPEAKER_03]: Living Wine Label app.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, how did this person turn
the checker in the grocery store into a
[SPEAKER_03]: brand ambassador?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I called a girlfriend of mine that does
headhunting in the wine industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Found the woman that did that brand,
headhunted her, and she became my head of
[SPEAKER_03]: brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she- Very smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: The brand voice of 19 Crimes, she modeled
after Jax from Sons of Anarchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said, women who are 35 buy wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our biggest buyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was cheap Australian wine,
and I need to get the women that are
[SPEAKER_03]: between 28 and 36, you gotta know your
demographic, who are you talking to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are you talking to with your voice?
[SPEAKER_03]: I need those women to buy my brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna talk to them in their voice,
I'm gonna be aspirational.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wanted to have sex with Jax from
Sons of Anarchy, so I'm gonna talk to them
[SPEAKER_03]: in the bad boy voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how 19 Crimes was built,
and it was that voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you think about it, every bottle
is a criminal, the whole thing was about
[SPEAKER_03]: crime, and the voice was the voice of a
criminal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter, you don't have to speak
the voice of your customer, you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: speak to your customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she and I did the collab together with
Jim Belushi, and it was a fun project,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he came here and talked about it a
couple times.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the evolution went all the way full
circle, but our biggest issue,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in going global, was making sure
that we didn't use any false friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called, so I'll just give you one
example, and then I'll turn the mic over,
[SPEAKER_03]: Clairol did a product in Germany that was
a curling iron that would give off little
[SPEAKER_03]: steam, and they called it a mist stick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now in German, the word mist means shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And schtick, you know what schtick means,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they named their curling iron a shit
stick, and that's the type of mistake that
[SPEAKER_03]: brands make when they don't understand how
to cross cultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things that I did,
having lived in Europe and America for the
[SPEAKER_03]: last 30 years, is I made absolutely sure
we didn't make any of those missteps.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Alex talked about supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Supply chain's after your brand's been
built, but he's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to make sure your brand works
across supply chain, and those are some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the voice, just some of the basics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I learned a lot of that the hard
way in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to just add that I think the
clearer you are about your brand and what
[SPEAKER_06]: it is, the easier it is for people to
accept.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think a moment for us was when my
son said to me, we're going to be the
[SPEAKER_06]: Starbucks of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were in a conference like this,
and there were two slides, and he showed
[SPEAKER_06]: Tokyo Smoke's logo, and he showed
Starbucks' logo, and that stood in
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody's mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes a mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also everybody in this room knows what
it means to be the Starbucks of something,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's almost the epitome of branding
right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think today we're building Choco,
and Choco's going to be the Soho house of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we want to get it early in somebody's
mind exactly what we're going to be,
[SPEAKER_06]: so they know it, and they get it,
and they associate it with something else.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easier with a frame of reference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I want to turn to talk a little bit
about where a market is, how to know where
[SPEAKER_02]: your market is, the kind of audiences that
we're going to talk, that you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, regulations play an important
role of what you can and can't do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always workarounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always loopholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to hear, I'm going to just
throw this out, whoever wants to jump in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's focus in on Germany, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cultivation model right now,
there's a lot of things you can't do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to find out a lot more about
what people can do as we see people do
[SPEAKER_02]: things and take risks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to hear from each of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What excites you?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of opportunities do you see for
here in Germany for branding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Narquise, you want to go first?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to let one of you guys start,
because I don't know enough about the
[SPEAKER_04]: brands in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward to learning about
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're here doing market research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll jump in on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think on the rec side of things,
with the social club model, the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations are nebulous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from an American standpoint,
that's wide open.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Germans are going to say, you can't do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says it has to be nondescript.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, describe nondescript.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you haven't done that very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to exploit that to the ends
of the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I anticipate will happen with the
social club model is my social club is
[SPEAKER_03]: better than your social club.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be like the football team
concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have brands so that when
you send flower out the door, the
[SPEAKER_03]: companies want people to know where that
flower came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you think about 25 grams is
what you can have on your person when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're out in public, that's one gram
joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who needs 25 joints in their
pocket at any one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I got 25 one gram joints in my
pocket and they're packaged in a brand,
[SPEAKER_03]: we know that they're going to end up in
other people's hands and that's how you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to start building a brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think on the consumption side,
on the social side, we're going to see
[SPEAKER_03]: branding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're going to be Germans who
are going to take those risks too.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the medical side, that's what I'm
excited about because I do think the
[SPEAKER_03]: majority of cannabis in the US is used for
medical reasons, sleep, pain, anxiety,
[SPEAKER_03]: cramps, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be used medically
also in Germany, but people are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: want the government to reimburse them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to want to use their
disposable cash because why would you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you go to a social club and
spend a bunch of money when you can just
[SPEAKER_03]: have the government pay for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll get there, maybe not
initially, but eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there's an opportunity for
brands in the medical side of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really where I'm focused.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you said about the social clubs being
the first to jump out and brand,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think is pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the US, we have a lot of retailers
moving to branding themselves and putting
[SPEAKER_07]: their brand into people's pockets as
opposed to selling somebody else's.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a lot of creative leeway,
as you said, for social clubs to find ways
[SPEAKER_07]: and especially as you're bringing a lot of
people from the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_07]: together.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already there, but bringing them in a
place where now there's a stamp that says
[SPEAKER_07]: this is legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: People are going to be more open and
willing to conversate and talk about what
[SPEAKER_07]: they like in the market and what brands
stick out to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a great opportunity for the
social clubs to be the first to take that
[SPEAKER_07]: leap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis people are workaround people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's who we've always had to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis people also really care about
where their weed comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: What goes in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's growing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex, you've had a lot of experience with
that with Humboldt's Finest in the
[SPEAKER_02]: California community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us a little bit about the
market there and the appetite for people
[SPEAKER_02]: to know who's behind their brand and how
it's grown?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: In California, it took a little while to
get people interested in where their weed
[SPEAKER_07]: came from.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even today, I think- At least in the legal
market where we're talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the legal market, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's conversation with Budtender and
information on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing we learned very quickly when
retail became super abundant is your
[SPEAKER_07]: Budtender is your best point of access to
your consumer.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to, as a brand, have these very
short, quick moments with consumers to try
[SPEAKER_07]: to educate them.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have very concise,
powerful messages in order to really make
[SPEAKER_07]: it stick in their mind because they're
kids in a candy store.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's loud packaging all around them and
a lot of like, buy this, half off.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very hard to really get their
attention to something valuable.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you have a Budtender that's excited
and educated on your brand, as she
[SPEAKER_07]: mentioned with the 19 crimes wine,
they sent everyone to the other line just
[SPEAKER_07]: to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you can find, and it's going to be
different in every market and even to a
[SPEAKER_07]: degree every store, what excites that
cannabis community the Budtender is the
[SPEAKER_07]: catalyst for all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually at Bang had a two-tiered
marketing strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a direct to consumer marketing
strategy where we spoke to our consumers,
[SPEAKER_03]: but then we had a Budtender strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all about putting swag in their
hands and educating the Budtender about
[SPEAKER_03]: Bang so that when the clientele that
bought chocolate wasn't usually the
[SPEAKER_03]: 24-year-old male, our clientele were
people that wanted to usually use it for
[SPEAKER_03]: sleep so it was an older demographic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting Budtenders excited about chocolate
was really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did collabs with flower brands and
pre-roll brands where we would give away
[SPEAKER_03]: other brands, pre-rolls, and flowers so we
could get the Budtender to sit still and
[SPEAKER_03]: listen about the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: When older people came in, they would
actually know something and that was
[SPEAKER_03]: actually really effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also have to understand sometimes you
have a gatekeeper and you got to get
[SPEAKER_03]: around that gatekeeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was why we had to have two
strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hearing with that that I just want to
point out that the market evolution kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of follows this typical pattern of a
market launches first and people really
[SPEAKER_02]: want flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want high THC and once they kind of
get that, okay, then there's more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're more curious about other consumption
methods like chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Creating that direct bridge is a really
effective strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Narquise, I'd love to hear from you if
there's anything different or tactics that
[SPEAKER_02]: you have implemented for the Israeli
market for the consumer education,
[SPEAKER_02]: the pharmacies, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course, just as Jamie said,
we have two audiences.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have those who are selling the product
and we have to market to them just as if
[SPEAKER_04]: they were the target audience while at the
same time we're targeting our actual
[SPEAKER_04]: target audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard because we're not allowed to
advertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not allowed to say that our product
does what it does and we're in the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_04]: We found that one way to educate the
customer and this is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: The customer doesn't know what it is he
needs to do to make the cannabis work for
[SPEAKER_04]: him.
[SPEAKER_04]: We found that was very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: We put together a podcast which I gave but
wasn't obviously seven because we're not
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just gave a podcast about cannabis
sponsored by seven and we gave it
[SPEAKER_04]: workaround.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you just have to find a way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took off really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about the regulations,
what you need to do to get a license.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we brought in doctors that say,
I have a specific medical condition,
[SPEAKER_04]: what do I need to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: What cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I know what to start with?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we brought on doctors and I would
interview them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would make sure that they gave as much
information as they could, very short
[SPEAKER_04]: podcasts.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't have a large attention span.
[SPEAKER_04]: The brand name is seven, so what was the
podcast?
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got to make sure everything is
branded and you have to get around.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to get around the regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to get around what's allowed and
what's not allowed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you said something before that
really matters is that strains matter and
[SPEAKER_06]: that's what matters.
[SPEAKER_06]: And strains carry no strong because if
your strain stands for something then you
[SPEAKER_06]: don't have to advertise.
[SPEAKER_06]: They know the strain and everybody knows
the strain they like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said strains win.
[SPEAKER_06]: In every place the strain wins and
whatever that strain is that when the cop
[SPEAKER_06]: or whatever it is, that's what everybody
wants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would say our success is that we
have the largest strain library in the
[SPEAKER_06]: world, whether it's California and whether
it's land race, whether it's Canadian and
[SPEAKER_06]: that's where we'll win across all markets
will be your strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the flower segment for sure and I think
to Narquise's point, you've got to
[SPEAKER_03]: remember that in emerging markets,
the people that are going to walk into the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary are the ones that have the
courage to walk into the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the stigma being as strong as it's
always been, it's like walking into a
[SPEAKER_03]: massage parlor.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't want to have their car in the
parking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't really want to walk in and when
Alex is talking about all the branding
[SPEAKER_03]: being loud, I imagine my mom walking in
and going, oh my gosh, like not a kid in a
[SPEAKER_03]: candy store wanting to run in the other
direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom's probably going to be wave four.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have the young people who
are like, yes, coming in first.
[SPEAKER_03]: The evolution of education has to evolve
with the evolution of the consumer that's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to walk into that store.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens to Lauren's point is,
and we're seeing this in California now,
[SPEAKER_03]: weeds like wine there, some people like
Pinot Noir, some people like Sauvignon
[SPEAKER_03]: Blanc, people start developing a taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know what they want and you need the
strain library if you're in the flower
[SPEAKER_03]: department to really appeal to the
developing taste because people become
[SPEAKER_03]: very sophisticated in their cannabis
palette.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's true obviously for recreational
cannabis, but for medical cannabis it's
[SPEAKER_04]: just as true and that's not what a lot of
people don't understand because once you
[SPEAKER_04]: get the strain, it can be wonderful for me
if I have a specific indication and can do
[SPEAKER_04]: nothing for the person sitting next to me
who needs something different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the education has to get out there and
it's difficult to not helping us out
[SPEAKER_04]: getting that information out there so we
have to find a way around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Helping consumers understand what kind of
questions to ask, the benefit of being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to smell the strain yourself so that
your nose knows and you have your own
[SPEAKER_02]: reaction there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're winding down on time so I do
want to leave it open for questions so
[SPEAKER_02]: start thinking of those and we have some
mics in the back of the room and I think
[SPEAKER_02]: we have a mic for closer up front.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have one last question for my
panelists.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun one while everybody is thinking
of their questions they want to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: Branding and marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's crazy fun creative ideas out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you have all been pitched some
crazy ideas for marketing and branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's some of the craziest ideas that
have come up in the brainstorming room?
[SPEAKER_02]: And have any of them worked?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to start there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys, sausage in Hebrew is called
cabanos.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that sound like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our advertising agency came out and
said, you know what, we're not going to
[SPEAKER_04]: advertise medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to advertise medical cabanos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Medical sausage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you say it sounds like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we took a local stand up, a very famous
stand up comedian and he went on this
[SPEAKER_04]: really posh commercial with a sausage and
he's just talking about associations that
[SPEAKER_04]: you can imagine what they are with a
sausage and having a good time with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Genius.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that gets everybody talking about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got viral very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it got us out there in a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't forget that sausage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's not really, I was a bit worried
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be associated with
sausage.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about a connoisseur label
with phenomenal exotic genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're talking about sausage.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people say that we had people coming
up saying on the Facebook and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: people who came and had something to say
about it says, you know, whoever that
[SPEAKER_04]: marketing director is, they need to fire
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they're talking about you,
you're not in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any questions from the
audience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any hands raised?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the super interesting
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed all the knowledge and
sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Ying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the CEO for Trollmaster in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do automation for all different kind of
grow facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a good problem that I would
like your expertise on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of positive feedback from
users who have used the product and who
[SPEAKER_00]: share the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you share a bit more about what the
best way would be to utilize that feedback
[SPEAKER_00]: we get from the community and put it into
our branding?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few branding ambassadors,
but it's very traditional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any expertise you could share
from your side to kind of have better
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say just building brands
throughout the years and kind of having to
[SPEAKER_07]: change and evolve as the consumer market
matures, it's really important to make
[SPEAKER_07]: sure that you're getting a wide range of
feedback.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not small pockets.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think something that a few of my brands
and I'm sure others in the market have
[SPEAKER_07]: dealt with is you get one brand rep coming
back to you like, oh, somebody didn't like
[SPEAKER_07]: the product.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they say it as, people don't like the
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if you're not really diving in
and actually getting real data from the
[SPEAKER_07]: market back and then getting that from a
wide range, you're potentially going to
[SPEAKER_07]: isolate these single cases of,
hey, we need to make this change or that
[SPEAKER_07]: change.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the general market might feel a
different way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think just making sure that you are
thorough in that analysis and that you're
[SPEAKER_07]: able to communicate directly up the chain
with true data from the market is really
[SPEAKER_07]: important.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had a conversation last night
about the fact that TikTok is really
[SPEAKER_03]: what's coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: The generation that's coming up,
they're into TikTok.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that little short burst of
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you ran a TikTok campaign where you
were able to get some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: testimonials on video and you could have
your brand with the testimonial.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the TikTok campaign or the Snapchat
campaign or the Instacampaign is just
[SPEAKER_03]: testimonials.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did this product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Word of mouth is really powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're basically putting the word of
mouth right out into the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do so much with testimonials.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make sure that you choose those
ones that you want to highlight that
[SPEAKER_04]: really highlight the branding,
that really get that message out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The most important thing you want to get
out there, make sure that's what you use
[SPEAKER_04]: in the testimonial.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also add that when you are very
crystal clear on your target audience,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what matters and what doesn't
matter as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as you're very crystal clear on
who you're trying to reach, the 65 and up
[SPEAKER_02]: crowd is going to have different feedback,
care about different things than the 20 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 year old crowd, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you're focused, you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Time for our very last question here,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here representing Isabella Palazzo
from Italy's Association for Medical
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would love to know your thoughts on
the Italian cannabis market for medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't heard so much about Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a branding panel, so I'm not really
sure that that's something that we're up
[SPEAKER_03]: here prepared to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an early market, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, be prepared for what we've
talked about here with the market
[SPEAKER_02]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're all probably happy to
answer other questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I would say that it's huge and
nobody's talking about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We care.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very strict, though, right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go find Claudia de Morella.
[SPEAKER_06]: 60 million people, something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you can, Brian, lean into what people
love about Italy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot to love about that country.
[SPEAKER_07]: Infuse Gravioli.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go find Claudia de Morella.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's working on that very much.
Pesto.
[SPEAKER_05]: Infuse Pesto.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're out of time, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lemons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it again for the whole panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
