[SPEAKER_02]: All right, our final panel of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last but not least, we may have even saved
the best for last.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these people have built beautiful
cannabis companies that have stood the
[SPEAKER_02]: test of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the panel is building a cannabis
company with lasting value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's important, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for long-term thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: To lead us in this, my man, you know him,
you love him, the equity partner at Hybrid
[SPEAKER_02]: Pharma.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a cannabis education and medical
partnerships master at Luce Brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's here for you today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it up for Alex Reves!
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should know me better by now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done so many of these panels that
you'd think you'd know my intro better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, don't get me singing with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, thank you so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a very important panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done a few different panels,
but truly, I believe this is one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: most important panels that I've been a
part of, because it's about scaling your
[SPEAKER_05]: business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And scaling your business is so important.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I was explaining to someone why
they want to come to this 450 show instead
[SPEAKER_05]: of going to smoke at 420, thank you,
by the way, for coming back, is that if
[SPEAKER_05]: you have a business and you don't think
about scaling, it's literally just a job.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're lucky, you'll make 100,000,
150, 200,000 dollars and that's not bad at
[SPEAKER_05]: all, but it's barely a business.
[SPEAKER_05]: A real business is scalable and looks to
the international market to make a lot,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's what I think about business
and that's what a lot of ICBC people want
[SPEAKER_05]: to know about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm here with these awesome panelists.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let them introduce themselves and
I'll introduce myself and then we'll jump
[SPEAKER_05]: into this topic and I'll definitely leave
some time for questions because I'm sure
[SPEAKER_05]: there will be some.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Alexandre kicks us off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, so my name is Alexandre Gaultier.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the VP of Research and Development at
Origin Nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: Origin Nature got licensed in 2020 when we
expanded to the boulder capacity.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're now at 8.5 ton.
[SPEAKER_07]: We sell in Germany, in Australia and in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been named Canada top grower in 2023
and 2024.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been lucky enough to be profitable
since our first quarter with the license.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've been profitable for the last four
years also.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm George Chair.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the Executive Vice President of RAD
Source Technologies.
[SPEAKER_10]: We focus on the cannabis sector as well as
many other sectors.
[SPEAKER_10]: We won best lab equipment from Canada,
two awards in 2022.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we're up for another award
this year as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've scaled as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we got an award winner.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is John, John Leath and I'm from
the Osmedecan group, OMG for short.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Osmedecan group is a biotech
company, laser focused in drug development
[SPEAKER_01]: and clinical evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a number of key products which
are going through clinical trials now in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call Brian.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Brian Staff.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the co-founder of Align Ops Group.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we do is help companies set
themselves up for success long term by
[SPEAKER_09]: helping them scale and set their
operations up from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then also in the state, there's a lot
of distressed assets and I work to help
[SPEAKER_09]: turn those around myself and a team of 16.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the past, scaling wise,
I've worked with a lot of the largest
[SPEAKER_09]: companies throughout North America that
have scaled both successfully and
[SPEAKER_09]: unsuccessfully and got to see what worked
and what hasn't and was able to grow my
[SPEAKER_09]: first consulting firm and sell it to one
of the big MSOs.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're scaling and growing again now.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: A round of applause for these awesome
panelists.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very lucky to have such experience
on the stage with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm Alex Revich.
[SPEAKER_05]: I helped the first ICBC back in 2017.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so amazing to see how big it's grown
and I've been coming back every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Canada, my day job when I'm not doing
ICBC is I have Lush brands who are an
[SPEAKER_05]: edibles contract manufacturer with about
80 products in the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have a pharmacy called Hybrid Farm
which has medical cannabis and
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's me and really excited to do this
topic with you all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I never really like to start with
anything negative at the beginning of a
[SPEAKER_05]: panel, but people were really asking me a
lot about why this is so important,
[SPEAKER_05]: this panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talked about all these crazy
negative stories of what people have done
[SPEAKER_05]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're laughing backstage about some of
these examples of these people who have
[SPEAKER_05]: done bad scaling, whether scale too fast,
scale too slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe let's start with a few examples
of why this is such an important topic to
[SPEAKER_05]: give an example of what kind of disaster
can happen if you don't plan for scaling.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think Canada is riddled with example.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to know that 95% of companies in
Canada are not profitable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Selling at a loss is definitely not
something anybody should be striving for.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, all your favorite names are
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Aurora, Canopy, Tail Ray, XO, all the big
ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: We firmly believe that none of those
scaling up were good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, a lot of those company at first
had a mandate of scaling as fast as they
could.
[SPEAKER_07]: As fast as possible, and we'll see later
what we do with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you saw what happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of those companies don't even grow in
Canada anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: They now contract grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I've seen in the States and you're
talking, you're looking at a person that's
[SPEAKER_10]: been in hundreds of grows.
[SPEAKER_10]: You go in, hey, I've got this great plan.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to do 24 acres under glass and
I'm going to flood the market with flour.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they say, okay, how sustainable is
that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because right now you're getting X amount
per pound.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wholesale.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when you go in and you pull this
flower on the market, it's going to drop
[SPEAKER_10]: the price.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just a never ending, then the
price goes down, it goes down,
[SPEAKER_10]: it goes down.
[SPEAKER_10]: And to the point where now you've priced
yourself out of the market by flooding the
[SPEAKER_10]: market.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you got to really understand your
market and the strategy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you got to understand what parts to
accelerate and what parts to decelerate.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what I've seen as a big issue
with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, I think good on them for
giving a goal to scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly it's because they use someone
else's money because otherwise you
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first question that you need to
ask yourself is can you sell what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually producing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now back in the days when it was just
starting, it was very obvious and
[SPEAKER_01]: transparent from a regulatory perspective
that it wasn't a case of build it and they
[SPEAKER_01]: will come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because no one's going to come if you
can't sell stuff that you actually grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was very perplexed early on looking
at this cost of the scale to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: business and what they could actually
essentially generate as revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the revenue from my analysis was
negligent because what they hadn't
[SPEAKER_01]: surprisingly taken into consideration is
the fact that the regulatory framework
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't allow Australia to grow cannabis
and sell it just to anybody in different
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we all know here we're very
educated in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some reason I don't think anyone
really took that into account and
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore got a bit overzealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build it, they will come and we will sell
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly now those companies are
complaining about imports.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they are saying we can't make any
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well of course they can't make any money
because you can't make money if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to grow something that costs you
$10.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can buy it for $2 it's a commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say good on you for giving it a go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done an awful lot of heavy
lifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for any company that wants to drive
innovation I would suggest that what you
[SPEAKER_01]: would do is you'd identify what the
disease state is that you want to focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you would tinker around what
ingredients and incipients, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD or THC, might address that market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You then take that product from your lab
and you go through the various clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trials to get it to the point of on shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So scale is all about having the right
evidence-based paperwork to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell a product worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise it's a complex market.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different regulations in different
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about what GW did with the
Epidiolex they focused on registering a
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine and that's why they can actually
be recognized worldwide as a registered
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's important what you said also
about the investment.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I like to joke if you wouldn't
use your children's college fund money on
[SPEAKER_05]: it don't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because investors are giving you
money now I can tell you that ship does
[SPEAKER_05]: not last for a long time and then when it
stops coming you're out of luck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brian what do you think?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean I'll tie into that which is the
investment may be here now and there may
[SPEAKER_09]: be ample funds to be able to find in this
market today.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I could speak from experience in other
markets where as the industry evolves if
[SPEAKER_09]: you're not returning for your investors
because you have not scaled properly or
[SPEAKER_09]: have not built the business properly that
investment will dry up quickly which makes
[SPEAKER_09]: it exponentially more difficult to achieve
your goals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah and we're going to jump a little more
into investment later on because that's
[SPEAKER_05]: such an important part of this and we'll
talk about in a moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know since we start off with
something negative and all these disaster
[SPEAKER_05]: stories of what happens if you don't plan
to scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about some examples of people
who have scaled.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you have some of your own examples
and don't be shy to talk about them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know let's talk about who's done
it right because some people have done it
[SPEAKER_05]: right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not many but some.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm a little bit biased but I'm going
to name us Origin Nature of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our vision was really crawl walk one.
[SPEAKER_07]: So campus you need to understand is the
most well established black market
[SPEAKER_07]: industry in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know there wasn't really ever an
oversupply in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was big companies that grew a bunch
of shit weed that they couldn't sell at
[SPEAKER_07]: the price.
[SPEAKER_07]: They produced it at and so they placed it
as overproduction because that's what they
[SPEAKER_07]: had to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: We first started by meeting the first
demand that was there in front of us so we
[SPEAKER_07]: went to see the SQDC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is the government the government
control Quebec and the distribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we asked them what do you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want a sativa five dollar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to build that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once we met that demand and we were able
to grow a live plant consistently whether
[SPEAKER_07]: it was from the flower aspect the
cannabinoid aspect and we were able to
[SPEAKER_07]: build some brand recognition.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's when we decided to go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also but died by that time it was a
project that started with six point six
[SPEAKER_07]: million dollars and we did a dividend
payout of one point five million dollars
[SPEAKER_07]: after 18 months.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we did secure an investors before
actually moving ahead and expanding.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we did that expansion we didn't also
place all our eggs in the same basket.
[SPEAKER_07]: We right away decided to go to Germany to
go to Australia.
[SPEAKER_07]: Contract growing also.
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't just assume that everything we
were going to produce was going to go to
[SPEAKER_07]: the rec market like before.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we made sure to diversify.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always have a plan A a plan B a plan C
because things fall out really quickly in
[SPEAKER_07]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we really took our time to crawl walk
run.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another good expansion is the one that
Canada did in Quebec.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you don't know tea God like to
invest a lot of money in super impressive
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouses when I think they did 60
million can get it back for 12 million.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't turn back on the entire
facility when they got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're renting a lot of it to other
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: They turned on little section per little
section as they were rolling out their
[SPEAKER_07]: product throughout Canada because you
don't grow weed that you haven't sold yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's a very good rollout from
Canara with the gigantic facility that a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of other companies that were mentioned
before would try to just put in full blown
[SPEAKER_07]: activity like let's say a site in Edmonton
that was called Sky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah well there's many Canadian examples
of that but we won't get into that George
[SPEAKER_05]: some with some good examples.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah I've seen I've seen plenty of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean there was an outfit out in Las
Vegas called Shango.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I really appreciate about what they
did was they had a plan.
[SPEAKER_10]: They said this is where we're going to be
in one year two years three years four
[SPEAKER_10]: years five years.
[SPEAKER_10]: They stuck to their plan.
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a building that was too big for
what they needed but they didn't fill it
[SPEAKER_10]: up with other stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: They said OK this is going to be future
growth is going to be future growth.
[SPEAKER_10]: So really the only thing that they were
stuck on was real estate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't buy a bunch of extra
equipment.
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't buy a bunch of extra grow
rooms.
[SPEAKER_10]: They sold vertically within their own
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I also see it with some of the
big MSOs in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: as opposed to some of the stuff that we
saw in Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know the Air Liberty Cresco Cura Leaf.
[SPEAKER_10]: These are some they have they have a lot
of people that are looking at the cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: which is used to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the cannabis called before.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're big.
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot the name but they're huge.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know they're the cannabis they're
called the cannabis cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Acreage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Acreage holdings.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So but they you know they have good plans
and I always find that the people with the
[SPEAKER_10]: right plans with the good plans that
follow the plan.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know hey by the way you know look at
this bubble hasher.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know we want to do this other product
over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Follow the plan because if you're thinking
that you're going to do it there's already
[SPEAKER_10]: 12 other people out there thinking they're
going to do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: How much do you think that people are
going to buy.
[SPEAKER_10]: How many people are going to buy it guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know and know your audience.
[SPEAKER_10]: The other thing I see is you know people
that know who their buyers are because
[SPEAKER_10]: somebody said it earlier but you have you
know somebody goes out there and says yeah
[SPEAKER_10]: I grow a ton of month.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well where do you sell that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well we use half of it ourselves and then
we're we're going to export it to in
[SPEAKER_10]: Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like OK do you have a
distribution network set up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because not only have I heard that from
you I've heard that from the last 20
[SPEAKER_10]: people I've talked to everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's going to sell flour in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's going to sell flour in Malta.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody in.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you've really got to understand your
market of what you're going to sell
[SPEAKER_10]: because you might think you're going to
sell a ton a month and you're not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to use a quote to something you
said Mike Tyson.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to quote Mike Tyson to say everyone
has a plan until you get punched in the
[SPEAKER_05]: face.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anyone knows that line but
that actually works in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have a plan then you get punched in
the face by the regulations or something
[SPEAKER_05]: else or the bank or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then sometimes you got to pivot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But fair point.
[SPEAKER_05]: What else do you guys think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree 100 good examples.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree in terms of and my
introduction earlier I mentioned that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're laser focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like that I've actually experienced a
lot of different companies going oh it's
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's that let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they keep jumping all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think for me it's a bit different in
terms of what I see as success because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not looking at it from a how do we sell
flour or how do we manufacture stuff or
[SPEAKER_01]: how do we grow stuff because we're about
drug development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the companies that we look at in terms
of the ones that are exceptional are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: at scale are companies like GW Pharma that
have spent the time to invest in the
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical data and getting the results that
is required to get registrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then investing in that registration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course that worked out very well
for them as we all know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as soon as that one product was
registered they sold for seven point eight
[SPEAKER_01]: billion dollars to Jazz Pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from our point of view we have been
laser focused from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very much on that pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about what products what indication
and what can we realistically register.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the cannabis and general I
think that I would say to everyone here
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's very important of course cash
flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all need a bit of cash flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us for example at OMG we have two
divisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not selling anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to give you a bit of an
idea is to tell in terms of the strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is a division that we can
sell products over the counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't get into the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that early stage that allowed us early
stage revenue quite significant and enough
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can invest that money straight
into the clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means that as a company we're not
out looking for investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not scratching around trying to get
a dollar here or a dollar there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the budget when we started and
we're going down that pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any company that puts in the time and
the hard jazz and the money because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not for the faint hearted is about
gathering the evidence so that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: have a product that worldwide can be sold.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very good point.
Brian.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: To give you two examples.
[SPEAKER_09]: Both of these from the states camp
companies that were successful in scaling
[SPEAKER_09]: one brand called Wild W.
[SPEAKER_09]: Y.
[SPEAKER_09]: L.
[SPEAKER_09]: D.
[SPEAKER_09]: On the other called Wana W.
[SPEAKER_09]: A.
[SPEAKER_09]: N.
[SPEAKER_09]: A.
[SPEAKER_09]: Both gummies edibles brands.
[SPEAKER_09]: To me their success has been dictated by
two things.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've stayed very asset light where they
proved their model in one market and then
[SPEAKER_09]: took that model and licensed it to many
other markets and didn't go through all of
[SPEAKER_09]: the capital expenditures of building their
own facility in every individual market.
[SPEAKER_09]: They took their I.P.
[SPEAKER_09]: made sure that it was easily repeatable
and placed it wherever they could and
[SPEAKER_09]: managed the quality control through those
agreements.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can stay asset light it's going to
make scaling much easier because you won't
[SPEAKER_09]: need as much investment obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an excellent point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know one thing I've heard from all
four of you I think that's really
[SPEAKER_05]: important is the importance of being
focused but also having a business that
[SPEAKER_05]: funds your business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's nice to have big plans and
innovative and be a dreamer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean yeah we need that in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're always pushing the boundaries but
you also need a business like at Lush
[SPEAKER_05]: where you also do contract manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We make products for some of the biggest
companies in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't make a lot of money on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a volume thing but it keeps the
lights on so that we can actually have
[SPEAKER_05]: some of our own brands and and try to do
innovation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I heard that from all four of
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know much like in California which
people think is an awesome market.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go to L.A.
[SPEAKER_05]: and you're like wow this is the best
market I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you actually talk to the business
owners who own the businesses and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: dying.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not making money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said how is that possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones that survive are finding other
ways to make money which I won't say up
[SPEAKER_05]: here on the stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you got to find ways to make money to
fund your dreams and hopes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know as we're looking at funding
you know this is such an important part.
[SPEAKER_05]: And me and Brian were talking about this
before and a few of us backstage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to have these dreams but if no
one's funding these dreams they're just
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be dreams.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you think they're going to be
funded later like hey let's just get
[SPEAKER_05]: started and we'll find the funding later.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen many shuttered down facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking an example you were saying
the Canary example how they bought over a
[SPEAKER_05]: facility of a bankrupt company.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's a good strategy because that
other company didn't plan for funding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Brian if you want to start off you
have a lot of experience with this.
[SPEAKER_05]: How important is funding and what can you
what kind of advice can you give these
[SPEAKER_05]: people when it comes to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean something I like to say is that
funding is the fuel that that really
[SPEAKER_09]: lights the fire without it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have no fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your business goes goes out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one thing that I've seen in the
last two or three years the big difference
[SPEAKER_09]: from say five to ten years ago is that
everyone is focused tremendously on
[SPEAKER_09]: EBITDA.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we making money.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we make money.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so in order to illustrate that I
emphasize how the importance of having a
[SPEAKER_09]: business model a financial model that's on
paper that actually withstands practical
[SPEAKER_09]: experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: Years ago say 2012 to 2018 most models
were based on I mean hopes hopes and
[SPEAKER_09]: dreams that didn't come to fruition.
[SPEAKER_09]: Often the business model was showing a
relatively steady line of wholesale
[SPEAKER_09]: pricing for all of the product which as we
all understand supply and demand as that
[SPEAKER_09]: market saturates that price craters which
makes everything more difficult and makes
[SPEAKER_09]: the model now fail.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what the best way is to be able to show
that model can work with practical
[SPEAKER_09]: knowledge showing some commonalities
between markets.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every market is going to be independent
whether we're talking Germany or in other
[SPEAKER_09]: European countries.
[SPEAKER_09]: Canada or any other state in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: everything's going to be a little bit
different but they all follow a very
[SPEAKER_09]: similar path where prices are very high
early on and you can take that extra
[SPEAKER_09]: margin reinvest in your business like
we're saying if your business can't
[SPEAKER_09]: continue to fuel your business you will
again run out of run out of fuel.
[SPEAKER_09]: But really if we can just lost that train
of thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you said bless you in your mind I
also do that if I see I always say bless
[SPEAKER_05]: you but those are some really good points.
[SPEAKER_05]: George I know you I'm sure have some
thoughts on funding and investing like
[SPEAKER_05]: making sure you're well funded and John we
were talking backstage.
[SPEAKER_05]: How important is being well funded and
having the right investors in this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I don't know because I haven't got
any.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe what's your secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is be deliberate
deliberate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I believe just like you said if
you don't spend your grandchildren's
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is inheritance or if you're
not going to put your own money in then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're buggered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Scottish people tend to shove their own
money in make it work build it tweak it
[SPEAKER_01]: build value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can talk about investors
investor opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until there's value I wouldn't invest
in a company that I didn't see an end
[SPEAKER_01]: result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in actual fact my my desire was to
invest in a company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I wanted to do because of the
all of the stuff then I won't bore you
[SPEAKER_01]: with the details but by exciting market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But interestingly when I went and met
people all over the world it was
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderfully exciting their decks and their
positioning and they were going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: gazillions of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you start to ask them questions
or who are you selling it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like well anybody can buy it we'll
sell it to anybody you know if everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course we know this is medicine and
I'm talking about from a medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective so it's not as easy just to
sell stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were very deliberate not to go out
and and to raise funds until we actually
[SPEAKER_01]: gathered the evidence created and
developed our own products not
[SPEAKER_01]: white-labeled products and we actually
started selling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously we were six years in that
development stage and for the last years
[SPEAKER_01]: we've launched worldwide with our
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the going out and talking
about investment it's not something that
[SPEAKER_01]: we are actively looking at now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the group CEO is in the room somewhere
he's probably got a different perspective
[SPEAKER_01]: and in terms of the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: The CEO is usually the one that has to
worry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll be worried about that he's telling
me that he'll probably have a different
[SPEAKER_01]: view on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for us and for me I will only only
invest in something if I can see something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is going to give.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a bit of blue sky don't get me
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I need to see something what is it
that you're going to have if it's a CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: product then it has to be different from
any other CBD product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well if you can't make it different then
what viable product have you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you're going to generate revenue from
because if everybody's got a CBD product
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's CBD or THC what makes a
difference then we get into the price to
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us it's more important to build the
value so that investors will come.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to have to go out and start
spooking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to say look at what we have done
is this something that you feel a little
[SPEAKER_01]: value and with that resonate to your
investment strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can have a discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not with me because I can't talk about
money with anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can talk to the group CEO if they
have any interest in that product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure he would have a different
perspective of it and we were talking with
[SPEAKER_05]: Brian also around the importance of
complacency and not being complacent and
[SPEAKER_05]: how complacency can kill you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you're in a great position you're a
leader everyone's giving you money.
[SPEAKER_05]: You be careful because someone's coming
after that very quickly and you can
[SPEAKER_05]: change.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember I was here a few years ago and
someone asked a question what's the number
[SPEAKER_05]: one piece of advice you would give someone
to get for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like well it's a lot of pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have like literally one minute to answer
a question and I said be careful you get
[SPEAKER_05]: your money from.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you get investment don't just be
excited that someone wants to invest in
[SPEAKER_05]: your company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like someone might want to invest in your
company and that's going to destroy you
[SPEAKER_05]: because the wrong investor is going to
whip you and make you rush and all of a
[SPEAKER_05]: sudden you're tripping on yourself and
you're not executing your plan the way you
[SPEAKER_05]: thought you were and boom you've actually
lost your whole business because you took
[SPEAKER_05]: the wrong investor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Brian what do you think about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you have some thoughts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah I was just going to add that cannabis
is so unique and again market by market
[SPEAKER_09]: it's so unique that you need an investor
that has an open mind so that they're not
[SPEAKER_09]: forcing your hand.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are so many situations that come up
where a regulation changes or perhaps
[SPEAKER_09]: we're doing it this way in one market but
the regulations force us to do it that way
[SPEAKER_09]: in another.
[SPEAKER_09]: In a lot of scenarios an uninformed
investor the wrong investor doesn't fully
[SPEAKER_09]: understand the true length of time that
it's going to take to execute on that
[SPEAKER_09]: change or that idea and creates a false
pressure that then forces decisions that
[SPEAKER_09]: hinder the business long term.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or even worse if you have seen an investor
who gives you advice he invests and all of
[SPEAKER_05]: a sudden they start telling you how to run
your business.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen that before and it's like excuse
me if you know how to run the business
[SPEAKER_05]: you'd be running the business and not just
as an investor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've seen that before
but it's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well I wanted exactly a touch on that like
we were talking about getting funding but
[SPEAKER_07]: you exactly what you said you should watch
out who you get that money for.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should probably not have invested on
the board also that have divesting
[SPEAKER_07]: interests on what's actually happening
right.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you build a cannabis company it's not
easy money it's a lot of hard work scaling
[SPEAKER_07]: up takes a lot of time to be done
properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's very important to find the right
people to put on the bus before you're
[SPEAKER_07]: actually driving that bus.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one thing that we've learned is you
know to get the 40 investor to start a
[SPEAKER_07]: business is to get the right people on
board before you drive the bus and get it
[SPEAKER_07]: to the right place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody needs to be aligned so don't
just rush into getting money.
[SPEAKER_10]: And just from a perspective of seeing a
bunch of different scenarios you know you
[SPEAKER_10]: got to really understand your investor and
their motivation.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the key thing is their motivation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they are they there to make money.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes but are they going to make money in
the short term or the long term.
[SPEAKER_10]: And how much are they how much are they
going to try to influence you to change
[SPEAKER_10]: your plan and how much.
[SPEAKER_10]: How much influence do they have over your
plan.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you just got to be careful investors
because if you don't play it right.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to be up.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to end up being claim file.
[SPEAKER_05]: And further is going to be riding the bus.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like he's going to hijack the bus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just invited him on a seat on the bus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next thing you know he's kicking you out
and you're driving your bus to use that
[SPEAKER_05]: analogy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're going to open up to questions in
one moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully some people have some
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see some people looking over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: One last couple of quick bullet thoughts
on international money.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of the markets that either
you're scaling to currently or that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: hopeful for to scale to one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I met someone earlier that's waiting for
Mexico to open up and he's like Mexico is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be so huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like I keep waiting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah maybe one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe something a little closer that's
that's actually happening faster or that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any thoughts on countries.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll kick it off with Thailand seeing
Thailand really explode.
[SPEAKER_09]: Something I've been learning about in the
last couple of days is just exponentially
[SPEAKER_09]: that the growth that we're seeing there
that excites me because it seems to be a
[SPEAKER_09]: an interesting market to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well we should talk about that because
they've exploded and then imploded.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's a story for a different panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we can talk about that after.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: But so I've met probably a dozen people
who I said oh yeah we're going to grow in
[SPEAKER_10]: our country and we're going to send it to
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yet you know and more than there's
more than a dozen.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just being facetious.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yet the Thailand you know you don't
know if Thailand comes back and says hey
[SPEAKER_10]: look we're going to buy flour from within
our own country first.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now what is that person who's just said oh
I'm going to grow this whole truck full
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm going to send it to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't even have a lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend Atiyah is setting up a
laboratory there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no laboratory.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would you send weed to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thailand can grow weed for a nickel a
gram.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: A true nickel bag.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't want your weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I need that sound bite to play like 12
times a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next time someone says that to you just be
like hold on go talk to that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be honest about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah it's like that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to open up to a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: No no no no it's OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see some people with questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you did.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know these people paid a lot of money
to come to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did.
[SPEAKER_02]: They paid a lot of money to ask a
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So who's got a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see some hands over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: He only takes questions beside him by the
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you actually have to like go close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Considering customer confidence quality
and service which would you say is the
[SPEAKER_03]: most important and why when building a
successful brand or company.
[SPEAKER_05]: What were they again.
[SPEAKER_05]: The three things again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Customer service quality customer
confidence quality and service which would
[SPEAKER_03]: be the most important and why when you're
attempting to build a successful brand or
[SPEAKER_03]: company.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would go with cost customer confidence.
[SPEAKER_07]: So establishing a brand in campus is
extremely hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: All that American way of pumping a lot of
money and marketing does not work in
[SPEAKER_07]: campus.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're only one lot away from losing all
your clients in the sense that it's a
[SPEAKER_07]: recession.
[SPEAKER_07]: People want something that every time they
pay for it it's going to be the same
[SPEAKER_07]: effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be what they paid for.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be one batch at 20
percent the other batch at 28.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm really talking dry flour right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not on the farmer's side.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is customer confidence for us to
build a brand recognition.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had to be the number one selling sativa
for the last four years before it actually
[SPEAKER_07]: started to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is absolutely no brand loyalty as
there shouldn't be at the beginning of an
[SPEAKER_07]: industry because we saw how that went
through.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no celebrity brand in Canada that
actually did good.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Snoop Dogg weed was terrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that you need to understand you cannot
sell weed with a lie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Consumers will not be tricked.
[SPEAKER_07]: So gaining their confidence that every
time they go to that store and they buy
[SPEAKER_07]: that pouch or that bottle it's the weed
that they want and it's going to be the
[SPEAKER_07]: same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same thing time and time again within a
very reasonable cannabinoid range is the
[SPEAKER_07]: hardest you can do by growing a life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't go telling the booth out there
who has the Snoop brand that someone on
[SPEAKER_05]: the panel said that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't mention that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Celebrity thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with his answer with everything
else comes from consumer confidence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well quality customer everything else
gives confidence is there.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the rest falls in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brian what do you think?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just going to say quality above all else.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean the consumer confidence.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean if you can't produce a quality
product time and again it's over.
[SPEAKER_09]: Consistency and standardization.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the key with those words.
[SPEAKER_05]: Question over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have partners in growing in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of advice and what do you think
would be the future of growing in Colombia
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually exporting medical to Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Question number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we finally opened up in Germany
on social clubs starting July 1st in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to apply for the growing license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice in our personal interest as
well that we now want to start a kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: social club in Berlin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can just quickly start off by saying we
need to stop calling them social clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a panel yesterday at 11.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing social about these social
clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were joking they're called anti-social
social clubs because they actually do not
[SPEAKER_05]: allow you to consume.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really more like grow clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah the advice you should have been
to my panel yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Colombia quick thought they're
actually finally doing something
[SPEAKER_05]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I saw the number.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they did about 11 million dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took many many years to get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think they're finally doing
something impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they can get you GMP certified product
and there's a few that do it and they
[SPEAKER_05]: realize that their stuff is going to
demand a lower price point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's an opportunity there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've got clients in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got units in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing about Colombia is the stigma.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know the history.
[SPEAKER_10]: The culture.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know Colombia could really break out
by exploiting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey you know we this is the jungle grown.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the this is this is from the
mother earth.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know this is this is what's been
around for years and years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah the rainforest everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean so it's I think it's a lot of
branding and bringing something different
[SPEAKER_10]: to the table.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's something that that you
know Thailand you know Australia all these
[SPEAKER_10]: places.
[SPEAKER_10]: Germany you know it's funny because people
want to export everywhere and everything
[SPEAKER_10]: you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know it's they're they're making
the same strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like Colombian coffee where do you
get a load of Colombian cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_05]: The smart man's eight ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the C letters I notice.
[SPEAKER_05]: The letter C.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you really have a good opportunity in
Colombia especially you know the clients I
[SPEAKER_10]: have down there is to is to really like
Humboldt County in California.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know you know they've got the brand
there because hey we are where they got
[SPEAKER_10]: the OG's of weed in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: Colombia's the OG of weed in the world you
know so.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would answer to the social club.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to really going to have to
build a very strong business model to be
[SPEAKER_09]: able to design that operation and design
that facility to execute on that mainly
[SPEAKER_09]: because of your not for profit requirement
at least for now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll want to make sure that the money
that you have we put it to the best use
[SPEAKER_09]: possible to be able to produce
consistently for your members so that you
[SPEAKER_09]: don't risk them jumping to another club
because the way I see it is you're going
[SPEAKER_09]: to want to retain those members forever so
that you can keep that revenue from them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's going to be a way to design
and build that facility to be able to keep
[SPEAKER_09]: it as as operationally efficient and keep
your costs low so that you can provide
[SPEAKER_09]: really cost effective product to your
members to keep them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Alex you're a super quick point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the cannabis clubs for me I think
it's a legalization that's kind of broken.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to change for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: The reality of the fact is you know I
explained greenhouse weed and outdoor weed
[SPEAKER_07]: is not consistent.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not necessarily going to meet
regulations not necessarily be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: build a brand on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The reality of the fact is Germany does
not have the power grid to supply indoor
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not possible with the power you
guys have.
[SPEAKER_07]: We barely have enough and we're the number
one supplier right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's going to happen is once you
can't meet the demand of proper cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: you're going to promote the black market
if you don't help it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I will build build a very small
facility 300 kg can be ran by 200 meter of
[SPEAKER_07]: canopy flowering space right and gear up
to bring in imports.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course the imports are going to come in
because you're going to need to supply all
[SPEAKER_07]: that demand.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like honestly guys there's at least 200
tons of consumption probably in Germany
[SPEAKER_07]: alone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quebec is 300 tons per year with the black
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: But by the way Poland has the lowest cost
of electricity in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if there's any Polish
people here but I think you have an
[SPEAKER_05]: advantage sorry go ahead question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So say someone would have a relatively
successful business that they built from
[SPEAKER_06]: from nothing but they think that they
probably need some advice to get it beyond
[SPEAKER_06]: that point and they're thinking maybe of
an advisory board like what would be some
[SPEAKER_06]: of the maybe unwritten rules of engaging
someone to say hey would you be maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: interested in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well first of all I think advisory boards
are one of the most important things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a huge fan of advisory boards.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sit on a few and always recommend that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean to give you tips I think there's a
long conversation or if anyone wants to
[SPEAKER_05]: throw a few tips but you're welcome to
come see us after.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to kind of give you some
thoughts on that like a 40 minute keynote
[SPEAKER_05]: on advisory boards.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah just carefully because I know you're
a consultant but he's a well established
[SPEAKER_10]: consultant.
[SPEAKER_10]: So ask around.
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to be a consultant not in this
space but years ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ask around.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ask for if you're going to go the
consultant route.
[SPEAKER_10]: Having consultants give you input and help
you helping you to steer decisions is very
[SPEAKER_10]: good but ask around.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make sure that they have.
[SPEAKER_10]: I met somebody yesterday was a car
salesman like a year ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know you actually just remind me last
year someone asked me about about the
[SPEAKER_05]: importance of advisors and what I told
them is make sure your consultant your
[SPEAKER_05]: advisor actually has done it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many people are consultants and
advisors who have never actually done
[SPEAKER_05]: those things they're consulting and
advising on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like make sure they've actually
successfully done it.
[SPEAKER_05]: People like oh I've done this this this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that successful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no this is the reason it wasn't
successful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like okay I don't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any successes.
No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wrong person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
Next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nima Vesa here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pivot off of what Alex said earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alex or Alex.
[SPEAKER_05]: The French one or the Canadian one.
[SPEAKER_04]: The middle name is Alex.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love to hear any answer anyone here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned something very quickly which
is try to convince your investor or enable
[SPEAKER_04]: like not have them on your board.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the biggest things I always
see any time you're taking money.
[SPEAKER_04]: They almost always want at least a board
seat.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you how have you ever seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Successfully convinced an investor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most investors actually want to have a
seat on the board.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you said don't let them have a seat
on the board I was going to say that's a
[SPEAKER_05]: very hard thing to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Real investors are like they don't trust
anyone and they want to sit on the board.
[SPEAKER_10]: But isn't there a percentage you know like
hey look if they're going to throw 40
[SPEAKER_10]: percent in.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know but if they're going to put in
here's here's two grand.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see it on your board.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take a hike guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we mean by choose your
money carefully.
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone's going to be giving you that
much money and be sitting on the board you
[SPEAKER_07]: want that person to have the proper
qualification and share the passion and
[SPEAKER_07]: the value.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I say we build a cannabis business
and we do one point five million dividend
[SPEAKER_07]: in 18 months.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's the vision forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be hard for us to scale up.
[SPEAKER_07]: At some point we can't be paying gigantic
dividend and scaling up at the same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where division needs to be
understood.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know also do you want to build a
business that's going to be a legacy
[SPEAKER_07]: that's going to live on after you're done
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever heard of an instance where
an investor was like I don't need the
[SPEAKER_04]: board seat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately I'm not the most well
versed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know my professional career is mostly
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before that I didn't really go to school.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not the best one to answer that
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I will point out I think it's OK for
them to have a seat.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as long as it's a seat and nothing
more than that I think it's all around
[SPEAKER_05]: majority.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boards made up of five people seven
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as there's less of investors
versus actual business people on there I
[SPEAKER_05]: think you're OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: But having a seat at the table I think is
OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they know what's going on and they feel
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hey sometimes you actually need more
money from those investors.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the easiest people to get more
money from.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they know what's going on and they
feel comfortable they're the most likely
[SPEAKER_05]: to re up and add more money which is kind
of what's that percentage.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's that percentage where you go back
to somebody who wants to invest and you
[SPEAKER_10]: say well if you give 20 percent or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the percentage to get them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think 20 percent if you have anything
less than 20 percent you can't even ask
[SPEAKER_05]: them for a board seat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you have at least 20 percent
invested you can actually request.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're like five percent I don't
know unless you're awesome and they really
[SPEAKER_05]: like you sometimes people.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually a quick point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having a strategic investor sometimes it's
not even about the money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly I just might sound crazy to say
at a business conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: The money is not the hard part.
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear to you if you have a really good
business and you have really talented
[SPEAKER_05]: people lots of people will give you money.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about taking the smart money and
having strategic investors that will do
[SPEAKER_05]: more for you than just give you money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Banks will give you money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well not if you're in cannabis but
anyways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: No they could.
[SPEAKER_05]: And internationally we'll see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know this is the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah it's really awesome.

Jesse and Noel and all the awesome people
