[SPEAKER_04]: I will introduce the moderator,
and he'll take it from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is a horticultural scientist,
court-certified expert, and a teacher,
[SPEAKER_04]: and he serves as the director of CAN
Research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please give a warm welcome for Mr. Todd
Delato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so cannabis testing for quality
control, for safety, for potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: has been an integral part of Oregon,
as well as just about every other state's
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon did some of the earliest work on
developing testing requirements and such,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's been a long, long process of
changing and adapting to the needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: assure quality and safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's been an issue that's been very
intimate to myself, and we've got three
[SPEAKER_00]: panelists here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing goes a lot more beyond testing
labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Oregon farmers, farmers are
basically, the whole industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: downstream from the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got a farmer, Tom Lowerman,
here to start, to tell us about the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some of the cultivation aspects
of quality control and how that eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: goes downstream to the testing labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Matt Ochoa from Jefferson
Packaging, and he takes, his business is
[SPEAKER_00]: taking things from the grower to the
retailer, providing harvest services,
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and curing, and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have Wesley McGuire from Pixis
Labs, and he's an expert in analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry in one of the biggest labs in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which actually goes back many years as an
agricultural lab, way before they started
[SPEAKER_00]: testing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna give each of them a few
minutes to tell us about their perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: on cultivation and testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm gonna ask the panel a few
questions, and then we'll open it up to
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys to ask questions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about we start with farmer Tom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as cultivation goes, and
pesticides, everybody wants to be organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've really gotta know what your
neighbors are doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of blow over is causing problems in
the testing realm.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, in America, we're pretty more
reactive than preventative as far as
[SPEAKER_05]: testing goes on all aspects.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can start in the food industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Japan, it's zero parts per million of
any kind of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in South Korea, it's three parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Europe, it's five parts per million.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the United States, it's 5,000 parts
per million.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really have become a reactive
country where it favors the growers and
[SPEAKER_05]: the processors and not so much the
consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we think we really need to change that
in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are change of laws around the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Washington state, a couple years ago,
they were having 30% failures due to mold.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what happened was one of the lobby
groups came in, they lobbied them,
[SPEAKER_05]: and now they have 0% failure rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means that there's mold out there
in the system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what usually happens in America is a
group of people will get sick,
[SPEAKER_05]: and what they'll do is they'll go after
the processor and that grower and not
[SPEAKER_05]: really deal with the bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the 5,000 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of any kind of fecal bacteria,
any kind of bacteria in the end product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really need to be more proactive
than reactive, and I think that's a great
[SPEAKER_05]: place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, and Matt Ochoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, my name is Matt Ochoa, and Jefferson
Packing House is my company.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a fairly unique position in the
market in that we work with a lot of farms
[SPEAKER_06]: in the area.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're down in southern Oregon where a lot
of our product comes from, and I think 70%
[SPEAKER_06]: of the producer licenses are within 70
miles of our warehouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we see is kind of the results of
everybody's idea of how to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_06]: We as an industry, for the last 30,
40 years, the thing was to be in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, everybody was in their own
little silo doing what they thought best,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it was really important to not
communicate with other people about what
[SPEAKER_06]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a big transition in the culture
of the market to have it all be out in the
[SPEAKER_06]: open and all be tested and seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, it's going from
everybody's personal view to what's
[SPEAKER_06]: actually working.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a lot of what we're sharing with
people is just the results side.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're seeing that now it's all about unit
cost.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it used to be just produce as
much as you could, and as much as you
[SPEAKER_06]: could produce would be gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's really about, like,
cash flow is super important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, are you laying out too much cash for
what this market constricted in Oregon can
[SPEAKER_06]: actually get back to you?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, like, as a result, a big focus of
our model is helping people with
[SPEAKER_06]: efficiency and helping people see what
really works.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, in one way, it's really
awesome to see it all coming through.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome to see the legal market
happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a really painful market right now
for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are tons of high hopes and dreams.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody thought they had the secret to
success here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that might be more true when there's
more opportunity for sales.
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now you have to really be a
tight operator to function in this market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah, I mean, I think the industry,
I was in it since a kid, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: pain and difficulty was always a big part
of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as we're going through this
transition, we're seeing a lot of the
[SPEAKER_06]: newcomers fall back off because they're
expecting it to be something it's not.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not, you know, I got a message from a
farmer straight up saying, like,
[SPEAKER_06]: can I take over his farm because he
thought it was going to be like hanging
[SPEAKER_06]: out on his tractor and going fishing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it was never that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, everybody I always knew as a
producer was working hard making a living.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was kind of always in the same
position as a wholesaler.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we got a ways to go before
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This makes it through.
[SPEAKER_06]: And on one side, it's really beautiful to
see the community that arises out of
[SPEAKER_06]: difficulty.
[SPEAKER_06]: People come together and people drop a lot
of their resistance to, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: sharing what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the beautiful side of it is that
people are supporting each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know my company wouldn't be here
without a ton of grace from last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, we had a ton of understanding and
patience with us while we went through our
[SPEAKER_06]: growing pains.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really appreciate that part.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's part of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm glad to be a part of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Wesley McGuire, I want you to tell us a
little bit about the analytical chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been an analytical chemist for
about 10 years doing testing in food and
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental and agricultural fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing about being involved
in cannabis here in Oregon is I was just
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking to a colleague outside before we
came in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first time that I have been
involved in a testing market where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: required to test for all of these
parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis growers and producers are
required to test for potency, for
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides, for residual solvents in their
extracts and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I think this is really good,
I think that there are times when it puts
[SPEAKER_01]: an inordinate amount of pressure on small
cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't advocate for that to be
changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a comparison, if you look at the
food industry, nationally, FDA sets
[SPEAKER_01]: standards or rather EPA sets tolerances
for what residues are allowed on crops and
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA enforces them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's required to do that testing,
but anyone could be liable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that creates a pressure that pushes
testing in the interest of not only
[SPEAKER_01]: self-preservation for those companies,
but in the interest of public health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely want to give props to
Farmer Tom for bringing up that public
[SPEAKER_01]: health aspect because it's an important
passion of mine, which is that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that we should really be focusing our
regulatory and our testing efforts on
[SPEAKER_01]: things which could present a health threat
to the consumers of this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the interesting thing about cannabis,
different from other consumables,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that many cannabis users are medical
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not simply a consumable that
people are using recreationally,
[SPEAKER_01]: although that has definitely driven a lot
of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people with sometimes compromised
immune systems, they may be cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: patients undergoing chemotherapy using
cannabis products to help medicate their
[SPEAKER_01]: nausea.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be people suffering HIV AIDS
and using cannabis because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-inflammatory benefits and the
benefits that they see for their immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system response or to counteract the
effects of harsh medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are people that really cannot brook
additional threats to their health in the
[SPEAKER_01]: form of toxic residues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think in some ways that Oregon
has set themselves up to go above and
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond what other industries do require
for testing, but in some ways we also have
[SPEAKER_01]: a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oregon, in particular, we have a list
of 59 pesticides that we test for
[SPEAKER_01]: residues, and they were selected based on
known use and based on potential health
[SPEAKER_01]: effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, there are 1,000
pesticide products available out there and
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And routine testing in the food world
often incorporates hundreds of pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: into the residue tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it begs the question, once we know that
there is a static list required for
[SPEAKER_01]: testing, are there, because of these
economic pressures in the Oregon market,
[SPEAKER_01]: are there unscrupulous growers or
producers out there that are using
[SPEAKER_01]: products that they know aren't being
tested for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done some research in this area and I
found the results kind of interesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the one thing that I would say is that
we have the capacity and the analytical
[SPEAKER_01]: capability to test for more residues and
to ensure that our product is cleaner and
[SPEAKER_01]: safer for consumers and patients alike.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to advocate for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to advocate for, even in the absence
of regulation, for us to go above and
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond and demonstrate that we are
providing a safe product, especially for
[SPEAKER_01]: people who may be using it medicinally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to ask the panel a few
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the meantime, why don't you guys
think of a few questions yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you'll have the opportunity to ask
them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with Farmer Tom, you know,
this last 10 years or so, we've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the largest scaling up of
cannabis grow, cannabis grow operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we started, you know,
maybe 10 years ago, a lot of people had,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 100 or 200 plants with people
going barefoot, making love to every
[SPEAKER_00]: single plant, not wearing rubber gloves or
hair nets or even lab testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're building multimillion dollar
facilities, you know, with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: standard operating procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so can you tell us a little bit about
some aspects of scaling up that's
[SPEAKER_00]: important for growers to pay attention to
that that we may not have realized from
[SPEAKER_00]: the way we did things 10 years ago?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's so much recording that needs
to go on for the LCC and the different,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, government agencies that that
takes up a huge amount of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's the taxes that they have
to worry about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's the employee and the
employee unemployment and all these
[SPEAKER_05]: different taxes and regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the small farm has really been
burdened with a ton of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And look, these guys are most of us,
we're just good guys who love the earth
[SPEAKER_05]: and who love to grow good cannabis and
have a good product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So much of us really don't know anything
about about scaling up, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: right now we're in a corporate world and
the mom and pop small farmers are going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be falling off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, like they said,
they're going to lose 80 to 90 percent of
[SPEAKER_05]: them here in the state of Oregon,
you know, over the next few years.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's why they're working on
out of state commerce and these types of
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll help.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, as far as the small farmer
goes and scaling up, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you really can't do things like you did in
your closet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really need somebody there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need a bunch of different extra people
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need somebody who's going to do
inventory control and take care of all the
[SPEAKER_05]: tagging of all the plants and all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they really need a large workforce and
it's really super hard for them right now
[SPEAKER_05]: since the price is driven down so low.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of farmers are paying their
employees out of their pockets and they
[SPEAKER_05]: can only do that so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: So scaling up, you know, start off with
what you know you can sell and just
[SPEAKER_05]: continue down that road.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in the end of the day here in
Oregon and in California, it's not going
[SPEAKER_05]: to be so much the small farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have a handful of craft
organic farmers throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be, you know, in Eugene,
you know, and then down in southern
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And kind of what I suggest is,
you know, we need historical centers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need some young guy to go out there and
document the last 40 years of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: growth in these areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I see, you know, because content
is king.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we get somebody out there documenting
all these video, documenting all these,
[SPEAKER_05]: have a place where people can land,
broadcast it wide over social media across
[SPEAKER_05]: the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you've got a place for people to land
and to come and visit the historical
[SPEAKER_05]: centers of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here in Oregon and California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's the way it's going to
go because all we have to do is look at
[SPEAKER_05]: the cut flower industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It used to go from here, the Willamette
Valley all the way to Mexico, the Tijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: border.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're not here anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all went to Columbia, Bolivia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can guarantee that's where
cannabis cultivation is going.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only going to be here in the states
until they open it up internationally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the whole ball has changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The game has changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a whole different world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're right in that position now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where we see big money coming in from
Canada, the corporate world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's getting excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing a lot of buyouts in
California of small companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of these companies will do
pretty good at selling for $5 or $10
[SPEAKER_05]: million.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they'll be able to retire.
[SPEAKER_05]: But their dream of, you know, being a
national brand and taking their product
[SPEAKER_05]: all the way is going to be a lot more
difficult path.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my suggestion to Oregon and California
is to create this historical center,
[SPEAKER_05]: have tourism wrapped around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Learn about all the OGs who paved the way
so we could all be in this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring them out of the darkness and into
the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Document it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Create a historical place where people
around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've spent a lot of time in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these Europeans will eat this stuff
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will travel from all over the world
to go to Williams or to go to Eugene and
[SPEAKER_05]: to learn about the history of cannabis and
how we all got here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be a tough path for all
you small farmers out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I say, diverse yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Build a good brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's tough for a farmer because a
farmer's job is 365 days a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there usually aren't days off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you really don't have that much time
to go out and do branding and marketing
[SPEAKER_05]: and all the other things that go along
with creating a really strong brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can do it alone, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really love the California model.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've all grouped up into collective
gardens for these little micro regions
[SPEAKER_05]: down there, the terroirs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see that being a huge benefit to
California because they're able to keep
[SPEAKER_05]: the small farmers in the play,
funnel it through one processing facility,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then it goes out on one brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the Humboldt Sungrowers Guild.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got true Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got 250 farms that feed this
machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were able to keep the state
plenty in good Humboldt cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So too bad Washington and Oregon and
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't really think too far ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of the Wild West out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all individuals pulling themselves
up by their bootstraps, that kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Tom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses like yours serve a lot of
different producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one issue that comes up is
cross-contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe client A, you process something for
client A, has some residual contaminants
[SPEAKER_00]: on it, can affect client B unless you have
the protocols to mitigate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you just tell us real briefly just
some of the protocols that are necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: for preventing cross-contamination?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Going into the business model,
we had a lot of fear around that.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people asked those same
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if some mold comes in on one plant,
is that going to spread everywhere else?
[SPEAKER_06]: The infrastructure and systems in place
have a lot to do with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of your mold and everything grows in
the right conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our system is to control the
temperature, keep a lot of airflow up.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the main things that I see is just
overcrowding of product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so one of the big things we did is
leave a lot of extra space in our
[SPEAKER_06]: warehouse, which gives access to
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can monitor everything,
see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we really didn't have the issues
everybody was afraid of.
[SPEAKER_06]: We never had mold go nuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, you have to clean up your
equipment between jobs.
[SPEAKER_06]: You always want to do that anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Aside from just keeping things clean and
tidy and making sure that more and more
[SPEAKER_06]: are on top of it is always taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we open things up to the audience,
I hope you're thinking of some good
[SPEAKER_00]: questions for our panelists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wesley, is there any aspects of testing
that are often overlooked in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: or that you would like to see either
voluntary testing or required?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the US, cannabis testing
regulations vary quite a bit state to
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there are states which have copied
the regulations that other states have put
[SPEAKER_01]: into place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think everyone is striving to reach
a best practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there are some holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them I mentioned a little bit
earlier, which is I think that our scheme
[SPEAKER_01]: for pesticide testing is nowhere near
expansive enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly, as Farmer Tom mentioned,
everybody wants to be organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the cannabis world, we would love to
believe that our product that we produce
[SPEAKER_01]: or consume is clean and healthy and
natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the only way to know that is to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we do organic testing on other
commodities, we do much more expansive
[SPEAKER_01]: testing than what's currently required.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to see whether it's driven
by regulation or by the industry leaders
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to demonstrate that their products
are cleaner than the competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see expanded testing in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the same vein, Oregon does not have any
requirements for testing of mycotoxins,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are the toxic metabolites left
behind by certain mold and fungus species.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, I don't think that the
states that are doing mycotoxins testing
[SPEAKER_01]: are looking at the right mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that may be a discussion that's a
little bit longer than we have time for
[SPEAKER_01]: here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think mycotoxins testing is
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think that heavy metals testing is
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis and hemp are known
bioremediators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bioaccumulate all sorts of things
from the soil that they're grown in and
[SPEAKER_01]: from their environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And heavy metals testing, I think,
is an area of concern that we should be
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly with all of these things,
when you take a plant and you concentrate
[SPEAKER_01]: it into an extract, all of these
potentially toxic elements come along with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since we're using this stuff frequently
for recreation and as well as for
[SPEAKER_01]: medicating ourselves, I think we owe it to
ourselves and to the consumers and
[SPEAKER_01]: patients to make sure that it's as safe as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a horticulture... We're starting to
run out a little bit of time if you want
[SPEAKER_04]: to take questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, we're right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as a horticultural scientist,
I also have a great desire to see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf nutrient analysis, soil nutrient
analysis, microbial biomass and such,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to throw it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, yeah, it's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys got some good questions
for our panelists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Gaio's got the mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for the panel one more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, you guys are so thorough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's so stumped.
[SPEAKER_02]: And full of ice cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a question over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here it comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, thank you all for your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the question might be directed
at Wesley.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate your comments on expanding
the pesticide list and maybe looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: additional contaminants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any ways that you would see
that... I guess what would the cost
[SPEAKER_03]: implications be on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the batch size of 15 pounds in
Oregon, a 50 pound batch in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: would representative sampling allow us to
maybe enlarge the batch size and then be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to have additional analytes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are there other ways that you would...
Anybody on the panel see as a creative way
[SPEAKER_03]: to expand the testing, but also keep the
cost the same or reduce it by either
[SPEAKER_03]: expanding the batch, removing a duplicate,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that's a really relevant
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as both Matt and Tom touched on,
because of the way the market in Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: has developed, it puts a lot of pressure
on growers, particularly small growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to be profitable and to try to stay
in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more testing that we do... Testing
is not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the pricing of testing is being
driven down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, there is a certain
level of expertise, expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: instrumentation and facilities that need
to be maintained.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a point past which labs can't
lower their prices any further.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that you may be on the right
track in terms of lot size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the 15 pound lot makes sense from
a perspective of a small batch grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not from the perspective of industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure what the right approach is
from a regulatory side to limit that cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I do know that the better testing
services are available for those who want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be conscientious about the safety of
their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if you build a good
relationship with a laboratory,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can do a lot to work with you on
pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a whole lot of control over
the regulations that specify how much of
[SPEAKER_01]: each lot needs to be tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if you compare cannabis to
other industries, that 15 pound lot size
[SPEAKER_01]: may need to be reconsidered.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also think that the state tax system
should pick up part of the testing bill
[SPEAKER_05]: for sure because you really can't pour all
of this responsibility onto the farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that they should be using the tax
dollars that they generate to help
[SPEAKER_05]: subsidize the testing that's needed to
keep the public safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really quickly to add to that,
I would say again in comparison to food,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not just the growers that are
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Distributors test, retailers test,
and ultimately the job of policing and
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcing potentially toxic residues is on
the regulatory agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what Farmer Tom is saying is not
without merit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want in Oregon or elsewhere to know
that we are distributing clean product,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon should bear some responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: One last question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is about laboratory testing
and how there is a lack of oversight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe this Cannabis Commission in
Oregon is talking about creating a
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory that would oversee the oral
labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you guys feel about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like there's a real need for
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely feel like there is a need for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish that we had more than a minute
and a half to talk about it because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something I'm very passionate about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a number of laboratories in
Oregon that were basically built entirely
[SPEAKER_01]: to service the cannabis industry in the
last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: My lab is not one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing food and environmental
testing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that makes it really
hard for labs like that to compete is that
[SPEAKER_01]: they are dependent on cannabis business in
order to keep their doors open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that means is that when they are
pressured by sometimes big and lucrative
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis business to deliver the numbers
that seem favorable, they may be required
[SPEAKER_01]: to fold and bend to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that compromises our
scientific ethics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the only real solution for
that is oversight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Oral Lab is supposed to be delivering
that oversight for Oregon's cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratories, but they're spread way too
thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the results of this is that
laboratories are unfairly pressured to
[SPEAKER_01]: compete on potency numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is an ongoing issue in Oregon
with pretty rampant potency fraud since
[SPEAKER_01]: those THC numbers do drive sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think education of all levels of the
market of the industry is going to help
[SPEAKER_01]: with that, educating consumers,
educating business owners, even educating
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But oversight of the laboratories and
making sure that we're committed to
[SPEAKER_01]: quality data systems is absolutely
essential for all of us to keep doing what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing and delivering safe and
healthy products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for being a great
audience with great questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank our panelists for sharing with
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget to get up and breathe and
stretch a little bit or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see healthy people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, when it comes to quality
control and prevention, an ounce of
[SPEAKER_00]: prevention grows a pound to cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more time for the panel and the
panelists.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
