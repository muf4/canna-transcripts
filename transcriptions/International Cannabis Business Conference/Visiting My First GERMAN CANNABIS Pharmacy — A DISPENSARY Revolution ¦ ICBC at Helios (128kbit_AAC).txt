[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, what's up ICBC family?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in for a real treat today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm in for a treat because I'm at
my first German cannabis pharmacy that
[SPEAKER_00]: specializes in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with Manu and Leo here and they have
created something amazing right in the
[SPEAKER_00]: heart of Munich at Helios Pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you both could just really introduce
yourselves really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manu, what do you do here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Manu.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the CEO and co-founder of Helios
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the brain behind the cannabis section
and the cannabis concept for the store
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long has the store been open right in
the heart of Munich?
[SPEAKER_00]: We opened the store the 19th of February I
guess this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks so much for giving us the tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that was really interesting to
me is that it reminded me of Harborside
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispensary back in Oakland like about 15
years ago because you've separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a separate area for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I know that you're one of the
first people if not the first to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: do that and if not the only ones to do it
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course that reminds me of a dope
Harborside was the dopest California
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did you come up with that concept?
[SPEAKER_02]: This concept has their rulings when I
joined Oxford University back in 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: You went to Oxford?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I was an alumni at Oxford.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big up Oxford.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to Dale and Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're willing to get some knowledge
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because you went to Oxford and you took
their classes on dispensaries you were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to then incorporate that into the
pharmacy model for Germany and make it
[SPEAKER_00]: more efficient than it would be if you
were just normally you go to the counter
[SPEAKER_00]: and the same people go to the counter who
want cannabis or not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has to be a little bit cumbersome
or confusing at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure the cannabis patients need a
little more time for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started with cannabis with a normal
pharmacy a little bit outside of Munich
[SPEAKER_02]: and we had exactly this type of situations
that we always had problems when it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: those type of patients come together and
we decided that we need a secondary
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacy where we just focusing on the
distribution of cannabis and since I
[SPEAKER_02]: joined Oxford a few years ago that is
something I always wanted to bring up with
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm really glad that my business
partners are following my vision with that
[SPEAKER_02]: and put their heart also into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I do and bring cannabis to the people
and spread the law for cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_02]: special needs you can get out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving me fucking goosebumps right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the revolution in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really feels like something special is
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you guys are doing is cutting edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leo what do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Leo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm one of the pharmacy owners and the
second one is missing today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Stefan our senior partner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who founded the first pharmacy where we
started all the things back in 1996.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you do formulations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Also yeah not only but we're specialized
in doing formulations so it's not only the
[SPEAKER_03]: flower itself but we can do a lot of
different type of formulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do extractions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do mechanical separations with the
rosin that we get from there for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do other stuff like nanomagens.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do audio gels or kind of topicals
and all based on medical basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately two weeks ago you guys got
raided by the virus police and they came
[SPEAKER_00]: in and took your hash extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freeze dryer and all kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all because the washing system was too
heavy to wash it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they took it all because they said
that doing all that kind of formulation is
[SPEAKER_03]: against the current law cannabis law which
was implemented in April 1st of April this
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are a pharmacy so actually we have
the right to do all kind of formulations
[SPEAKER_03]: not only with cannabis but with all kind
of medical stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do cocaine eye drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do ketamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with much harder drugs you can do these
formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason they said you couldn't
do it with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The German law that was implemented in
April is split into two sections.
[SPEAKER_02]: One for the consuming part for normal
people that are private consumers that are
[SPEAKER_02]: home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the consuming part of the law and
then you have the medical part of the law
[SPEAKER_02]: where you get the wholesalers,
distributors, producers and pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they said you were going against some
consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean as a consumer if I'm at home
and I do any kind of extraction it's
[SPEAKER_03]: forbidden.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as we do it here we have the
prescription from a German physician.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which we had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which we had exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are in the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not the private space right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all we do here is something that we do
in the pharmacy and all kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: formulations that we do are medical
formulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't sound like you don't have to
be the world's greatest German lawyer to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like they're doing a little making
a statement maybe a little bit showing you
[SPEAKER_00]: know how they feel about it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: However as we know in the States when this
stuff happened before then this is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: time to obviously take it to court.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the law looks at it objectively it
sounds like you will win your case even
[SPEAKER_00]: though it's a lot of money and a big
hassle to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you boys could set a clear precedent
for Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you guys plan to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't give us another option because
they try to charge us with complete wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: law.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't say OK you did a you did a
mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when we don't say no against those
type of it is a fraud they try to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we don't do anything against this who
will it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to big up the Helios boys right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people are in this game
just to make some money you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fine if people want to get into
the game to make some money I'm not one to
[SPEAKER_00]: judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you find real cats at Helios
right here you know like Manu and Leo
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys are in the middle of the fight
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When everything's opened up these are the
guys setting new precedents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we have a saying once you
legalize that's when the fight really
[SPEAKER_00]: begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys are right in the middle of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
