[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd like to thank ICBC for inviting
me back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, being an economist, I didn't
bore the crowd too much last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I have two daughters and one
of the daughters refers to economics as
[SPEAKER_02]: not just economics, but boring economics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so hopefully today I won't endate you
with too many data points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my other daughter is going to
college next year and I asked her if she
[SPEAKER_02]: was going to study economics.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said, hell no.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my name is Beau Whitney.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the chief economist at Whitney
economics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're based out of Portland, Oregon on the
west coast of the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I'm going to talk about going to try
to provide an overview of the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: the US, Europe, and then dig into some
Spain data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, like I said, we're a global leader
in cannabis and hemp research and we
[SPEAKER_02]: provide data to governments, to operators,
to investors and the like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to talk specifically
about Spain as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some really interesting data out
of Spain these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just as an overview, and I know that
it's a friendly audience, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cannabis is really three
industries in one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the adult use, there's medical,
and then there's industrial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And industrial is also known as hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then within hemp, there's the
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three industries in one with hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, industrial are the cannabinoids
and fibers and grain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's lots of economic
opportunity in either of these sectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just important to choose one
and run with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of countries are viewing
cannabis reform favorably as a tool for
[SPEAKER_02]: economic development.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different for one country versus
another, but they're looking at this for
[SPEAKER_02]: job creation, for tax revenue,
for reductions in healthcare spending
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the health benefits of cannabis
as a proactive medicine and the like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lots of interest right now in cannabis
reform.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, and Giada touched upon this
earlier today, there's over 115 countries
[SPEAKER_02]: that have legalized access to cannabis in
some form or another from adult use,
[SPEAKER_02]: from medical, or even CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so various reform, you know,
entails different opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you combine hemp and adult use
and medical together, it's a trillion
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar market with a half a billion
consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lots of opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of opportunity out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, putting together total potential
market data, a lot of the analysts usually
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the UNODC numbers, the United
Nations data that looks at usage rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do these interviews country by
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes there's five years that separate
the surveys, you know, and the Congo from,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 2005 and then 2010 and maybe
2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of fits and starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I use the UN data as a baseline.
[SPEAKER_02]: I consider that the low end because it's
very conservative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I build my models based upon
other countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so I've developed a midpoint and
an upper bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I've got here on the right-hand
side on this side is how things break down
[SPEAKER_02]: from that legal perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So although there's legal revenue,
there's potential revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the medical countries where
there's legal access, those markets are
[SPEAKER_02]: huge and they're the largest opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you get in there and then things go
adult use, then there's huge upside
[SPEAKER_02]: potential in that market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so medical is by far the largest
opportunity, even outpacing illicit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I found that to be kind of
interesting when I was running this data.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've got about a half a billion
dollar market in the midpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so huge global potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I want to talk a little bit about the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in a bit of a state of disarray right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of murkiness about what the
policy should be, the federal
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's banking issues, there's taxation
issues, there's social equity issues,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's interstate commerce prohibitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you really have to look at the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: in discrete markets, state by state by
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's super fragmented.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the regulators at the state level and
at the federal level are really having
[SPEAKER_02]: difficulty managing the differences
between hemp and the policies related to
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp and managing the difference between
hemp and adult use and medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they first separated them and then
now they're trying to put them back
[SPEAKER_02]: together because they are looking at hemp
as cannabinoids and intoxicating rather
[SPEAKER_02]: than hemp in those three distinct markets
that I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a result of all of this murkiness,
this toggle between hemp and adult use,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's actually disincentivizing consumers
to participate in the legal markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, 11 states last year saw declines
in sales rather than increases in sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the level of growth was much less
than it has been before COVID and when the
[SPEAKER_02]: reform really started taking place during
the green rush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a business condition survey that I
published, a report that I published about
[SPEAKER_02]: a year ago said that 24% of cannabis
operators in the United States were
[SPEAKER_02]: profitable, 24%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means 76% were either breaking
even or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it talks about the health of the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just am on the cusp of
publishing a report on delinquent
[SPEAKER_02]: payments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically in the United States,
operators aren't paying other operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's an incentive because of the
high cost of capital, there's an incentive
[SPEAKER_02]: just not to pay each other because you can
finance that debt for free rather than
[SPEAKER_02]: going to a bank if you can get one and
paying 35% to 40% interest rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way that the system in the United
States works is that it incentivizes
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses not to pay each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this has never been published
before, but the amount of delinquent
[SPEAKER_02]: receivables in the United States at the
end of 2023 was $3.8 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's almost two months of revenue in
the entire legal market in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 1.6 months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a huge existential threat that
very few people are talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you don't pay each other,
then it's tough to pay your own bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough to pay your own debt service.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough to pay your taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to publish a report next
week on this with more details,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's kind of late breaking news.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a policy issue that needs to
be addressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And policymakers right now are so focused
on intoxicating hemp that they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: taking care of their own markets from
adult use and medical use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a lesson to be learned from
a medical regulatory perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is a lesson to be learned for
Europe because it's important that if you
[SPEAKER_02]: regulate a market, you should try to not
only regulate it and continue to stay on
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but also consider the health of the
operators that you're trying to regulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now there's a health issue
associated with the operators in adult use
[SPEAKER_02]: and medical in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we put together a forecast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a refresh forecast from last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually took down the 2024 forecast by
$3 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason that we took it down,
it's still showing growth, 9% growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just not the type of growth that you
would expect post-COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason we took it down is that
higher interest rates, there's inflation,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's just not enough money being
loaned out there in order to get
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses opened up and ramping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those ramps are kind of muted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're forecasting that this growth
rate will be lower than normal in 2024 and
[SPEAKER_02]: 2025, and it'll start accelerating in the
back half of 2025.
[SPEAKER_02]: So still pretty decent growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any industry would want 10% growth or 9%
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in cannabis in the United States is a
bit of a disappointment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the growth is going to come
not from the mature markets like Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: or Oregon or Washington, but will come
from new markets that have just deployed
[SPEAKER_02]: their program and it's starting to ramp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took down the, I just published a
global forecast as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the European market is like the second
largest market on the globe from a
[SPEAKER_02]: potential revenue perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fourth or fifth from a consumer
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the total addressable market's about
53 billion on the low end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Giada earlier today published 68 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was more in the middle of my
forecast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's an upper bound as well,
which could be in the hundreds of billions
[SPEAKER_02]: of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends upon which countries you
consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I take some of the statistics from
the World Bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they consider Russia as part of
Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they tend to bring up the numbers a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Germany is in focus right now because
of what's going on next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they continue to waffle back and
forth on their policy, there's a good
[SPEAKER_02]: chance that Spain and other countries
could start influencing the European
[SPEAKER_02]: reform movement more so than Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it just depends upon the timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when these large countries like the
United States or Germany tend to waffle,
[SPEAKER_02]: then it opens up opportunities for other
countries to take the lead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's very little data about the
European markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's getting better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're here to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you need any data or insights,
I'll have my contact information at the
[SPEAKER_02]: back half of this presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So five countries make up a majority of
the demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 53 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that's on the low end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Spain, you see in there,
is right around $5 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry I didn't put this in euros.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I speak in Berlin, I'll put that in
euros.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put these in euros.
[SPEAKER_02]: But $5 billion is a pretty decent market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for perspective, that's maybe the
size of some states in the United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: like New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still a pretty decent market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that's total market.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's illicit plus legal, or whatever you
really call legal here in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, based upon the UN numbers,
there's 3.3 million consumers of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reform is very popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the citizens want reform,
at least for medical, 84% based upon
[SPEAKER_02]: recent surveys.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there could be as many as seven or
eight million consumers in this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, right now, that's not being serviced
by the legal market, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all of this is illicit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the supply is coming in both
domestically and from Africa and from the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I have here is also the amount
of total consumption from an output
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So total amount of pounds of output that
you would need to satisfy all this demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's 824,000 kilos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's 824 tons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for perspective, this last year,
there was roughly 24 tons produced and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe 36 tons this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So only 4% of the total demand is being
produced from a supply perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when you talk about cannabis,
a lot of people talk about the demand,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they don't talk about supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: But supply is super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have enough, prices stay up
and consumers remain on the illicit
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have too much, then prices
collapse, which is great for consumer and
[SPEAKER_02]: participation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not good for the operators
because it compresses their margins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So striking a balance of supply versus
demand is super important in any market
[SPEAKER_02]: that you go into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Canada started this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The US followed suit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe may be right behind them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nobody seems to have learned from the
mistakes of other countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Canada, they oversupplied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prices crashed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually ended up destroying a lot of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were hoping to ship it to Europe,
and it didn't quite work out very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were hoping to ship it to the United
States, but they didn't legalize.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the United States, they are
overproducing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, there's more capacity legally
authorized in the United States than all
[SPEAKER_02]: of the consumers illicit and legal in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's already more capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this has the potential of crashing
prices, oversupplying markets,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then really hurting potential
opportunities for other people who want to
[SPEAKER_02]: enter into other states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I talked about industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just wanted to comment that even
with just a few sectors, automobile,
[SPEAKER_02]: construction, plastics, with a skosh of
cannabinoids in there, the hemp market is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually bigger than the adult use of
medical market globally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when people talk about cannabis,
there's a lot of influence there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be made by the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hemp may be the driver of cannabis
reform more so than a medical to adult use
[SPEAKER_02]: conversion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just wanted to talk about this now.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some countries, they view it all as
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in other countries, like in the
United States, they try to differentiate
[SPEAKER_02]: based upon THC content.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this differentiation can create
conflicts between the hemp industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: the marijuana industry, especially when it
comes to intoxicating cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that conflict, I think, is unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think hemp and marijuana can
coexist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they should, because it's all
basically the same plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, just like... And one of the
panelists, I think it was Jamie Pearson,
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned that the EU is similar to the US
in the fact that EU rules override
[SPEAKER_02]: countries, and then countries override
their states or provinces or what have
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same thing applies in United States
from a federal to state to county to city
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of the countries in the EU are
defaulting to the EU policy and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not challenging it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there is a rule that says,
if it's legal in one country and it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: for medical purposes, then it's legal to
be sold in all countries in the EU.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's an interesting concept that
is worth exploring, because it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's somebody from Portugal
here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you produce in Portugal and then you
can ship into Germany or ship into other
[SPEAKER_02]: markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so it's the concept that... Right,
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's nuances to it, but the concept
is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the principle of shipping into a
unified market versus carving that market
[SPEAKER_02]: out with individual rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if as an investor or as an operator,
you get set up in one country,
[SPEAKER_02]: then there's opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the size of these markets,
there's opportunities later on if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: able to establish a good brand,
a good quality product, and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: conform within the EU specifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of people are looking to the
EU here in these European countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: The EU is looking to the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: The US isn't really doing anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's kind of like which domino will
fall first before there's a rapid
[SPEAKER_02]: acceleration of reform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's tough to predict.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna opine on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if some of these larger countries,
like I said, don't make some clarity on
[SPEAKER_02]: their policies, then they may be
supplanted as world leaders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to bless through this
presentation so that I could take some
[SPEAKER_02]: questions later on, because I'm sure
there's lots of questions on the data,
[SPEAKER_02]: or at least I hope there are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're too shy to make any
questions, then feel free to reach out
[SPEAKER_02]: with my contact information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be more than happy to share this
presentation and some of the data with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of prediction, Germany is on
the cusp of being the first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm anticipating a rapid
expansion of reform.
[SPEAKER_02]: These pilot programs and social clubs,
it's a novel idea, and it's worth
[SPEAKER_02]: pursuing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And look for a regulation around certified
seeds, because you have to start with
[SPEAKER_02]: stable genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now in the United States,
you don't have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Europe, it's pretty established.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very established market,
the certified seed program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And public safety will remain foremost in
the eyes of the policymakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as business operators, it's
important to consider public safety and
[SPEAKER_02]: build that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hemp will be a major market,
not only in the US, but in Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So recommendations, communicate,
educate, know everything about your
[SPEAKER_02]: business and your country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's important to understand
cost structure, because when I talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: oversupply, what that does is it
compresses margins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, there's inflation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you have falling prices and
increasing costs, that really squeezes the
[SPEAKER_02]: profits out of your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you don't know your cost
structure, then you don't know when to
[SPEAKER_02]: make critical decisions about your
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So understanding cost structure is really,
really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also staying focused on your core
competency.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be everything to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it hasn't proven to be successful in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, vertical integration was in
vogue for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in my delinquency report, I'm finding
that even if you're vertically integrated
[SPEAKER_02]: and control all the costs within your
vertical, they're still one of the largest
[SPEAKER_02]: contributors to delinquency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's still delinquent payment
issues, even in vertical integrated
[SPEAKER_02]: companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important to carve off what you
know and what you're good at, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: pursue that with vigor and passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so another thing is that although
we're in Spain, and a lot of the focus is
[SPEAKER_02]: on Spain at your business, we're in
Germany, the focus isn't on Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so cannabis is a very local issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really remember that this is a global
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's important to act local,
but keep the global market in mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it will have an eventual influence
on your business and on your success.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, feel free to reach out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of data, lots to digest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm happy to take questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone have a question?
[SPEAKER_03]: All the way over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it for Michael Knott.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing all the walking and running.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's very quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very fast for a man in his 50s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Tyler Secor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with Reassure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're based out of Michigan in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, is this data, especially the
delinquent payments, is this among more
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to cannabis, say, growers to
producers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you factor in the safety compliance
testing aspect of this as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: So my delinquent report that's coming out
next week on my website, it's a free
[SPEAKER_02]: report.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked at not only all the sectors and
subsectors within cannabis, laboratory
[SPEAKER_02]: testing includes certified public
accountants, but it also looked at
[SPEAKER_02]: ancillary businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was presenting at a group of
CPAs, certified public accountants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, who's more boring, economists or
accountants?
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of vote accountants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in that, the accountants, the CPAs
were saying that they're not getting paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these ancillary businesses lawyers
aren't getting paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the question becomes an ethical
dilemma for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we not pay or do their taxes this
season because they haven't paid us for
[SPEAKER_02]: last season?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do we go ahead and just put more
revenue at risk?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there needs to be some discipline
in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looked at all sectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Retail had it the easiest because they are
closest to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they tended to be the ones that
didn't pay through the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: The product manufacturers and the
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivators on a percentage basis took it
the hardest, meaning that they had the
[SPEAKER_02]: toughest time getting payment from others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the vertical integrated companies
were also big contributors and multi-state
[SPEAKER_02]: operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the average per MSO was
like $32 million in delinquent payments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody's contributing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there could be some regulation or
regulatory intervention that's required to
[SPEAKER_02]: mandate payment adherence or cash on
delivery or what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a bit of an extended answer to your
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Michigan is a tough market because
there's lots of operators falling prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got huge legal participation
because the consumers like their lower
[SPEAKER_02]: prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's tough to be profitable in that
type of environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you're not getting paid on
top of that, 10 months of cash flow for a
[SPEAKER_02]: 12-month business, that's not a recipe for
success.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Victor Jerez, independent advisor's
principal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found your comment about how in the
United States, through the farm bill,
[SPEAKER_01]: they defined hemp versus cannabis or
marijuana as a pivotable move.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's a problematic move,
obviously, with THC8, 9, and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One question I have for you is that in 17,
18, CBD was present in so many consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: products in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the definition of hemp as
distinct and it going from DEA to FDA,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's run into a thicket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just wondering if you could share with
the audience some of the learnings of that
[SPEAKER_01]: experience and if there's any
applicability to the market development
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to the evolution of the
hemp industry, early on in between 2014
[SPEAKER_02]: and 2018, there was very few farms that
grew hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they did, they grew it for fiber
and for grain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result, there wasn't a lot of
cannabinoid plants and raw materials
[SPEAKER_02]: available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the cost of CBD isolate,
for example, could easily run $40,000 a
[SPEAKER_02]: kilo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then people seeking riches of seeing those
high prices, they entered into the market
[SPEAKER_02]: due to one of the agricultural reform
bills called the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at one point, 525,000 acres were
licensed.
[SPEAKER_02]: 82% of that was for cannabinoid
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was very little processing,
little drawing, and little awareness on
[SPEAKER_02]: how to grow this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was a surplus of cannabinoid
raw materials in the market that drove
[SPEAKER_02]: prices down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The very next year, people didn't learn
from their mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other states entered into it and doubled
the amount of excess inventory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had this 201 million pounds of
excess cannabinoid raw material,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2 million kilos of CBD isolate just
sitting on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody had to figure out how to
monetize that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that brought in some emerging
innovation in the Delta 8, Delta 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: HHC markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were able to develop products
that were intoxicating that had market
[SPEAKER_02]: demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were able to consume a lot of
that raw material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now that a lot of that raw material
inventory has been consumed, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers have gotten out of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of having 525,000 acres,
you're back to pre-farm bill at 30,000
[SPEAKER_02]: acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a majority of that now is fiber and
grain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a common theme here where you
have this huge spike on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now it's going back to its roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the fiber and grain sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: But policymakers have been trying to
address the influx of cannabinoids into
[SPEAKER_02]: and competing with the medical and adult
use products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I did the analysis and
published this late last year,
[SPEAKER_02]: the total addressable market in the United
States for cannabinoids derived from hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: was $28 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, last year, the sales of legal adult
use and medical was $28 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a huge market which may or may
not be able to be sustained with the
[SPEAKER_02]: current amount of acreage right now that's
being licensed in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, can Europe learn from that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they've already have kind of taught
the US a lesson where they've controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: the production, they've insisted on
certified seed, they have good regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tight control, but there's still
opportunity nonetheless for hemp in the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States, especially on the fiber and
grain side for industrial applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20% of Mercedes cars are parts derived
from hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's already these industrial
applications in automobile industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: plastics and the like that go beyond the
cannabinoid side of the hemp market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe one more guy, or do we have time for
one more question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We even went over by like a minute and a
half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm a benevolent and kind MC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it again for Bo Whitley.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have...
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
