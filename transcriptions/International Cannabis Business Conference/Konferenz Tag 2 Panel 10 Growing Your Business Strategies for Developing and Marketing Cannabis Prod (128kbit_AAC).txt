[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my name is Benjamin Patok.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, as introduced, I work for Boveda.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people call it Boveda, so we do these
little humidification pouches that
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody loves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't know them, we're still
outside with a booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come by, get a sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to just have everybody introduce
yourselves really quickly, and we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to dive into the matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll start with Chris, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, servus.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Chris Ulick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with Ceres Greenhouse Solutions,
and we do energy-efficient greenhouses for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but also for other purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Adam Coats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the chief revenue officer at Decibel
Cannabis Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a cultivator and manufacturer in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for staying here so late on.
[SPEAKER_02]: This afternoon, my name is Laurie Glauser.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the CEO of Evio Labs, a 12-lab
testing lab company in the US and Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also have worked in consulting area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm here in Germany looking at
opportunities in the German market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can applaud.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about strategies for
developing and marketing cannabis products
[SPEAKER_03]: and beyond and before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way I want to look at it is,
first, if you want to enter the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: market, that can be a challenge per se,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about the challenges that
you guys faced just trying to be a part of
[SPEAKER_03]: that market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just anyone, how you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were founded.
[SPEAKER_00]: We founded the company in 2011 before we
had our first cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2015, that cannabis product came
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first things we learned is we had
to separate our websites, because all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden, banks were saying, well,
you can't do business with you anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's little things like that along the
way that we've learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started in the business in 2013,
2014 doing compliance licensing for
[SPEAKER_02]: clients and then moved into the testing
space pretty soon thereafter.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we found at first was actually for
many of us, it was actually fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming from industry, I came from the
energy consulting space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming in at that time was relatively
easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting a company was relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting licensed back then was relatively
easy, but it very quickly got very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because competition started to increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulators started really locking down
regulations and costs increased.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, banks, you know,
I had to reopen 12 bank accounts in the US
[SPEAKER_02]: as well, so multiple times over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, I would say that the real
challenges that emerged later largely were
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory and fitting into a semi-illegal
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think the regulatory aspect is
something that's really important to
[SPEAKER_01]: consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you're starting a business,
as you're thinking about getting products
[SPEAKER_01]: to market, and whatever that market may
be, whether it's the US, Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: or some of the other kind of more emerging
markets, it's really important to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the regulatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just about in every market,
maybe aside from the US, you're very
[SPEAKER_01]: limited in terms of what you can do from a
marketing standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can almost throw out all the
different playbooks that are out there for
[SPEAKER_01]: a consumer good or a medical good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my biggest advice to you, if you're
starting up a business or looking to get
[SPEAKER_01]: products to market, is focus on the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the bells and whistles of social
media and marketing agencies, and don't
[SPEAKER_01]: spend a ton of time or a ton of money and
resources on what the brand is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be, what it looks like, what it feels
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you need to have something that
looks well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the most important thing and the most
marketable thing that you're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: is your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It matters what's inside the jar,
not necessarily what the jar looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is what your consumers are going
to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: To put it in perspective, Decibel has a
brand called General Emission.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is by far the largest product brand in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only two weeks ago did we have a
functioning website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we focused on the product, being
innovative with the products that we put
[SPEAKER_01]: out, understanding what the addressable
markets were and where they're pockets of
[SPEAKER_01]: volumes were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that allowed us to be tremendously
successful as we focused on the product
[SPEAKER_01]: and how it was going to meet our
consumers' needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you can still do that in all
the different jurisdictions of selling and
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the biggest marketing tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just directly to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your biggest challenge then was product
development?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the biggest challenge is
understanding the right segments to go
[SPEAKER_01]: into and to compete in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you find your edge in those
larger segments in the industry that will
[SPEAKER_01]: allow you to be successful and build a
profitable company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some of the products that sound
really great, that may be more of the
[SPEAKER_01]: purest products, may not have a very wide
consumer base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're building really great
products, but they're really expensive and
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a very low addressable market,
you're going to be very challenged to
[SPEAKER_01]: build a successful business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the moderator here has talked a
lot about the beer industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the beer industry also has brands like
Corona and Bud Light and Miller Light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those big brands, those aren't the
most sophisticated products necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're the ones that have the most
broad appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to really think about that as
you're building your business and building
[SPEAKER_01]: your product and marketing strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like the idea of the wine,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also because we live in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alcohol is fairly mildly regulated
compared to other environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can buy beer in every
supermarket when you're 16.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're probably here somewhere,
tobacco, same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in that venue here, there might be a
tobacco vending machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you still have to swipe an ID card.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in some nightclubs, but you're not
allowed to go in under 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this doesn't even have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my approach was always to regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not so much as, will cannabis be as
wine from a regulatory perspective?
[SPEAKER_03]: But what will the regulation of cannabis
will do to those industries?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because cannabis will be the most
regulated drug or legal drug in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think regulation plays a big,
big part of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you all have faced regulatory
struggles, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd love to tap your mind on that,
really.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what were the big struggles?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you overcome them?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing I've learned along the way,
and I would advise others going into this
[SPEAKER_02]: business, is first start out not only
looking at the federal and or state laws
[SPEAKER_02]: that are coming out, but also start early
looking at the other compliance areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the GMP rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at ISO rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't wait to hire a consultant to put a
line in your business plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hire a GMP consultant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Start today reading what those rules are,
what those requirements are, and build
[SPEAKER_02]: your business around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, once you've built your business
around these rules, you've built your
[SPEAKER_02]: SOPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: SOPs are not shelf wear.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not something that somebody writes
them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You win this application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you train everybody the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people kind of forget they exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really need to make sure those SOPs
are true working documents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And keeping your teams on point,
reviewing those SOPs, and modifying the
[SPEAKER_02]: SOPs to match your actual day-to-day
operations is also really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a building these facilities
perspective, we're facing the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: right with GMP.
[SPEAKER_00]: GACP in the US, it's not even a topic for
most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some customers that we talk to think a
little bit into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we as a provider of buildings,
we're actually dealing with an
[SPEAKER_00]: international market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're designing building here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have customers in Australia,
in New Zealand, in the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, you get exposed to
different types of regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: different local regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different types of GMP and GACP
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also see that there's different
interpretation of these regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we are learning as a business
is to essentially not necessarily try to
[SPEAKER_00]: hit all these rules, but be prepared for
our customers that when we are building
[SPEAKER_00]: something in the US, that when the market
opens up in two or three years,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that facility still functions,
and that they can upgrade it or add
[SPEAKER_00]: features so that they can get those
certifications when they are needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that little foresight is
important in the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to turn it to is you can't
do all of this on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always need to have a partner or
someone that you need to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to find the right partners as
you are building your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings that expertise to the table,
advises you, and helps you to get there in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, regulations are going to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to change over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you start with is not what you're
going to end with by any stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of mistakes that we've seen
in Canada, and there's been a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, we've made a lot of mistakes
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that's so important
is building optionality and flexibility
[SPEAKER_01]: into what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Chris was talking about,
as he is building out facilities,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's offering to his clients the
optionality in case GMP or GACP is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be required for that certain region.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a small example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't get married to one idea because
that's the way the regulation is today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is going to be evolution that will
create opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're bolted down into something
that becomes immovable because it becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: too much to invest to make the change,
or you're essentially committed into a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain strategy, and then the regulations
change, and you're not able to pivot,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're going to be left behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So building in that flexibility around
your systems and around whether it is your
[SPEAKER_01]: facility or strategy is going to be so
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bedrock of everything that you do,
I'll go back to my earlier comment,
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be about the product,
about what consumer you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: address, and what sides of opportunity
there, and always providing great value
[SPEAKER_01]: for money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mean cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean for whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're the most expensive product,
that's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need to provide the value that's
going to deliver against that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is where the regulation and
the restrictions and guidelines that are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out, you can use them to your
advantage in a lot of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is going to be a huge strategic
advantage of keeping your business nimble
[SPEAKER_01]: and able to react to these changes that
will more than likely over time open up
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities for your business to
flourish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would add to that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to be flexible, and what I've
seen in the market with all the clients
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've worked with over the years,
those who are most focused in the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning tend to be the most successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you may only have one really
fantastic product, but rules are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your formulation is going to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have personal turnover.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might get really excited in the
beginning and want to do a whole line of
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's multiple times the complexity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So staying really focused in the beginning
on doing one thing really well and
[SPEAKER_02]: perfecting that before replicating is also
a lesson that I learned early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, again, going back to Canada,
there's a lot of chasing of shiny pennies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started in craft cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still sort of our hero product in a
lot of ways with the brand Quest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that gave us then permission to go
out, and then we got into the vape
[SPEAKER_01]: category.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a nice line in sanction
into some other categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sort of doing things one at a time in
a way allowed us to stay focused,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also build the business in such a way
where it can then sustain some more
[SPEAKER_01]: complexity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can double that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Boveda is really just a one-trick
pony, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We only have one product in different
variations, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for us, the challenge was, you build it
for, let's say, a recreational market.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden, you have customers that
are in the medicinal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, oh, they have moisture
regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to build around that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have GMP and all these type of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, for us, a US company,
and we source everything in the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States, we'll never be EUGMP because all
of our suppliers would also have to be
[SPEAKER_03]: EUGMP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we source in the United States,
we can't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to build a production line over
here to achieve that, and so on,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on, and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yet, still GMP, FDA GMP.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's ways around it some places.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the focus point, what you guys
mentioned, I think is very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be really good in your core
service or product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a product or service.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next thing is, you're not alone,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you differentiate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my perspective on it is one of the
things that we've done really well is
[SPEAKER_01]: customer service.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it's making sure you have a really
great product that serves, and basically
[SPEAKER_01]: serves a consumer need and consumer
tensions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's followed up with customer
service, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those who are in sort of more emerging,
I call them emerging markets like Germany
[SPEAKER_01]: and Australia and the UK and some of the
others that are making headlines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, what a lot of Canadian LPs
are doing or kind of other LPs that are
[SPEAKER_01]: exporting into these markets is they're
basically dumping and running,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've made the sale, they've got product
move over, and then it's kind of wipe
[SPEAKER_01]: their hands and move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Servicing your customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like so basic, but it's amazing
how much that is not done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And understanding and being there for them
and following up and problem solving when
[SPEAKER_01]: things don't go right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because let's face it, it's cannabis,
and it's a very fickle plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every once in a while, something is
going to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's how you back that up by being
there and being partners in what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing and actually making sure that you
provide that great service.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, that is the second way to stand
out is having exceptional product that is
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent as you can get, that is
innovative and addressing consumers'
[SPEAKER_01]: needs, and then following it up with
customer service and just doing what you
[SPEAKER_01]: say you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to be a very novel concept
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's funny, listening to Adam,
you're looking at it from the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective and bringing the plant into a
product that you then sell to customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very similar story for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as a product, we have a product
that's unique worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have patents and we have IP to protect
that and protect it into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the core of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on top of that, the focus is on
delivering that consistent product.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, it's those greenhouses to our
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big thing that we realized early on is
also customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you build a facility like
this, you can't just run away after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Customers do not know how to run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started essentially incorporating
into our contracts an offering that we
[SPEAKER_00]: stay engaged with our customers to make
sure that they get what they bought from
[SPEAKER_00]: us with regards to the outcome,
how that environment is controlled,
[SPEAKER_00]: how those rooms and those systems are
functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same story, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're doing a completely different
business and we're supplying cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the story behind it, the business
terms, are very similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So customer service, it's probably not
just limited to the cannabis industry per
[SPEAKER_03]: se.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's more like a general truth,
I reckon, unless you wanted to say
[SPEAKER_03]: something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, no, customer service.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that also the pathway into real
customer loyalty?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what we're all looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want loyal customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laurie, you want to start in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my area, we provided B2B services.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also worked with a number of
customers that had product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched the product development process
of companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I saw them from the formulation stage
through the development stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw which products were successful
and which were not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, of course, the quality point
is most important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have focus on one product and really
getting that feedback from customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just say that it is like virtually
any other products.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really what it comes down to is
making sure you're really hyper-focused on
[SPEAKER_02]: the customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as it comes to the competitors,
I think if you're really focused on your
[SPEAKER_02]: customer and listen to your customer and
if they go to a competitor, ask them why
[SPEAKER_02]: did they go to that competitor and work
with them from that way, really develop
[SPEAKER_02]: those relationships.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would actually take that another step
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's from personal
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can look at customer service as
part of a P&L and say, I've got to be
profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to put a number in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I've used up that number,
I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't work in an industry like
cannabis where mistakes are being made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adam just mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there are suppliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's problems with builders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in our case, there's different
regulations in different countries and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge that's there or not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we don't engage with our customers
beyond just looking at a P&L and just
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, look, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This customer needs to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we will not survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would go that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, customer service sounds so cliche.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just is not happening in a very
meaningful way in cannabis, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think parts of the problems that you
see in some cannabis companies failing is
[SPEAKER_01]: that the folks in the C-suite who are
making decisions aren't aware of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: being said about their product,
about their business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes such a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself and our head of marketing product
who's here with me today, we used to
[SPEAKER_01]: answer the customer emails that's on the
label of every one of our products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to personally do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not scalable for us to do that all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still an inbox in our outlook
that we look at every single day to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand when stuff is going wrong,
what are consumers saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how can we fix that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there an opportunity in these
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's amazing when you actually respond
back and say, hey, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's how I'm going to fix this for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we have a big customer in Israel where
we ship our product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something wasn't looking or feeling right
and flew over there the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And walked through it and made a solution
that fit for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to go above and beyond to
support it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they'll remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it becomes easier when things don't go
right all the time, that you can overcome
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not losing a piece of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it sounds really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just showing up and being there and
doing what you're going to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a very simple business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also not being done enough in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's also what is really
hurting our industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well with some less than, I say,
quality actors.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could add to that too, it may be that
we're not budgeting customer service the
[SPEAKER_02]: way we should.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're putting in this big marketing
budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's 10%, 15%, 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Revenue is marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what is marketing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Marketing is keeping the existing
customers happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And perhaps that's a gap that we're not
really focused on investing into the
[SPEAKER_02]: customer service area.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so to summarize, it's kind of a
simple business in a complicated,
[SPEAKER_03]: regulated world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of ways, it has been made overly
complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong, it is a tremendously
complex and capital intensive business.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in all of that, it's very easy
to get lost in the fundamentals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or have the fundamentals be lost of really
am good product, big addressable market,
[SPEAKER_01]: service your customer well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying anything revolutionary
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think because it moves so quick,
because the regulations can be very
[SPEAKER_01]: confusing and changing all the time,
and there's a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: theses and approaches to this industry,
that those key elements can really get
[SPEAKER_01]: lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do those things well,
then I think you can really be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Decibel is a great example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're profitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cash flowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not really any Canadian
licensed producers out there that can
[SPEAKER_01]: really say the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were joking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're that one profitable company in
Canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so because time is running low,
are there any questions from the audience?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now's the chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have taught them everything they need
to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you all for being here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everybody on the panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
