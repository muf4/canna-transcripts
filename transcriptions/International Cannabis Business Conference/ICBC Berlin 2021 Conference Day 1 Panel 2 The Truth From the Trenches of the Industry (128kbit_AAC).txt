[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Nick Easley, Managing Director of
Multiverse Capital also CEO of 3C
[SPEAKER_02]: Consulting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in this space for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from the legal industry in Colorado
forward, everything I'm going to say today
[SPEAKER_02]: is from the trenches of the industry from
working with thousands of companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: First quick little disclaimer though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a CPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to use these professionals.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't like 2006, 2010 in California
setting up weird businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must seek out very good counsel,
very good everything when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this industry, we've been doing
this for now nearly two decades legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without these professionals,
all the businesses that we've seen fail,
[SPEAKER_02]: had crappy legal, didn't understand tax
structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's very unique tax structures in
the United States based on IRC-280E.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like if you have companies in the
Netherlands, like BBs here that are doing
[SPEAKER_02]: investments here or there.
[SPEAKER_02]: How companies are structured matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: As all of you individuals know,
most of these companies, this is a startup
[SPEAKER_02]: industry full of startup companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's high levels of risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just make sure you use those levels of
precautions.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, quick little bit of background.
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally from farm country in this
country, Wisconsin, kind of poor farm kid
[SPEAKER_02]: area, was in the United States Air Force.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I spoke languages for the military.
[SPEAKER_02]: And which is actually really helpful from
when you go from enforcing the drug war in
[SPEAKER_02]: South America to now actually being one of
the largest producers in South America and
[SPEAKER_02]: working with those organizations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got hurt in the service and went to
Colorado to get a ski bump, big fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tried medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really big help for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in 2006 I got a medical card and
started using medical cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: realized how people were growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Colorado was the first legal medical
commercial program in the world to where
[SPEAKER_02]: you could actually sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm granted next door in the
Netherlands, 2005, a child in the webcam,
[SPEAKER_02]: like they started by realistically like
for sanctioned legal sales, Colorado is
[SPEAKER_02]: where we started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, first adult use market, regular
marijuana and alcohol in 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: We passed before Washington for the first
recreation cannabis in the history of the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next door in the Netherlands, not so much
legal, kind of happens, gray area which
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll get into.
[SPEAKER_02]: But having worked down in the United
States through over 36 states from a
[SPEAKER_02]: medical standpoint, we have 19 adult use
states, 11 of which have current sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close to probably I think 30 billion in
revenue this year in the United States
[SPEAKER_02]: alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada like 2.5 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'll make fun of Canada a little
bit, but back on it this way and just make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure everything I'm going to share with
you is like truth from the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I offend you, your country,
your investments, you can't fix stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not here to offend.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you fight the truth, you lose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a big thing that we learned,
you know, medical cannabis has been
[SPEAKER_02]: expanding internationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a very big difference in medical
cannabis in the United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada, and Uruguay compared to the rest
of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same as adult use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adult use in Canada, legal from the
government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything we do in the United States is
federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I might violate federal law every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think Pablo Escobar, that's what we do
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we follow state law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've never broken state law for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And federal, we just try not to think
about that one too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're kind of like a little big now,
so it's kind of like happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is like Schumer's bill, the Moore
Act, CARE Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of those are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from a federal legalization standpoint
in the United States, we're a ways away
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything on the table is not going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on a global standpoint, it's a
compassionate use of medical program under
[SPEAKER_02]: the 1961 single treaty on psychotropic
substances from the United Nations,
[SPEAKER_02]: which currently the United States and many
countries are in violation of because some
[SPEAKER_02]: very big news happened this last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a delayed vote with the
Commission for Narcotic Drugs under the
[SPEAKER_02]: International Narcotics Control Board for
the UN.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the CND, the Commission for Narcotics
Drugs, kind of quietly, this last
[SPEAKER_02]: December, which was supposed to be March
before, but then round out, we rescheduled
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis internationally at the UN level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis is no longer the same as
heroin, like it was forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it went to a different schedule,
schedule three, knowing that it actually
[SPEAKER_02]: has a decent value means more medical
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a big deal for investors to
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not talking about heroin anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're single track cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's all this new psychedelic
kind of industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, and the agents are going to be
great for the mind, for the body,
[SPEAKER_02]: for science and research.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're single track cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only do one crazy thing at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, you know, drink and drive and
speed, not advocate for drink and drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only do one weird thing at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to do cannabis,
don't do cannabis and cryptocurrency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one weird thing at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this UN vote, it changed things.
And it's freaking new crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of the blue, when they were doing
that vote, it was like two in the morning
[SPEAKER_02]: my time, Ukraine was going to abstain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he looked forward and he's like,
yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it happened by one vote and it
was Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sad thing, Ukraine didn't then like pass
the medical bill about a month and a half,
[SPEAKER_02]: two months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But fucking Ukraine, yes, Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They changed it big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little thing happened this last year,
round out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of unfortunate when it comes to like
cannabis investments and what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Massive supply chain interruptions.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this massive proliferation of
international expansion that we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: doing in the United States, international
security market share in all these places,
[SPEAKER_02]: it changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cost of construction, balloon,
steel, packaging, everything is so much
[SPEAKER_02]: more delayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for investments, as we were securing
all these positions and then we couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: fly and actually take care of these
portfolio companies, shit got crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when the one caps away, the mice will
play.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a lot of faces in here who know like
I've worked with you in Africa,
[SPEAKER_02]: in South America, in Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, what's going on in that
country?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know, we can't get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're spending crazy money.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you do a hospital takeover in a
country you can't even get into?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like Warren Buffett said,
like never let a good crisis go to waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a crisis of attrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was literally the moment that no
one realizes now what happened in March
[SPEAKER_02]: last year, like March 21st, when the stock
market was like shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doubling, I didn't sleep for four
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was buying companies, a public
market that I normally think are garbage
[SPEAKER_02]: that I wouldn't touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate their executives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known them from their starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: When their stock was going from like 25 to
19 to $2.40 a share because I bought like
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy deployments in capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also then during this time, a lot of these
public companies had no good liquidity on
[SPEAKER_02]: their books.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were massively unloaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were selling assets, like things that
Canopy did in Spain, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: spent 50, 60 million euros to secure some
of these positions, these initial things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, we were buying stuff for
pennies on the dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like now, like that 2.40 cent share,
that's up at like 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sadly, even though many of you,
if you know me, I talk a lot of crap on
[SPEAKER_02]: Canadian public companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of the shell listed ones on
the CSE and the TSX that actually do not
[SPEAKER_02]: invest in the United States and our
companies are listed up there because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: federally legal in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's where the money is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where the change is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's still a moment to get into
some of these huge things here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in companies as they're raising like
capital, which when you think of your
[SPEAKER_02]: betting investment opportunities here in
Europe, there are not many.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of them are garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're having a few with Canopi and a few
others like on the London exchange,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to see some more starting on
the Frankfurt exchange, Tel Aviv.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada has been where like most of the
action is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Canada with 40 million people,
already a very illicit market that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not where international cannabis is
really going to like take effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people lost their asses in
Canada investing in massive big things
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to like small private companies
that were scaling in the United States
[SPEAKER_02]: when it's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the United States, we have this tax
code IRC28E.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very important because the United States
is where we're going to talk and make,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's where we make all of our money that
allows all our international expansion.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I've done is spend hundreds of
millions of dollars around the world
[SPEAKER_02]: securing positions, nurturing companies
because we don't grow pineapples in Canada
[SPEAKER_02]: in warehouses to like have pineapples.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they come from other countries,
the same with coffee, the same with other
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to think like longer term.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as investors, you know, you've got
like your short positions, your mediums,
[SPEAKER_02]: your long, what are your long term
strategic visions?
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes just like a short squeeze,
it'll kill you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it squeezes you for too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what happened with Canopy and
tons of these other companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They held all these positions,
had all these shorts, and they just had to
[SPEAKER_02]: like massive shitting at their books to
get things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you would see like to the rate of
buying, like massive of a harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long established like hemp seed company,
just because it does revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're buying all these other
companies just to look like, look at all
[SPEAKER_02]: this revenue they're making, just to trick
investors to keep their stock prices high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's very hard to raise capital from
these small scale private companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really, multi risk capital,
we structure and really focus on seed
[SPEAKER_02]: stage, series A, series B, getting those
little baby unicorns, catching them,
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding them, taking care of them,
and then getting them ready for like
[SPEAKER_02]: future assets or acquisitions,
which has been a big strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, in the United States,
IRC-280 is tax code from 1982.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you normally know your cost of goods
sold, like for that, what your deductions
[SPEAKER_02]: are, appreciation.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little thing no one understands is this
thing called EBITDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some of you have heard of it,
based on your backgrounds, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis operators did not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in IRC-280E, when you cannot deduct
your normal cost of goods sold,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't claim your depreciation,
you can't insulate assets, you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: deduct your interest expense, nor your tax
expense, your net at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_02]: might be 30 to 40% less than in normal
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the thing that's crazy, IRC-280E is
only applicable in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's only applicable to companies that
deal in the unregulated control,
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacture, and distribution of schedule
one and schedule two narcotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that whole thing I said about the
U.N.
[SPEAKER_02]: and how we rescheduled that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The United States, we're members of the
United Nations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in violation of the U.N.
[SPEAKER_02]: drug treaties, which we actually pushed
like assholes to right back in the day to
[SPEAKER_02]: like really kick him and huff to go
against that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're actually in violation of that
policy the moment that the international
[SPEAKER_02]: narcotics control board and the CND and
WHO, which we were members of until like
[SPEAKER_02]: that last president, which we don't like
to talk about, decided to leave the WHO
[SPEAKER_02]: during a goddamn global pandemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's maybe why this didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the moment the United States starts to
follow U.N.
[SPEAKER_02]: drug treaties, IRC-280E goes away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the CARE Act, MOAR Act,
it's not Schumer's bill that's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh, now the institutional capital
and the banking can come into this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we follow that IRC-280E up the
window, companies now, for their need to
[SPEAKER_02]: know, tax expense, interest expense,
depreciation, cost of goods sold
[SPEAKER_02]: deductions, we get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's literally the silver bullet to
companies in the United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially the MSS, Cresto, Trulium,
Curaleaf, Harvest, Forefront, on and on
[SPEAKER_02]: and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when if you're in those and that
happens, you're going to see a bump,
[SPEAKER_02]: not giving them security advice here,
but you're going to see a bump in like 34%
[SPEAKER_02]: to 40%, 50% under stock value pretty much
day one to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just watch and know that that's a very
significant day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in the United States, where I'm from,
up there by Canada, that gray one up at
[SPEAKER_02]: the top, and sorry, I realized actually
that this one I forgot to change it at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have Virginia on there now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mississippi happened for medical,
but their Supreme Court said like,
[SPEAKER_02]: ah, the voters didn't understand what they
were voting for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Voters don't know where it stopped at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then South Dakota actually passed a
medical and recreational in the same boat,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then their governor is kind of an
asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like the governor of Maine used to
be and didn't allow that to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you look at this password from
when it was like California in 1996 with
[SPEAKER_02]: the Compassionate Use Act, the first
medical cannabis Compassionate Use Act in
[SPEAKER_02]: the United States, they didn't allow
commercial sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, I'm a non-profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I build plans for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sell plans for people, but we don't make
any money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado was the first.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you think about what's happening,
only a matter of time, and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Texas is a giant place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a medical program, but only for
good childhood epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is really weird to watch companies
and grants that start.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a very illicit medical market.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those medical states originally,
we call them the Dirty Seven, California,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon, Washington, Michigan, Maine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a medical program where you
could have like this piece of paper up on
the wall and say, I could have 90 plants
for Jamie, 90 plants for Thelma,
90 plants for Steve.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not selling it, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you have states like Oklahoma,
in which they're growing copious amounts
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis, and it's kind of like leaving
those states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now a big thing, under President Trump,
past President Trump, my goodness,
[SPEAKER_02]: he put in Jeff Sessions as the attorney
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: That little Kepler Elf, what you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of an asshole, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone got kind of an asshole.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Kepler Elf man, he was like,
hey, there's this thing from James Cole.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, this Cole memorandum had
eight rules that states had to follow in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to have a legal medical cannabis
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, this doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty much, that's the only guidance
we had to follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he said it was garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when that happened, it's like,
let's still follow that because what's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the moment of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are definitely too big to fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't like, are people gonna buy
shoes online?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those apples might not be a good
investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uber, who's gonna use that?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's taxi apps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is already a bona fide market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the United States doesn't want you to
know this, nor the DBA, which has a
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful logo, like that flying eagle,
like the Drug Enforcement Administration
[SPEAKER_02]: for the assholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our listed market in the United States is
supposed to $200 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: $200 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say it's about 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want you to know the truth on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot more people use cannabis than
actually admit on their little service.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say, a government survey would
admit to breaking federal law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is really rare to watch,
and there's major things happening now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, these new states that are coming
with, so Connecticut actually already had
[SPEAKER_02]: their owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to go on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: New medical states like Alabama,
South Dakota did happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only a matter of time in the United
States until this happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were the assholes that made this
kind of illegal all over the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: back from William Randolph Hearst.
[SPEAKER_02]: You read that book, the Emperor Wears No
Clothes, Jack Herrera back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was nothing to do with smoking
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all about paper industry,
cotton industry, petrochemical industries
[SPEAKER_02]: being like, fuck, we own all the forests
and the paper mills, and it happens way
[SPEAKER_02]: better than all our shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should make that sound bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then they used their journalism,
yellow journalism, to write about reefer
[SPEAKER_02]: madness, African Americans raping white
women, devils lettuce, scary stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: just to really make progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did that, and now it's kind of
weird that we're going to be the first
[SPEAKER_02]: ones to make $100 billion a year from this
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry about all that, but we're working
on making that better now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every day, especially based on
coronavirus, states lost so much tax
[SPEAKER_02]: revenue and jobs, they don't care about
cannabis anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, hey, George Floyd,
all the things that happened this last
[SPEAKER_02]: year related to social equity,
minorities, the United States alone,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's over 1 million African Americans
or Latinos that go to private prisons
[SPEAKER_02]: every year for minor cannabis offenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the private prison industry is also
one of the biggest lobbyists against
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization in the United States,
because that's their revenue, which is an
[SPEAKER_02]: absolute way to make revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big triple bottom line believer.
[SPEAKER_02]: People, planet, profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You steal from the environment or you
steal from people, your profit is not
[SPEAKER_02]: genuine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not genuine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a vandana shiva principle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you think about what
profitability is possible in this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, especially in the United States,
epic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now foreign nationals don't invest into
something federally illegal in another
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Homeland security, not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ancillary, which we'll get into.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was making fun of Canada before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they were the first on like a
national medical program, other than
[SPEAKER_02]: Uruguay, but Uruguay's kind of like the
lady that didn't even care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though in the beginning, we were
really terrified that an international
[SPEAKER_02]: narcotics legal board was gonna like cramp
down on Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing for their adult use program.
[SPEAKER_02]: We watched, nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have a G8 country like Canada,
be like, legal, good, medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: We send it in the mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like routine, ha ha, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they legalized adult use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're like, is this shit gonna
like, are they gonna go after a G8
[SPEAKER_02]: country?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like we're pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trudeau and everyone knows like we're
pretty good now, especially since they've
[SPEAKER_02]: already raised about 300 million dollars
just in those public companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more that's undisclosed to the
private.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all of those public companies was
like, this is gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started calling on those crashes
very, very early.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone thought I was freaking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love private companies that scale and
grow mergers, acquisitions, IPOs,
[SPEAKER_02]: normal business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot com, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that bubble burst because so many of
them were garbage companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same with those bubbles forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, we're gonna grow cannabis
for the whole world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're the first ones to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada's cold as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not where you wanna have massive
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been buying greenhouses in Canada,
really fancy Dutch ones, disassembling
[SPEAKER_02]: them, bringing them across the United
States border and reassembling them for
[SPEAKER_02]: literally less than 10 cents a dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they started to close these
things, it was like, hmm, maybe we're not
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna supply the world because our cost of
production is so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now there's almost 800 companies
in Canada, through Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get your LP originally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get your health license, and then you
have to build your whole facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: have an inspection, then get your final
approval license.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 800 companies currently building
out more facilities in Canada to make
[SPEAKER_02]: water, just to put more water in the
ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't need more cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's such an oversupply of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every year, supply surges in Canada,
all lies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, any public company press release you
read from Canada, 97% chance it's pure
[SPEAKER_02]: bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or actually, it's an old study book.
[SPEAKER_02]: This may not, each room may be all lies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just signed this big deal, Tillerick,
and they signed that deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember the company, Novartis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We signed an agreement with Novartis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was when we signed in for a meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did a big press release, stopping at $113
million in market share in that fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: From signing in to have a meeting about
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just know that that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been trying to put it throughout
business for years, because our lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: company, The Sun, I always say this,
it's the best lighting company in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And growing plants for over half a billion
years, biology degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sun outdoor, four season hybrid
greenhouse, that's the wave of the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor, we only did it to go inside the
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're investing in a massive
50,000-hectare indoor facilities,
[SPEAKER_02]: your cost of reduction, on a Catholic
standpoint, is about six times the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your op-ex is about six times as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paying for electricity, heat check,
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, indoor is good for R&D, smaller scale,
not for growing all the pineapples for the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you always want to think about these
things from a normal business standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the profitability KPIs for
whatever it is you're investing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it's a cannabis thing,
doesn't mean it's going to be a good
[SPEAKER_02]: investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2014, 15, 16, ooh, cannabis,
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the only thing in the world
that matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really have to think about,
what are their standards?
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many people say this, and so do I,
but we are a compliance industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we are compliant, we have the
privilege of cultivating, manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_02]: distributing controlled substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not compliant, at high level
standards, it's not bona fide in my mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't want to touch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a risk factor for our
investors, even a whiff of anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: bad going on, out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it is potentially, it's a unicorn
that's going to break its leg and die.
[SPEAKER_02]: So always look at those other sorts of
people, and what are the metrics of this
[SPEAKER_02]: company?
[SPEAKER_02]: True financial models, audited financial
models.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many companies don't even know what
that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So make sure to evaluate cannabis just
like any other business opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're new to this industry,
we've done this for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can look at something and say garbage,
and you're like, I already put five
[SPEAKER_02]: million into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was probably a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what can you do to get your mind out
of a changeover?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another kind of big thing, you know,
with any cannabis, there's like THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is actually THC-A.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's this like wacky sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's over 260 known cannabinoids,
from like what Dr. Mishulin originally
[SPEAKER_02]: found out back in the 60s in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's this big one, Delta-8 right
now, that everyone's talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets you kind of fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I accidentally had a Delta-8 candy in
North Carolina last week at this
[SPEAKER_02]: conference I was at.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just giving them wings like a
little goodie bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't late.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, Taffy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like sitting up that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably eat five pounds of food,
like two and a half kilos of food,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I couldn't sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, they're giving me shit out to
children.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have zero patience for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like gummy bears with cannabis or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to be responsibly compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But any of these other novel cannabinoids,
CBG, that was cool in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a CBD company now, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Realistically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, unless you're giving me your
supply, from like a GMP producer in
[SPEAKER_02]: Romania, Poland, Colombia, and other
states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you're producing CBD in
California, I probably don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like, you're some new novel CBD
company, the biggest CBD industry we've
[SPEAKER_02]: ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also an amazing medicinal
cannabinoid that needs more research.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so many garbage companies got into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Delta-8's gonna be scheduled like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBN, just look and vet these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it's null doesn't mean it's
gonna be habitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in Europe, you got some massive
opportunities here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not so much yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We qualified for some of those German
tampers early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they took that 2,200 kilo block away,
which was like, I'm like, we got a license
[SPEAKER_02]: in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like to literally grow in space
this big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, that was a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And EFARC's like, let's stop that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now this is the new program too,
not gonna be profitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't speak German, so if you
cut a lot or get your voice like that last
[SPEAKER_02]: part, then it's gonna be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cannabis produced in Germany would be
so expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to like Portugal, or some of
these other countries that have worked in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now yeah, Greece is part of the European
Union.
[SPEAKER_02]: No offense, Greece, I don't know how
they're part of the European Union.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Greece was gonna be this huge thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They copied this really laws, which meant
that everything had to have a standard
[SPEAKER_02]: deviation of zero to be exported.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a lot of opportunities there,
but you really have to vet these
[SPEAKER_02]: countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it's North Macedonia,
and you've got this new cool thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: you could do, doesn't mean it's gonna meet
EU GMT standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to say one quick thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not gonna take a break after this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna make up for time and go right
into the next panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got a big great lunch for
everybody right after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep rocking and trying to square
with the last students for a long day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything less than the uncivilized
students.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we won two of the 11 licenses in
Denmark originally.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the first license in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of those in Germany, like massive
opportunities here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, it's so early.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything international, you have to
remember it's under compassionate use,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that takes a doctor to write a
prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical in the United States doctors make
recommendations, not prescriptions,
[SPEAKER_02]: because prescriptions are under the FDA,
which is federally illegal, so they can't
[SPEAKER_02]: write prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than for a few cannabis products
from GMT pharmaceuticals, which is now
[SPEAKER_02]: worth like a billion dollars for a very
crappy 2.5, 2.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any sense, but it refers
so again.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a really important thing for any
international investors to understand in
[SPEAKER_02]: PICS countries, P-I-C-S.
[SPEAKER_02]: These blue ones are the only countries
that fricking matter if you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: develop phased clinical trials or drugs
that are gonna be able to be sold in the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States and Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, oh, I have this cool license
in Zimbabwe, and we're gonna make for
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer, art products for cancer,
we're gonna sell it all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not produced in a PICS country
where clinical trials are done in a PICS
[SPEAKER_02]: country, it will not meet those standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you will have to redo them all
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time is everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things can take up to 11 years and
cost 562 million euros just to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: product to market pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whenever people start talking about
pharma, just know money, big companies,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not about trying to be Pfizer,
it's about trying to be bought by Pfizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you have to think in that kind of
capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you think about this map on top of
where is production allowed,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's why I love South Africa and got
licenses there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Cambodia, even though it's
fricking crazy, same thing with Thailand,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm interested in that because it's a PICS
country long-term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with Portugal, the only country in
Europe that has the most epic climate,
[SPEAKER_02]: cheapest cost of labor, epic surfing,
really good seafood, minus Paco Yao.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually really like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big fan, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're ever thinking about this,
like clinical recently, if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: investing in the pharmaceutical companies,
it's not the cannabis companies right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be their offshoots on these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's really important as you go
through this is know that it's gonna cost
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of money and take way more time than
the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The IP of cannabis can be everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not illegal to own the intellectual
property to do something with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's illegal to do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But owning the intellectual property can
be the biggest value because that's what's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be bought by DuPont and Monsanto and
Pfizer and Moderna and all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: companies in the nation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you must protect that intellectual
property through the right structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Latin America is definitely gonna be a
world leader when you think about Colombia
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love how the past drug war in Colombia
and now they let their plant outside get
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 12 hours at dark, 12 hours at light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big greenhouses get plants ready,
but then outside, boom, massive oil
[SPEAKER_02]: plantations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombia literally could serve the entire
world's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just allowed flower export this
last month, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before it was just oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Evaluations in Colombia are gonna be
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over a hundred licenses in EECA,
only seven of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know three owners of companies in
this room of three of those companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe not the owners, but investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other things are gonna be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peru has massive opportunity with their
president of Russia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be a little weird that Peru can
also change the world because it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: close to the equator when you think about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where cannabis is gonna be
grown long-term.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the waistline of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the further away you are, the more
expensive it's gonna be to do it and the
[SPEAKER_02]: more environmental you're responsible for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Asia's kinda been a big craze for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: China's great on the hemp side.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple things that are kinda huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you think about Cambodia passing
Thailand through university and their
[SPEAKER_02]: programs and what that's gonna be like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinda major Philippines that used to
murder you with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we should talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kinda deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything in Africa is mostly garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine is Lesotho and mine is South Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know the king Swaziland and he's
gonna give you some exclusive license to
[SPEAKER_02]: do something, probably not bona fide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's gonna be some massive
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the shit on the continent,
but like in South Africa they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: so this is Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting place to do business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're gonna have to deal with the
Chinese when it comes to real estate
[SPEAKER_02]: typically.
[SPEAKER_02]: But their clients are good in South
Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing stuff in the Northern
Hemisphere and down here, you're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: two harvests a year of massive R&D action
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just know that a lot of things in
Africa are very volatile and the export's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oceania, the thing I put up here,
really sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, grown up like adult use didn't
pass in New Zealand, which was really sad
[SPEAKER_02]: by just a few votes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was gonna be a big change for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Guam, I got the first medical license
on Guam.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 1.6 billion people that live
within a four hour flight to Guam.
[SPEAKER_02]: So brands for recreational can be legal
there now, which is starting with our
[SPEAKER_02]: first companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we can start brands in
Korean, in Russian, in Japanese,
[SPEAKER_02]: in Chinese, and actually start exposing
tourists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably don't use Canada's for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, play that risk game.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how you get into Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how you get into Asia with seven
troops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's gonna be through Guam,
not Comchato, like everyone thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hilarious, huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: For you investors, foreign nationals,
I make 12, to 18% on real estate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna say that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make 12 to 18% on real estate secured by
a fixed asset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the institution capital cannot
give loans to companies to build their
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses, buy their land, buy their
extraction equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can invest in those things,
and debt is not a financial interest that
[SPEAKER_02]: must be disclosed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can do that in a bona fide way in
the United States or other countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ancillary, from all these sorts of
things, just remember for every dollar
[SPEAKER_02]: spent on a canvas product, the velocity of
capital in canvas is anywhere between four
[SPEAKER_02]: and six dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just think, the United States,
we did 30 billion revenue this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means there's 120 billion of this
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's structured revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're thinking about what's going
on in the future here, that opportunity is
[SPEAKER_02]: well, know from people like what's real,
what's not, what can you do, what can you
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do investment, do diligence, tech
services.
[SPEAKER_02]: I printed off a lot of these things in the
back for specific for investors about what
[SPEAKER_02]: things to do with that deals and
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look out, seek advice, all confidentially
based.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a good idea or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this valuation bona fide or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you don't, even like Deloitte,
even the big, big companies, they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: understand canvas in the way that the
people who have been in the trenches
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting for a couple of decades have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things look different when you've been
battling and you come back and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, whoa, war's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, war's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like run to the front of the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really do your homework.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of good people here, even though you
might look left and right and think like
[SPEAKER_02]: normal investment, these are my
competitors.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, in human history, when we collaborate,
we win.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the collaboration, I put five
million towards something, you put five
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the more that we pull capital,
we put for funds, special purpose vehicles
[SPEAKER_02]: and wise investment managers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to be an expert overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like look around and make partnerships
so great that it gets me back together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's been a long time since we were
able to do this again, but if you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: any questions, we'll be here this next
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a big thanks to Alex and the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: This conference has literally changed the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from a medical, like disabled veteran
standpoint, like giving medicine to
[SPEAKER_02]: patients is our highest priority and doing
this in a responsible way without
[SPEAKER_02]: conferences like this that have been in
the trenches themselves for years,
[SPEAKER_02]: allowing things to happen that we talk
about that are illegal in many places.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's those risk takers that really the
pioneers that made this industry possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a lot of experts here from the
United States, from other countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got questions, we're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want to like rise and grow this
industry together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So absolute pleasure to speak with you
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
Thank you.
