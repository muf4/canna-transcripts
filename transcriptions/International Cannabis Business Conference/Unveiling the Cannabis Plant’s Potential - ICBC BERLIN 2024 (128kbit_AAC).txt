[SPEAKER_03]: Coming up next, we have a small
announcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Professor Dr. Tamara Tomczyk is under the
weather, so we have added some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here to moderate this, German YouTube
star and freelance journalist and author
[SPEAKER_03]: of Cannabis Extraction, Michael Knotz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Michael.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waiting another half a minute till
it's a little bit more quiet here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to our panel, Unveiling the
Cannabis Plant's Potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the first event after Germany
decriminalized cannabis, and that also
[SPEAKER_02]: influences my work, that influences
everybody's work here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give another big up for Germany's
legalization, please, before we begin,
[SPEAKER_02]: please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really proud to present you two
experts today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me start with Dr. Markus Weid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Markus Weid, he has a very long
history as a cannabis researcher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Markus Weid has a very long history and
career in the medicinal plant research.
[SPEAKER_02]: He worked for numerous very famous
projects, universities.
[SPEAKER_02]: He studied in WÃ¼rzburg, and meanwhile,
he started to concentrate on developing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis extracts for his own company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's a manager and founder of Alpha
Topics, GmbH, which is a German company
[SPEAKER_02]: focusing on cannabis extractions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Markus Weid will give us a very
scientific insight in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction and the pharmaceutical
standards of cannabis extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right, Markus?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in the extraction services.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Alpha Topics is providing training and
consultancy for herbal medicinal products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my background is university,
but I also did a lot of support in
[SPEAKER_01]: approval of botanicals and herbal
medicinal products in my career.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was involved in over 100 projects for
registration of herbal medicinal products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the first herbal medicinal product
which was approved by the FDA,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was Verigen, I was involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, so this is my background,
but I'm not in the extraction industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know a lot about extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I could hear from the talk,
and we had before this panel, and I'm very
[SPEAKER_02]: keen to hear more details.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let me introduce Dr. Markus Roggen
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Markus is from Canada, from the country
where cannabis is already legal for five,
[SPEAKER_02]: six years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's the founder of Controlled
Chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's dedicated to cannabinoid research
and, of course, to production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do all the weird and wonderful
chemistry of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is your company's dedicated to?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your role in the Canadian market at
the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in Canada because Canada,
it's legal, and I have the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: framework to play around with all
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm German originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chemistry is like general science,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis will behave chemically the same
way in any country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do the research in Canada,
but it's applicable to any place around
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we act as a contact research
organization for the cannabis industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis curious companies to solve their
various chemistry problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's very good to have your
experience here because your market is
[SPEAKER_02]: already existing while our market is still
developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I come from the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we already have a medical market here
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of you know we have that medical
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And meanwhile, it's a very liberal market,
I would call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very close.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could nearly compare it to the US market
because it's not as complicated anymore to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have over 200,000 patients now
here, which is really a very, very huge
[SPEAKER_02]: increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: But our community, doctors, most
companies, and also patients, they do so
[SPEAKER_02]: as if cannabis only exists of THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody of us who's involved in the topic
knows that a human has an endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system, and not only THC and CBD play a
major role, but also all the other
[SPEAKER_02]: components cannabis contains, the
cannabinoids and the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: play a role when it comes to the medical
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Germany, does anybody know a
company who labels terps or cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know a company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And meanwhile, we have 420 strands in the
pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have extracts in the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really, I do not quite understand
why companies, patients, doctors,
[SPEAKER_02]: wholesalers, and the whole branch doesn't
concentrate on the cannabinoid and the
[SPEAKER_02]: terps more here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know in Canada and the US,
it's a very big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so let me ask Dr. Markus Weid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that so?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a regulatory issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of course, companies are free to
label further cannabinoids and also to
[SPEAKER_01]: label certain terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from a regulatory point of view,
as you label it, it must be part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: specification.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this, you need validated test methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from a formal point of view,
any of this additionally labeled
[SPEAKER_01]: components are APIs, active pharmaceutical
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, they need to be prescribed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you label one more terpenoid or one
more cannabinoid, we do have
[SPEAKER_01]: single-patient prescription here in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these need to prescribe exactly this
product labeled with more than CBD and
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is also a matter of the
pharmacopile model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monograph because there's a
misunderstanding that only flowers or
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts really fitting to this monograph
could be marketed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a prescription, and doctors are free
to prescribe anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the monographs provide a kind of a
framework for minimum quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in minimum, CBD and THC needs to be
labeled, but it could be more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is possible, but difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a doctor is trained, for example,
and at the moment, it's considered
[SPEAKER_02]: probably as extra work, because a doctor
would have to put like five terps on and
[SPEAKER_02]: five cannabinoids on the prescription
extra, which is a doctor doesn't write.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't like to write a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that when it comes to
prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you teach a doctor, if you train
doctors how to, it would be possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and of course, it must be tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it must be part of the specification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the effort you have to release these
products for the market, and this must be
[SPEAKER_01]: done by a qualified person in Germany,
is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need more analytical effort to test
for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also need batch-to-batch
consistency, because you have to label
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what is in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this must be batch-to-batch
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so having cannabis as a
biological product that has its own
[SPEAKER_00]: batch-to-batch variability, keeping it
consistent becomes difficult from a
[SPEAKER_00]: growing aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oils would offer themselves better to
make a consistent product, but even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: extract cannabis, you get batch-to-batch
variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do multifactorial
optimizations, but I fear that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry is in its infancy to
learn all the cool tricks that others in
[SPEAKER_00]: other areas or other industries have
already figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making an extract that is more than
just THC and CBD and prescribable is
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not impossible, but it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you not only have to educate the
consumer and the doctor, but also the
[SPEAKER_00]: producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everyone has to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: What role does cannabinoid and terp
content or labeling play on the Canadian
[SPEAKER_02]: market, on the medical market,
and on the recreational market?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Canada, the qualitative compounds,
cannabinoids, terpenes, they can be tested
[SPEAKER_00]: and labeled by the producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the compounds of concern,
pesticides, heavy metals, they have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: tested by a third-party laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as the producer is kind of OK,
right with the answer, they are fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see labeling of THC, 21 to 26
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just put that on their package,
and it will be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower will be somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the producer also makes themselves
easier by just keeping as little
[SPEAKER_00]: information on the package as possible so
that they can reuse the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're within specs every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you see a lot of new cannabinoids is
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: market, in the hemp space, because
cannabis is illegal in the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_00]: but hemp is legal, and hemp is everything
except Delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there is a wild race to make the
next intoxicating non-Delta-9 THC
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid, and we're testing it on
people if they are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you see loads of labeled
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a very different approach than
our approach here when it comes to medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Markus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One point is important regarding the
statement of Markus, because in Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are not free to label a corridor of 12
to 18 percent or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we do have legal requirements for
herbal medicine and products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the widest range which is possible is
plus minus 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any additional cannabinoid you would
like to label or any additional terpenite
[SPEAKER_01]: you would like to label, would need to
stay in this plus minus 10 corridor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this could be only achieved with
standardized conditions in cultivation and
[SPEAKER_01]: for extracts also in extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you actually get into the
problem that if you want to label minor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and terpenes, they are so low
in concentration that your 10 percent area
[SPEAKER_00]: is outside of the analytical specs they
can achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the test isn't as precise enough to
make it within the 10 percent anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what would you recommend a German
wholesaler or a German pharmacy if they
[SPEAKER_02]: want to focus on a special cannabinoid,
for example, like Charlotteswepp,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that strain that has the special
cannabinoid against epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't need actually so much THC,
but this is not mentioned in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what would you recommend a producer who
wants to focus on cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: He can do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, to sell the product,
he needs to have a doctor prescribing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Germany, you have the situation
without a prescription, you will not sell
[SPEAKER_01]: a single product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to convince doctors of your
concepts and you have to stick to the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is different to Canada and the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have very detailed regulations for
herbal medicine and products and they
[SPEAKER_01]: apply for magisterial preparations in
total.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a company must be capable to do this
standardization, not only for one
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid, but also for others,
which might be better for a given
[SPEAKER_01]: indication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this know-how is needed for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to mix batches of flowers,
you have to mix batches of extracts,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to know your process very well to
be sure to have a batch-to-batch
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent product which reaches the
patient in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask your chemist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So despite it's not as easy as,
let me say, in other markets, you
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrated or you focused on
cannabinoids and you prepared a little
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation for us, like focused on the
cannabinoid issue on the German market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really proud that you give us this
presentation because your scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: background is really unique and I was
impressed when we met in the green room
[SPEAKER_02]: before the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned a lot in those five minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please, I'm really looking forward to
your presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thomas is going to give us a little
presentation about his company,
[SPEAKER_02]: not about his company.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, not about my company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just tried to summarize some points
because the topic today is potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are talking about potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will provide some very brief
keynotes from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, my perspective is medicinal
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other potential, you know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's recreational and well-being
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is not my focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my focus is in the upper left part of
this slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are talking about medicinal
potential now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is medicinal potential?
[SPEAKER_01]: So potential could be figured out looking
for publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for cannabis, this is really unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no other area with such numbers
of publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look in the literature,
you will find nearly, in the meanwhile,
[SPEAKER_01]: nearly 30,000 publications regarding
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the potential of cannabis seems to be
universal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be really universal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day when I enter my office in the
morning, I got messages from new
[SPEAKER_01]: publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will not find a single indication
without data from cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there must be something with cannabis
because it seems to be universal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this also is applicable to the
medicinal potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not only well-being and
recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a huge medicinal potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you look what kind of data is
published, you will very rapidly recognize
[SPEAKER_01]: that most of the data published is
preliminary data.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not conclusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's data-generating hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this slide, you will see the normal
pathway of drug development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in drug development, you have a
discovery phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have preclinical testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have early clinical testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have evaluation, which is phase one
and phase two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for getting normally a medicine
on the market, you need so-called pivotal
[SPEAKER_01]: studies which are conclusive, which have a
high number of patients which need to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: certain standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look for these studies,
you will find very, very low numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the end, we have only three
approved medicines worldwide with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does it mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It means, on the one hand, there might be
an omnipotent potential, but this
[SPEAKER_01]: potential is not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a very important message for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will not stay in this situation
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will not be able to deliver cannabis to
our patients as magister preparations
[SPEAKER_01]: forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need approved medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a normal way worldwide agreed
how patients will have access to medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: by approval.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will not be different for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we live in a transition period in the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody must be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I very often talk to people being not
aware of that, thinking that this will
[SPEAKER_01]: last forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will not be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, in the current situation I
would like to summarize, there's a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, this potential is mainly based on
preliminary or nonconclusive data.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is little conclusive data in some
indications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the medicinal use is mainly based on
no label or little off-label use.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we are doing in Germany is no label
use, which is normally a very
[SPEAKER_01]: extraordinary pathway to the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you will have approved
products, doctors need to prescribe some
[SPEAKER_01]: off-label.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will be no longer allowed to have
this off-label and no-label prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from my perspective, we need to
establish conclusive evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to work for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need approved medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this means, in the future,
this no and off-label use will never,
[SPEAKER_01]: ever tolerate it for a longer period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a transition period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are no special provisions for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for approval of medicines, you have to
stick to the rules and have to do your
[SPEAKER_01]: homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as approved medicines will be
available, doctors need to prescribe them
[SPEAKER_01]: off-label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this no-label use will no longer
tolerate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my anticipation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for developing, and this is now a good
bridge to Marcos, for developing these
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines, which will be approved in
future, we will not have THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with products having THC and CBD,
you will have no IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody will invest a huge amount of
money for clinical studies with no IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need complex extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need other cannabinoids to be
specified.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a proprietary extraction,
which is not public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you will not be able to protect
your investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So simple CBD and THC products,
they will not be the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is also a very, very important
message you have to take home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, complex proprietary
extracts or mixtures of cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe also terpenoids, other ingredients,
will be the API in this case, because this
[SPEAKER_01]: could be protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a generic is always possible if
you label only THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, again, is also important to get
more acceptance from the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this industry is not following the
rules and is not doing its homework,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will not be accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my anticipation for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis medicines are on the move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would like to get my slides,
please write me with this ICPC app and
[SPEAKER_01]: provide your email.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will be happy to send it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Markus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there were a few very
controversial points in this short
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I promise you, we come back to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have a little bit time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to ask Markus, the other
Markus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two Markus's here, so sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask Markus to present,
let me call it the Canadian way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me call it the Canadian way of dealing
with extracts and producing extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, Markus, Dr. Markus Roggen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have little time, so let me race
through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to take too many
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The slides are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take the QR code.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back and see all my other
presentations as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, who am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about inhalation,
and we're talking about production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because actually, I'm just a geek.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a German stereotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a PhD in chemistry, and I'm all
about process optimization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LinkedIn's up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to say hi, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower is king, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about the medical world and
the oils we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: In North America, flower is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either flower direct or pre-roll,
so the joint already done for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone cheats with THC, because
that's the number that everyone cares
[SPEAKER_00]: about, and that dictates the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minor cannabinoids, they are sexy,
they are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But THC is where it's at, and everyone
cheats.
[SPEAKER_00]: The producer, the testing lab,
and the suppliers.
Increasing it or decreasing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you want more bang for your buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, and these slides are just there,
so for you to have pointers to shout at
[SPEAKER_00]: me, I tell you they're wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we talk about other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone cheats on THC, and when you
actually test it, you see it, everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: inflates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, it's like, is that actually
true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you look at the whole market,
yes, higher THC, higher price.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did the effort, and we looked at it
on a per-state basis, and we did market
[SPEAKER_00]: segmentation in there, and that was just a
summer project by one of my students,
[SPEAKER_00]: undergrad students.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could show the relationship disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could only show like a market price
correlation there of like 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it must be something else that dictates
why cannabis consumers come back and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: buying cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an aroma that drives sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that the best-selling products
all skew sweeter than the mid-market
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is from a paper from Abstract
Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do really cool research, and they
find more compounds than just cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They find thiols, indols.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look like there's so much more to
discover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with chemistry, you might get a bit of
a business advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we are talking about cannabis,
we test the product and then give it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient, and the patient smokes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put heat and air at anything,
you change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the compliant testing does us a
disservice because we don't actually know
[SPEAKER_00]: what the patient or the recreation
consumer actually gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a robot that smokes joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my students are always disappointed to
find that out because they apply for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cool job they anticipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look at joints, and I want to know
how they behave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will show you, I do not care about
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if a politician says that THC
or that cannabis flower is becoming too
[SPEAKER_00]: potent because I can build you a stronger
or weaker joint just with chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at a joint, you find out
that the first few puffs you take have far
[SPEAKER_00]: less THC than the last puffs of the joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every consumer will tell you that they
love the beginning of the joint because
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually want the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes behave the other way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you prescribe a joint or smoking as
a medical use, you have a real problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also, and that's the graph on the
right, the right side, the grind size
[SPEAKER_00]: affects how much THC you inhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get more THC per puff with a finer
grind or more THC for the whole joint with
[SPEAKER_00]: a coarser grind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can build you a dog walker or a
sharing joint just with better
[SPEAKER_00]: architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: market cares about is infusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put oil in a joint, you get more THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue graphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the side show you that per puff,
there is no difference between a normal
[SPEAKER_00]: flower joint and an infused joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have way more puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can get through 160 puffs in
one sitting, good on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that's many of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is the difference with an infused
joint is you change the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene profile changes because the
infused oil brings flavor with it or
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's what the consumer is
after.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's always a but.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the toxicants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your oil infused joint is maybe not
the best thing for a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then talking about patients and
talking about the understanding a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: product, like some cannabis products turn
purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is that the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily for you, this is the only
slide you have to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to learn more,
I'm giving a chemistry lecture on Monday
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Technical University.
[SPEAKER_00]: But short to say, if you put cannabis as a
medical product, everyone talks about the
[SPEAKER_00]: antioxidant potential of that medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's antioxidant, it will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does oxidize under light and
aerobic conditions in your cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes haywire.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are compounds that we know are
toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is a host of things we
haven't even fished out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bathtub of new compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis should have a best before
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should maybe look at it what
happens after you dispense it or in that
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last talk was about flying it or driving
across the continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might also be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just quickly, it doesn't matter if your
cannabis is great, if you can't make money
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, because you won't survive into
the next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we look at the public data from
cannabis companies, they are pretty bad at
[SPEAKER_00]: producing cannabis at a cost-efficient
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we compare that to CPG or pharma,
what they want to be compared at,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were really bad in their profit
margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the geek in me.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we make this better?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a modern industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I heard the first industry of
the 21st century.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like act like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a bucket of alcohol is not your best
way of extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we build an AI to continuously optimize
the extraction process and not just have
[SPEAKER_00]: your extraction artist make the best
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, testing is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you take ideas from the COVID
crisis, batch testing, pool testing will
[SPEAKER_00]: cut your costs down and ensure that your
products go through without failure to the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in process analytics,
can you cut down the testing costs to like
[SPEAKER_00]: $0.30 a test?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have an algorithm for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so much more to discover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what is often just a fairy
dust of cannabis could actually be a
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool chemistry product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I have a few ideas for
research projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find me afterwards and email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Markus.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another five minutes for audience
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you see this is a very different
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Canadian approach and the German
approach is way different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The German approach is, in my eyes,
more scientific but less fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me say it like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in my eyes, medical cannabis is
something you cannot compare to other
[SPEAKER_02]: medicines because the development of its
legalization is also a fight of a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: single people who become okay who were
criminalized for years and they fought for
[SPEAKER_02]: their butts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember when I wrote about all
those cases in Germany, we had a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: cases, people being jailed in the early
2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were all afraid, all the people
were afraid that if one day cannabis has
[SPEAKER_02]: got to be legalized, that they cut it
apart and put it in a pill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is even if the rest of the
pharmaceutical industry works like this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I want to be an exception of the
rule because I received medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: from my doctor since 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if our industry puts it into pieces
and offers it to patients and it's a safe
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine, I have no problem with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't force people who don't want it
this way but the old way to do it the new
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why I said I appreciate the
German approach because it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific but we also need a little part
of the Canadian approach because in none
[SPEAKER_02]: of those two countries anybody,
any patient, ever died from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always said we need the mixture,
the Canadian experts and the German
[SPEAKER_02]: experts, they need to do exchange because
in Canada, in my eyes, it's not scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is also why patients are still
stigmatized like smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Germany, it's very, very scientific
and sometimes in my eyes, they overdo it
[SPEAKER_02]: and they just oversee the history,
the development of medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't steal the butts from the
patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're open for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check, check.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it for the panel one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have maybe one minute and I'm going to
be a little selfish.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had mentioned that you had an AI to do
rosin and resin and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that what you said to make the
concentrates and things that you were
[SPEAKER_03]: developing an AI?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems weird because I wouldn't want
a computer making my beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a self-enforcement Bayesian
algorithm based on random forest
[SPEAKER_00]: optimization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that English or German?
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is that if you do an extraction
or you make a rosin, you then judge it and
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's better or worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you change a parameter and then
you do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can do that with three,
four parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a computer, you can do that with
thousands and you can do that with
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of runs and you can learn from
other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you throw everything together,
it's basically just you thinking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem for years, compressed into
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not taking you out of the loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just speeding up your thought
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you trust computers to think for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is maybe beyond cannabis
because we're getting into an age of where
[SPEAKER_03]: computers are going to try to do every
little freaking thing for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're taking jobs from writers and all
this other stuff and artists and people
[SPEAKER_03]: want to write scripts with computers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's way beyond just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think like to Michael's point,
maybe we're just old dreadlocked hippies,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's still magic in the plant and
it can't always just be science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are the challenges that we're
having.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then we're agreed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it for the panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
