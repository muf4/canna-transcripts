[SPEAKER_01]: Make some noise if you're happy to be at
the ICBC, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, that's a good crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have to ask three times before I
get a response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we ask a second time how loud
we can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, make some noise if you're happy to be
at the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at the ICBC and I really like being
here in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have full respect for Berlin and
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, hey, hey, Liza!
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or as they say in the Schweiz,
Schweig.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean, Schweig?
[SPEAKER_01]: We love you Berlin and we're really happy
to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full respect for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a great event for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to get more people to be
quiet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you guys, we are the German cannabis
industry right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said it couldn't be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in a German prison 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: No!
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: A female prison is not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there for six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really bad, but I saw myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I changed my way of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, because I was in prison 12 years
ago, that's why everyone is here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make some noise if you're happy I went
to prison because you would be here now at
[SPEAKER_01]: the ICBC, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really fucking important that
nobody goes to prison for cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody needs to know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody needs to know that we have
to come together as an industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's one group that's really doing
that in Germany and they're the ICBC's
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest strategic partner, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're an amazing group and what they've
done is they've created a lobby to push
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have medical, we will have legalization
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make some noise for the Deutsche
Hanfaban, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Denk auf euch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do not belong to this organization
and you want to do business in Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: you must belong to this organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have helped me immensely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their fearless leader is somebody who I
admire, not just more than anybody in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, but more than anybody in the
cannabis industry almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an amazing person doing a lot of
things for the industry and he is the
[SPEAKER_01]: driving force for legalization for
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, give it up for Georg Murth,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, say some words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, say some words.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have the nicest company,
the wealthiest company and the most
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful company of all and that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we do is making a little bit
united stance.
[SPEAKER_00]: As he said, we are the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need proper regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see here the German government doesn't
get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to give out licenses to produce
cannabis in a fair way.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, it's completely trashed and
in that situation, you can have the best
[SPEAKER_00]: company of all, but you won't get anywhere
with that government.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do is take a tiny proportion of
the big money you move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us do that fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fight for proper regulations for
everybody, for patients, for consumers and
[SPEAKER_00]: for the business and then may the best one
begin and win the race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a booth here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can talk to us in English also.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the ones who are already sponsors,
the last little message.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't pay Alex to be here as sponsor
of the VIP reception.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked us to present this here because
he likes our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent 100% of our money for our lobby
work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a nice conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make some noise for George Burke,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
