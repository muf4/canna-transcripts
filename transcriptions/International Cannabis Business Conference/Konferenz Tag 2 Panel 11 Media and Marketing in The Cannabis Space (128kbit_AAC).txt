[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the warm applause.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the very last and quite
familiar panel, which I'm going to open
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And first I'm going to introduce to you
Marke Knitta.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of our panelists.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there they come.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eugenio and Simon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will come to those two later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marke Knitta is a part of the German law
firm SKW Schwarz and certified expert for
[SPEAKER_04]: IP additional.
[SPEAKER_04]: She is head of the cannabis practice group
at SKW Schwarz.
[SPEAKER_04]: Margaret, please tell us a little bit more
about your cannabis activity within your
[SPEAKER_04]: company as a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already was a speaker two years ago,
so I'm glad to be here again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm stepping in for a colleague
he unfortunately got ill last night and is
[SPEAKER_02]: lying down with a flu.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right, SKW Schwarz is a German based
law firm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have four offices.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are 130 lawyers, full service.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got into the cannabis field in 2017 when
medical cannabis became legal in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I had the opportunity to
administer a big trademark portfolio from
[SPEAKER_02]: a cannabis based firm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really exciting because
obviously back then everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, it was a new field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had the opportunity to get the whole
development from the start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by now we are not only doing IP.
[SPEAKER_02]: My specialty is IP and advertisement law,
but also M&A or licensing, procurement,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Margaret.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking forward to your expertise
later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I have to say hello to Eugenio Garcia
first.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's founder of Cannabis Now, which is one
of the biggest English speaking cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: publications worldwide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how did cannabis now develop within the
last years since the legalization in the
[SPEAKER_04]: states or since the legalization of many
states?
[SPEAKER_04]: In the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you and welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate being here with you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started Cannabis Now in 2009 in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It originally was developed as a medical
journal for cannabis enthusiasts and users
[SPEAKER_00]: with a strong political focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time there was a lot of media
available, but mainly it was focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: either the unfortunate terminology of a
stoner or the breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of European media that
was very focused on breeding, seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was the traditional
publications that were really focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: the aggressive use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we believed that there was a new
consumer coming in the future that would
[SPEAKER_00]: be an enlightened enthusiast, somebody
that would really care about education,
[SPEAKER_00]: about plant medicine, about spirituality,
about health and wellness, and about
[SPEAKER_00]: moving the industry forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we created Cannabis Now to be that
voice for the new cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew we were early, but we didn't
quite realize how early we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fast forward to 2023 here in Berlin,
we're still about only halfway through the
[SPEAKER_00]: journey of where I think we will end up as
a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as cannabis media expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cannabis Now is a print digital social
media and in-person media group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we mainly operate in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in the only magazine in airports in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in 58 airports nationwide in
Hudson News, which is a testament to the
[SPEAKER_00]: type of content that we produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a social media community of
just over four million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for being here with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Eugenio.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last guest I have to introduce to
you is Simon Espinosa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: My Spanish is not so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm glad to have my second panel with
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I already had the panel before,
which was, we really enjoyed it last year,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how did things develop with your
publication called En Vola or En Vola ever
[SPEAKER_04]: since?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we started this community.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not a company when it started.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has always been a community and started
10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that has evolved to become what
is now, which is the most watched cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: media in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started, we're based in Chile,
but now we have outgrown our frontiers and
[SPEAKER_05]: have reached new communities across the
globe, all in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina,
Peru, and surprisingly enough,
[SPEAKER_05]: Florida and California, where half of the
people speak Spanish and nobody's
[SPEAKER_05]: communicating cannabis in Spanish,
which was a great opportunity for us to
[SPEAKER_05]: fill that gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we do is we communicate
educational and scientific content in a
[SPEAKER_05]: fun way.
[SPEAKER_05]: All our hosts of our shows in social media
are stand-up comedians or really funny
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the least funny at all, so I'm sorry
about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some jokes though we can share if
you want, but yeah, that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We try to communicate in a fun way,
in a very approachable way and kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing cannabis to a mainstream place
where stigma does not longer exist and
[SPEAKER_05]: where cannabis users are free to be funny
and intelligent at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: So education, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So education is a very important part of
cannabis marketing, I would agree on
[SPEAKER_04]: because you always have to justify
cannabis marketing in a way and it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: best way to justify marketing for a drug,
of course, is education.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're an online platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do online work mostly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Eugenio, you're doing classical print
magazine as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you're active online,
but you're doing a classical print
[SPEAKER_04]: magazine, which everybody says at the
moment, oh no, no, don't invest in print
[SPEAKER_04]: magazines.
[SPEAKER_04]: That does not work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you agree on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree that if you do anything poorly,
it will not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also agree that print medium,
whether it's books or newspapers or
[SPEAKER_00]: magazines or whatever you're doing,
is more challenging than it's ever been.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, from a technical perspective,
high quality niche, which is small
[SPEAKER_00]: publications, are actually on the
increase, at least in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to get too esoteric with everybody,
but we all have these with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the digital revolution is fully in our
system right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all spend a significant amount of
time on our phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a quarter of the audience right
now is looking at their phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are absorbing media in five,
four, three different ways all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is going to end up happening,
which has already started to happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: is people are gonna make the conscious
decision, and they are already
[SPEAKER_00]: subconsciously making the decision to go
back to non-digital, non-screen forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: entertainment and media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our brains are not gonna stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're now these humans that absorb media,
and it's part of who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now as a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our brain still wants to be entertained
and educated, but the drain that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting from our TV screens that we have
in our pockets is now pushing us back to
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional and different forms of
interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in-person is coming back, and print is
coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a more basic level, if you have a
print magazine that is telling very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very dynamic, interesting stories,
and is made in a way that will hold up
[SPEAKER_00]: over time, that is not just meant to be
thrown away, but maybe archived or put on
[SPEAKER_00]: a coffee table, and that will last,
that is what is being successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't hit those marks,
it's very easy not to be successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the truth is, no matter if you publish
as a print magazine or you publish online,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to get some revenue by
advertisement.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to, you know that, you know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm glad we have an advertised expert
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I have to tell that to our
American and Canadian audience or
[SPEAKER_04]: non-German audience that you may not know,
or maybe you know, that in Germany,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're not allowed to advertise for
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recreational cannabis is illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how can you advertise for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what your customers ask you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, maybe I go one step back
before we go into what is allowed to
[SPEAKER_02]: advertise and what is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some of you, it might be obvious,
but sometimes it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to share that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very important that you get brand
protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know in the US, it's not possible to
get a federal wide trademark protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Germany or in Europe, that's
different since 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be the first you should
think when you come to Europe to get brand
[SPEAKER_02]: protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in the beginning it was hard,
but nowadays it's not a problem,
[SPEAKER_02]: even for goods and services for
recreational cannabis, which I must say,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's astonishes me because it is illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you do get trademark protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: We file it all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that changed totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing you have to be aware of is
use trademarks which do not have the word
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis or something related like weed or
pot or whatever in there because the
[SPEAKER_02]: European Court of Justice still holds that
this infringes public morality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't get a trademark protection
for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But apart from that, go for trademark
protection the first step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the next thing is can you advertise?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm astonished when my US and Canadian
clients tell me, well, this is what we did
[SPEAKER_02]: in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please tell me if this is possible in
Germany as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I have to decline.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very strict.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually when we talk about cannabis,
well, cannabis we cannot, as you just
[SPEAKER_02]: said.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no advertisement allowed at all
because recreational cannabis is illegal
[SPEAKER_02]: and medical cannabis you're not allowed to
advertise in Germany because it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical preparation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have is CBD products.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're checking, claims for CBD
products here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is usually, what we see is that
the industry wants to make some beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: health related claim and that's a big
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, makes you easy to sleep or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it actually does, because the courts
then say, well, we want scientific proof
[SPEAKER_02]: for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't seen any court case law yet
in Germany which would hold that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the end, there was, at least according
to the judgment, there was not sufficient
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, health related advertisement is
not possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I'm not allowed to talk about the
beneficials of a plant or the beneficials
[SPEAKER_04]: of the medicine, can I talk about my brand
openly?
[SPEAKER_04]: May I mention my brand if it's not related
to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: So may I advertise for my brand if I don't
advertise for the specific medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we do see legal advertisements,
of course, but just don't say like,
[SPEAKER_02]: anything health related.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's possible to advertise it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I want to bring in the medical cannabis
strain in the German pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_04]: I could not mention the, I will not
mention the specific cannabis brand,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I can mention my company brand when I
do advertise for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you stated earlier, medical
cannabis, you cannot advertise it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you can is provide information about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like guidance, something like you said,
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're not allowed to promote a
specific medical cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not allowed to hire an agency to
promote it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can, but then you might get
sued.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do I do that in Chile?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I advertise for medical cannabis in
Chile?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first of all, the regulation down
there, it's not as strict as the German
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing is as strict as German regulation,
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that being said, all the content that
we've done, it's educational and for
[SPEAKER_05]: educational purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to be also very, very careful
on what specific words you use when you
[SPEAKER_05]: refer to certain, I don't know if you're
going to talk about chemical profiles,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're going to talk about effects,
or any of those, you have to be very
[SPEAKER_05]: careful on the information you provide.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to make disclosures first.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to take care of yourself and
generate this sort of ecosystem in which
[SPEAKER_05]: you let your viewers and your audience
know what's the purpose, the specific
[SPEAKER_05]: purpose of every publication first.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to nest them under this
umbrella of protection, 18 plus content,
[SPEAKER_05]: and educational content, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after that, you have to be in charge
of, like, do a follow-up to your content,
[SPEAKER_05]: because things change.
[SPEAKER_05]: And something that you published,
like, years ago in YouTube channel can be,
[SPEAKER_05]: or can raise the red flag by certain
specific institutions, and then you have
[SPEAKER_05]: to react to that before you get in legal
trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: I experienced that a lot of time also,
as on my YouTube channel I experienced,
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to agree, I experienced that a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times that I got banned,
or I got strikes, and it was not reasoned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to contact YouTube a lot of times,
and they just don't answer why they give
[SPEAKER_04]: you the block, or why they block you,
why they give you the strike.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to find it out yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time my YouTube channel was blocked,
it was quite interesting, was because I
[SPEAKER_04]: had a contract with a seed company
advertising on my channel, but for already
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And overnight, YouTube changed rules,
and the seed advertising was illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although seeds were not illegal to
advertise in the countries where they are
[SPEAKER_04]: illegal, and I advertised for a Spanish
seed company.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was for sure not about German law,
but overnight I got two strikes,
[SPEAKER_04]: and my channel was nearly blocked,
because I had a very short advertisement
[SPEAKER_04]: for seeds in the beginning of my of each
episode.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to cut off the seed advertisement
of each episode, and I'm still working on
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: May I add something to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very interesting point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make clear that,
in fact, if you choose to use one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: social media platforms, it's their
playground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they make their own laws, which is
legal, and with posting something and
[SPEAKER_02]: agreeing to their terms of condition,
and you agree to it, so even though it
[SPEAKER_02]: might be legal under German law or
whatever, it's their own law.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never complained about it, because I
know this has nothing to do with freedom
[SPEAKER_04]: of press.
[SPEAKER_04]: Freedom of press I have on my own
homepage.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't reach so many people on my own
homepage.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I go to YouTube, if I enter a bar,
and if the owner of the bar, he doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: like my face, he just can ask me to go
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same with YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: Freedom of press is nothing which has
anything to do with YouTube, especially
[SPEAKER_04]: when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree to their rules, and if I break the
rules and they make the rules,
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to draw the consequences.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is why I never thought of suing
YouTube, and I've had this problem since
[SPEAKER_04]: 2006.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first episode on YouTube was blocked in
2007, because I showed how to grow peppers
[SPEAKER_04]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was just pepper growing indoor,
and it was blocked, and I got striked for
[SPEAKER_04]: growing peppers on the light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry for interrupting.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no worries.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way we understand this is there are
these guidelines.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how they call it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rules of a certain specific social
media platform.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got myself into a conference of media.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not supposed to be there,
but I got myself in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could talk to someone that worked in
YouTube, in a high level position,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I got myself the meeting, and then
they explained very clearly why those
[SPEAKER_05]: guidelines are not clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the issue with social media
platforms.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, they can change their guidelines
without any previous warn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Secondary, those guidelines are quite
often general, so that they can decide in
[SPEAKER_05]: different aspects on how to proceed
according to themselves and not a third
[SPEAKER_05]: party.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they do say, though, that the
promotion of consumption of any regulated
[SPEAKER_05]: substance, it's not allowed in their
platforms.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we've found out is that you have
to be prepared to get strikes.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are in the cannabis industry,
no matter what your strategy is,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can get your YouTube channel banned,
your Instagram account taken away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the only answer to that is to have
your own strong platforms or your own
[SPEAKER_05]: platforms as strong as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your website, you can say anything you
want on your website.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody will take it down, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there are other platforms that
are weed-friendly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Twitter, LinkedIn, those platforms.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can publish anything you want as long
as it's not something that's offensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that some of what you're
saying is not only true, but it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: indicative of the future of marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing social media, doing your content on
other people's platforms, we're almost at
[SPEAKER_00]: the point where that's the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're talking about is the
future, but we can still use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a community like ours, which has
four million followers, it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous for us not to try to monetize
that, but we know that we don't own it,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we put very little investment into it,
but we do it as value added for our
[SPEAKER_00]: clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will charge clients money for
marketing and services that we control,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as a free value add, we will say,
and we will publish it on our YouTube,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we will publish it on our social
media, but we can't make it our core
[SPEAKER_00]: business because it would jeopardize our
business too much to rely on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you advertise, or how do companies
advertise for medical cannabis in the U
[SPEAKER_04]: .S.?
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about Germany, we talked about
Chile, but how do they, how is it
[SPEAKER_04]: advertised?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer depends on which state you're
in because the United States is much like
[SPEAKER_00]: 50, 52 different countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does depend on what state,
and sometimes it depends on what county,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sometimes it depends on what city
you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: has actually very unrestricted laws,
but some places like Florida, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: has very restricted laws, but I actually
believe that the first place that a
[SPEAKER_00]: company should look to invest to promote
their brand in media and marketing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is a little, might seem not
natural for marketers like us to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: but earned media and journalism is
actually the first frontier, I believe,
[SPEAKER_00]: of a positive marketing and media strategy
and then you can back that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earned media is first, and then you
back it up and you reinforce it with paid
[SPEAKER_00]: media, not the other way around,
and earned media is what you do for
[SPEAKER_00]: getting free stories based on your value
to the community and to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you invest in quality, in your own
story, in your own brand recognition,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then hire or have your own team have
relationships with the journalists,
[SPEAKER_00]: the independent journalists, who they're
not that many out there anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there still are some.
[SPEAKER_00]: One over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: To tell your story in an authentic way,
you can get more value from that almost
[SPEAKER_00]: than any dollar that you can pay,
and there's no laws against that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would agree on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I recently did a job for like a Florida
company called Fluent.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: They own like 17 locations.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are publicly traded.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're under a lot of scrutiny from like
several local institutions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is one example.
[SPEAKER_05]: We created content that would explain
people how to get a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: license in Spanish, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we did for that community,
but we couldn't advertise anything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was a very tricky how to get there,
but it's already published, and you can
[SPEAKER_05]: see it in our YouTube channel,
how to get a medical cannabis prescription
[SPEAKER_05]: in Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: And where to buy it is not set,
but it's sponsored by Fluent Cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So their KPI there was to acquire new
patients, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to get to new patients,
but they cannot do it in conventional
[SPEAKER_05]: ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of a service that we
provide for the industry as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope it helps.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we see the way to... Thank you for
that only applause.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one else, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: No more applause.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that laugh.
[SPEAKER_05]: No more laughs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the least expected minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we can see cannabis marketing
differs from country to country,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say Sheila and the US is more
related.
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany has a kind of a special role.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if customers ask you, how should I
build up my company to build up a good
[SPEAKER_04]: brand?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you recommend a customer of the
cannabis company, except not using the
[SPEAKER_04]: word cannabis in the word, in the company
name, or not any cannabis related term in
[SPEAKER_04]: the company name.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you build up a company profile when
it comes also to not advertisement,
[SPEAKER_04]: but let me call it branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually that's not so different as
from other branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more a name speaks for the goods and
services it's supposed to be used for,
[SPEAKER_02]: the better it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other hand, the more difficult
it is to get brand protection for it,
[SPEAKER_02]: because then it might be purely
descriptive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to find with your team,
marketing team, a strong brand,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is, however, you get brand
protection for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it shouldn't have the word cannabis in
it because of morality issues,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it shouldn't be purely descriptive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, well, then it depends where do
you want to go, which are your markets,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that is trademark strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like usually my clients come from the US
and Canada, so they already have their
[SPEAKER_02]: marks there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they come to Europe, that's what
we usually see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go with a so-called
Madrid-Portugal international trademark
[SPEAKER_02]: filings, but they all come from over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we handle the trademarks from
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we also see, especially the
Canadian and the US, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: because they don't have any trademarks
federal-wise in the US, they go for
[SPEAKER_02]: European protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the so-called European trademark
office in Alicante in Spain, which is very
[SPEAKER_02]: convenient.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make one filing and you have
protection in all the 27 member states.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's quite good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you need Switzerland as well,
which is another story then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's quite interesting because
that's a total difference and a different
[SPEAKER_04]: approach than in other countries because
it's restricted so highly here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: But would you say, are there a lot of
suing cases that companies get sued
[SPEAKER_04]: because they do not stick to the rules?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I hear that from time to time.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I can tell you, I've already seen a lot
of companies just not sticking to the
[SPEAKER_04]: rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: How probable is it to be sued for this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I think that might be also a
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: But please correct me if I'm wrong to like
the US or other countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We here in Germany have a really strong
consumer protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a lot of consumer protection
associations, and they take those cases to
[SPEAKER_02]: court.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we see, at least in the cannabis
field, I'm not aware of any case where one
[SPEAKER_02]: competitor sued another, which would be
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just go their own ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not that kind of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not that kind of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wouldn't sue each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: We already have too many problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have other industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sue each other all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same with the influencer
marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also very strict rules in
Germany, but the influencers, they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: sue each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have those associations and they go
to court.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing is, which is probably
new for you, in Germany it's all case law.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about health claims or
influencer marketing, all these
[SPEAKER_02]: advertisement related topics, we don't
have an advertisement agency like in the
[SPEAKER_02]: US, which then go after you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the courts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you always need somebody who sues you
for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as nobody sues you,
I guess that's why we see so much on
[SPEAKER_02]: social media, which is probably not legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just continue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it comes to the fines in the
so-called, I have to use the German term,
[SPEAKER_04]: Heilmittelwerbegesetz, they are quite
high, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a special law which regulates
advertisement for not pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: preparations, but for anything which is
beneficial for your health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says that whatever you claim needs
to be true, it's obvious, but also when
[SPEAKER_02]: you say something health related,
you need the scientific proof for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very high burden.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole CBD market is suffering from it,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from this higher hurdle, I think you
can tell stories about the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD entrepreneurs are suffering from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, yeah, it's a shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and to speak to the CBD market,
it might be suffering because of legality
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, but also one of the things to
remember with any brand is you have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: true just in general to keep your
customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can legally say whatever you want,
but if your product does not stand up,
[SPEAKER_00]: to what you're saying, you won't be in
business for long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the US CBD market,
about 80% of it has disappeared in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last three years, not because of any
increased regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just people are either transitioning
to different, more advanced cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: or THC, and or a lot of the brands said,
hey, this will do this for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after spending a certain amount of
money, it did not do that and they lost
[SPEAKER_00]: the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So legal or not legal, marketing and media
and brand loyalty starts with the value
[SPEAKER_00]: you give to your customer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely, I would absolutely agree on
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simon, if it comes to Sheila, how,
you have a medical cannabis program in
[SPEAKER_04]: Sheila since?
[SPEAKER_05]: Very recently, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, like a couple of months ago,
we legalized medical cannabis use with a
[SPEAKER_05]: medical prescription.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, we're very happy about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good joke.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll tell that to the camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel, do you already feel that when
it comes to a publication that there's an
[SPEAKER_04]: interest on advertisement or on
introducing on educating people on medical
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis more than it was before now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it started very quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the next day after the law was set in
place formally, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's this whole process that needs to
be published in an official journal and
[SPEAKER_05]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the very next day we start getting
calls from new dispensaries that were not
[SPEAKER_05]: actually legal formally, but they know
that they're protected by the medical
[SPEAKER_05]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're basically associations that
would take medical prescriptions and then
[SPEAKER_05]: provide a service accordingly.
[SPEAKER_05]: To what the medical prescription says.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we started getting inquiries on how
should they promote themselves in this new
[SPEAKER_05]: space, in this new, so we had to basically
open a new area, a new branch of our
[SPEAKER_05]: company that would only assess them,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: On how to properly engage with us or with
any other media company or agency.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a huge increase in interest in
this area.
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be taken care of.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a lot to say still that we
don't know how it will unfold,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we do know that there's already a
certain framework for what you can do and
[SPEAKER_05]: cannot do with regulated substances.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are sticking to that frame until
there is like a new updates on cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so far we're advising them to promote
the same way they would do with Vicodin,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're doing Vicodin shows now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very profitable.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know is a word I hear very often
when it comes to cannabis regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: In every country, especially also in
Germany, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very common phrase when it comes
to, we want to regulate cannabis within
[SPEAKER_04]: this and this time, but we don't know how
to do that yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hear that in Germany every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, which on the other hand,
of course, creates gray areas because no
[SPEAKER_04]: country decided to legalize from one day
to the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going from a black to white market within
with a state of decriminalization as
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany plans means also to accept the
gray market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a lot of people think of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going from white from black to white in
the middle is gray.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we decriminalize, which is not
legalized, we accept the gray market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody, California did that,
even Switzerland does that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They accept gray areas when it comes to
home growing, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: Switzerland is accepting gray areas since
over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how is that for a lawyer in the
industry where you have to work with gray
[SPEAKER_04]: areas?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I wanted to know from you,
Margaret.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we are of course trying to solve
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be not just to show our clients
what they cannot do, but what they can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this specific field, at the end,
we tell them what the law says,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we tell them what the risk is if
they break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a very good four minutes and 20
seconds or less expression of a gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real example.
[SPEAKER_00]: In March of 2021, a lawyer sent a letter
to the DEA in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, hey, there's a gray area in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we sell seeds in the United States?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: DEA, which is the federal government of
the US, regulatory, can we do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: A certain amount of time goes by,
and the DEA responds with a letter saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, lawyer, the DEA deems seeds as hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are no longer deemed a controlled
substance in our purview.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will not be going after seeds or
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a food commodity, and they are a
hemp product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lawyer published that letter on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine months later, Cannabis Now was
working with a client called Royal Queen
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds, who is a genetics seed company from
Europe who had decided to come to the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States because of that letter,
because it was safe to now sell outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: a gray market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a little gray, but a lot less
gray after that legal letter was
[SPEAKER_00]: published.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we teamed up with them to take over
the New York City Times Square building at
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 for an advertisement but we did it in
a very unique way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did was we teamed up with Royal
Queen Seeds to celebrate 420, and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: not an advertisement to, hey, buy our
seeds and grow marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was let's celebrate the fact that we
can grow cannabis legally in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States using these seeds brought to you by
Royal Queen Seeds and Cannabis Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a party in Times Square at 420,
gave out 200 free joints or more,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the news station showed up and we got
over four million eyeballs on that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't pay for that kind of
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really good example of how we
identified a gray market that had become a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot less gray, and for the lack of a
better word, exploited it for the benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: of everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it always takes a while till a black
market becomes white.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say if you don't accept the
time, and the gray area takes,
[SPEAKER_04]: we are in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think nobody likes what's going on
in Thailand right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you legalize one from one day to the
other overnight, if you legalize
[SPEAKER_04]: overnight, this is also a big chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a legal perspective though,
or from a media perspective, I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: also with the gray area, if we look at the
gray area and then we push on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically, we might actually find out
or get a response that it's less gray than
[SPEAKER_00]: we thought, or actually turn it from gray
to green.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is what I think we should all
work on because Germany wanted to legalize
[SPEAKER_04]: without a gray area, and they worked on it
for two years, and then they understood,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, we have to accept this gray area
with the three plants and 25 grams,
[SPEAKER_04]: because everybody knows three plants does
not mean you can grow a lot of cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: out of three plants, more than your own
need.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of course, they accept gray areas,
and they found out after two years of
[SPEAKER_04]: discussing with lawyers and checking AU
law and federal law that they have to
[SPEAKER_04]: accept this gray area if they want to have
a proper legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have one, I'm sorry that I
interrupted you, but I think we have one
[SPEAKER_04]: more minute for question if anybody from
the audience wants to ask a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: No jokes.
No applause.
[SPEAKER_05]: No applause, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it for the panel, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it for Engajo.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more time, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for you, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: No applause.
[SPEAKER_03]: No applause.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Lukman Roy, I'm a
filmmaker, and like Mika, I'm also in the
[SPEAKER_01]: realm of thinking about ways of
collaborating with brands and knowing that
[SPEAKER_01]: this issue is all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really like the last example you gave
because it's actually an example of how to
[SPEAKER_01]: empower the issue and not standing there
as a sponsor, right, but as a collaborator
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to know of you what other
examples in the last few months or years
[SPEAKER_01]: come to your mind when it comes to very
creative way of pushing the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: subject out in society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I will say that a minor example of
that is what we're doing here today at
[SPEAKER_00]: ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with Jason Washington,
who's in the front row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with my wife and my baby boy
who's over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are here, we're filming a
documentary on cannabis culture and
[SPEAKER_00]: education in Berlin and in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've invested our time and our money
to document what we're all doing here
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will turn into a film project that
we will then distribute for free to people
[SPEAKER_00]: who want to learn about not everyone can
be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a very unique, important group
that a lot of people wish they could be
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether it's time or health or money,
they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a really real world example
of us capturing this moment and then
[SPEAKER_00]: distributing it globally for people to
create change with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally think when it comes to that,
that aspect, we should focus on prevention
[SPEAKER_04]: and youth protection because this is a
very important topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it comes to people who do not
want to have a cannabis industry in this
[SPEAKER_04]: country, this is also, this is always the
topic where it comes to.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to protect youth and we cannot
protect our youth with legalizing
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we do a proper harm reduction work,
if you do a proper safer use work,
[SPEAKER_04]: it will be much easier for the whole
industry to have revenue here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you really give them good
prevention and protection concept for our
[SPEAKER_04]: youth, for our youngsters, because this is
what society is afraid of.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a win-win situation because we
protect the youth and we help our industry
[SPEAKER_04]: to act more freely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the last word I wanted to say
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should not neglect that political issue
of youth protection, safer use,
[SPEAKER_04]: and harm reduction, because the whole
industry will profit from it when it will
[SPEAKER_04]: become a big cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for being at the ICP.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for all the panelists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all so very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more time for Henio and Simone and
Margaret and Michael Knoth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
