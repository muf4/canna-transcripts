[SPEAKER_01]: I decided that we wanted to attend the
ICBC in Berlin specifically because the
[SPEAKER_01]: European market is truly coming online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany is today the most important market
in the cannabis industry in Europe and so
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to the capital Berlin with ICBC was
a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: ICBC and Berlin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect match.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think of Berlin, when I think of
Germany, I think of organized,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of professional, I think of brave
and ICBC delivered all of those things in
[SPEAKER_01]: spades.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here at ICBC for three reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first reason was to get as much
information as possible from the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are already in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hear from all the success stories,
hear from all the failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What ICBC has done is I've met people in
the finance industry, I've met people in
[SPEAKER_00]: the legal industry, I've met people in the
regulatory framework and these people have
[SPEAKER_00]: been able to tell us what's possible,
what is not possible, what would work for
[SPEAKER_00]: a country like Zimbabwe, what wouldn't
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to craft a national cannabis
master plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met the parties that can make that
happen and make it happen faster than it
[SPEAKER_00]: would normally take.
[SPEAKER_00]: ICBC is probably the best conference I've
ever attended and I've been going to
[SPEAKER_00]: conferences since I was 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I say that is the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew in three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably grew more than I have in the
last three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The networking opportunities are just
unparalleled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met people that I wouldn't normally
meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a chance to liaise with
professionals in the industry that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no other way I would have had to see these
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have access to billions of dollars in
funding right now because of coming to
[SPEAKER_00]: such a conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made the sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_00]: ICBC is worth it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth it for the people of Zimbabwe
and we will reap the benefits of my
[SPEAKER_00]: presence here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ICBC after parties are always fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you expect from the cannabis industry
and always elegant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always get exactly what we expect which
is it's a sophisticatedly professionally
[SPEAKER_01]: run conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very rich attendance in terms of diversity
as far as just people and cultures but
[SPEAKER_01]: also the areas of the industry that are
represented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always very intelligent discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: you you
