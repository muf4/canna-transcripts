[SPEAKER_01]: So I think for ICBC what you can expect to
see at a show like this is a good
[SPEAKER_01]: connection between distribution,
packaging, I want to say regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance, retail, wholesale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to have all of these people all
in one room and all in one space so you
[SPEAKER_01]: can kind of connect the dots and figure
out how your business can really excel
[SPEAKER_01]: within the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really what I love about this show is the
interconnections between businesses to
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses having meaningful conversations
and relationships to figure out what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in the industry, whether it be in
Germany or whether it be an entire EU or
[SPEAKER_01]: from different countries altogether,
different continents altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had great discussions here,
I've learned a lot here, this is the kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of stuff that I come to ICBC for so having
a great time with it I would highly
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend to anyone looking to exhibit at
a show like this, do it, don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: second-guess it, it's a great connection
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been so great to come to ICBC what
an incredible networking opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have met fantastic, smart, successful
people from all over the world and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them I'm really keen to want to work with.
One thing that we know for sure is we love
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everybody.
