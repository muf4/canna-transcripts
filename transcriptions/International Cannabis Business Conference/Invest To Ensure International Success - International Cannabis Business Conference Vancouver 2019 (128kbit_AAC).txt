[SPEAKER_00]: Speak easily, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: No podium and a hard act to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a fun one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Main thing, like since we're in Canada,
I'm going to try not to offend Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though there's a lot of examples of
what not to do here, just like Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to be very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know lunch is coming, so I'll try to
do a high level, keep things brief and
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about a Canadian
company, how are you going to be relevant
[SPEAKER_00]: in this big change?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your place?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start with a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a CPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must use these professionals in
everything you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you're growing this industry,
this is going to be a normal business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't set up yourself to be a
normal business, you will be crushed as
[SPEAKER_00]: litigation is skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick background on myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started in the cannabis industry in
Colorado, 2006, after the military.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the entire cannabis industry
emerge from the first commercial sales in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, which we kind of helped to start
with medical and then the first adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: market, scaled and we've worked in 34
states, worked in 16 countries already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a pretty good idea of what's
going on in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, we're not guessing when
it comes to some of these countries and
[SPEAKER_00]: policies that we're going to go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I started, I'm a farm kid from
Wisconsin, really deep focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, which is what we started in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now having worked in all sectors of
the industry, a lot of the truths that
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll share about Canada are very,
very similar to other markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing you have to remember is that
US cannabis and Canadian cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't translate to international
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't just think you're going to
launch some gummy bear brand here and then
[SPEAKER_00]: be selling in Germany next year,
which is pretty, pretty important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we think about the world and what
happened from California Compassionate
[SPEAKER_00]: Care Act in 1996, how that scaled and
what's happened, it's pretty fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible to think that we actually have
a bona fide industry today that's not only
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupting, but interrupting normal
business processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you're looking at the rest of the
world, a lot of like that black area
[SPEAKER_00]: still, it's only a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to be Finland producing
for Finland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be this continual
rollout model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can you produce lower cost at the
same standards to achieve like a global
[SPEAKER_00]: domination?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the big players that
haven't gotten into this space yet are
[SPEAKER_00]: really looking at is the scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we're going to cover some on the
global side, some on the US side,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some on the Canada side, and really
think of how it all comes together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key difference here, like I have a
consulting company, we have venture
[SPEAKER_00]: capital companies, now do private equity
international.
[SPEAKER_00]: The really similarity here in everything
is capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without it, you're screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how to actually get institutional
capital or private investors is
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone went public here in Canada,
good for a few, hasn't worked out for a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of them, and based on a few of the
things that we'll talk about, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to work for many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So private capital as you're scaling is
so, so critical to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big thing about international,
like I said, it's not the same as the US
[SPEAKER_00]: or Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Canada and Uruguay very ballsy in
legalizing a narcotic for adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And God bless Canada for having the first
mover advantage in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Health Canada had no idea how to go
from medical to recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been one of the biggest
catastrophes, I'd say, in our industry
[SPEAKER_00]: since the inception, like bigger than vape
things, bigger than like children getting
[SPEAKER_00]: products or wrongful deaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're going international,
you have to know the rules to play this
[SPEAKER_00]: game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And international policy when it comes to
the single convention, how the UN is
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at this, how the WHO is looking at
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know those rules and you're
planning global partnerships, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: just about some country in Zimbabwe or
Swaziland or Uganda or some Georgia rec
[SPEAKER_00]: play that's going to be a big,
big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be compliant with these drug
policies because if not, they just won't
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMP is a big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone talks about it, thinks it's so,
so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Health Canada, there were five,
maybe six companies that are now getting
[SPEAKER_00]: GMP compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not just about doing GMP to sell
to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to make sure that you don't
have risks and liabilities as your
[SPEAKER_00]: business scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And GMP is just one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The really important one, if you're in
cultivation, GACP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone thinks GAP is so important,
but it's actually GACP, Good Agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: Collection Practices, that most of these
businesses are founded on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're doing anything
international, GAP, GACP, GMP,
[SPEAKER_00]: GDP, and GLP for laboratories,
critical because that's the big challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: here that you're going to see in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about the US quick,
which many Canadian companies are coming
[SPEAKER_00]: down to launch into Canada because they're
highly capitalized from their public
[SPEAKER_00]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think in the United States,
there are 47 of 50 states that have some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of medical cannabis law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 11 states that have adult use,
31 that have some sort of commercial sales
[SPEAKER_00]: for medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's over half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the previous gentleman said,
like once there's 25 rec states,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's only a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to know in the United States,
medical legalization will happen first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because everyone thinks Trump's
going to legalize it to try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: reelected, even if he tried, there are
many steps and policies that would have to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen before that would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So focus on medical legalization in the US
first, followed by an adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a question of if this is
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the United States with Colorado,
right where we were and started to now
[SPEAKER_00]: think of all of those blue states that
adult use is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, Michigan is slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois is about to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maine and Massachusetts kind of messed up
programs initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over 92 percent of all of the revenue
in the United States reported today is
[SPEAKER_00]: from the adult use side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a disabled vet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I got into the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to remember the medical side
from taxes and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here here, even in Canada,
the medical industry, who's talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares about it anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the medical is the foot into the door
into the adult use market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen it in the United States 100
percent of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were medical licensed, you have
some sort of first preference to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds similar to Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big opportunities in the United States
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a closed market, but it's state
by state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until interstate commerce is allowed
from federal legalization, I can't produce
[SPEAKER_00]: in Oregon and then ship it to another
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have new companies in each
state, new business partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's residency requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at Arkansas, five cultivation
processing licenses for three million
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that was Colorado, equivalent,
you'd have 10 growers for Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers, that's about one point four
billion of the addressable revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when there's a limited market and you
can get into it, you have to get into it
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the big ones right now in the United
States, Illinois, when you think about
[SPEAKER_00]: that map first adult use in the Midwest
and Michigan was a very we call it like
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the dirty seven states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have the cards on the wall and
like not sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, of course, like four billion
dollars of cannabis were flooding out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan every year to the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing in Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think Illinois adult use is going
to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Major Canadian companies are applying
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be very, very challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 12 million people, adult use,
social consumption lounges near the
[SPEAKER_00]: borders, it's going to be phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also have to think about the
neighboring countries or states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like here in Canada, you've got 90% of
your population within 10 miles of the U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S.
[SPEAKER_00]: border.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 90% of all Canadians live in
three territories that have shitty,
[SPEAKER_00]: shitty laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like Quebec, Montreal,
Ontario, and Great British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've missed out on five, six billion
dollars in revenue just from not doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're thinking about these new
states as they're coming up, California,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, nearly 70% of all
municipalities have no cannabis laws yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some allow medical production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some allow maybe just medical sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing is going to happen here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to target the municipalities,
get those licenses, and be compliant with
[SPEAKER_00]: the municipalities, being compliant with
health Canada laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the United States is not over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just begun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just these few big MSO
multistate operators that are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take the whole pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting into a new state is vital in
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much, think Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to buy part of a license for 86
million dollars today?
[SPEAKER_00]: That license we helped to get like four
years ago, they spent less than a million
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just these pieces of paper have major,
major value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the United States, you'll notice a lot
of Canadian focus coming down,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get it in capitalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's one problem here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investing into something that's federally
illegal as a foreign national,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the best idea, especially when you
have boards of directors and optics and
[SPEAKER_00]: image.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no problem breaking federal law in
the United States as long as I'm following
[SPEAKER_00]: state or territory law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, by legalizing recreational
cannabis, violated international law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with Uruguay, and this could cause
some major challenges, which we'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into Canada here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of been a fun market to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciated your medical market
initially and what that did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then with the public infusion of
capital, 2014, 2015, it caused,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just call it chaos in Canada and the
rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I remember speaking in San Francisco
for ICBC about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put a million dollars into the top
Canadian public LPs, you'd have $4.1
[SPEAKER_00]: million today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Aurora's stock down 4 or 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the news coming out today,
it'll probably be 7, 8% by the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all got huge, but none of them
remembered that you have to make revenue
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually, and you have to meet these
projections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, taking over the world as a giant
public company sounds great, but everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: wants you every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you're trying to do this,
how you're redeploying capital and buying
[SPEAKER_00]: other companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a Canadian public company and in
the United States, I mean, Laurie Ajax was
[SPEAKER_00]: here earlier today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some major potential
implications of being a foreign national
[SPEAKER_00]: company and investing into something
federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States, we love to protect our
businesses and our IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would happen then as we get closer to
federal legalization, we want to kick out
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have some divesting strategies
as well if you're going to get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States and how you're going to
structure those companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some major things with the cultivation
area, which has expanded.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an actual photo on the left there
of cannabis that was purchased recently
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality is something that people don't
understand once you're an LP.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've bought rec cannabis here,
it's pretty pathetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Colorado in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some good companies that are
doing this, but the packaging and the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, and everyone keeps talking about
all these shortages which we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into, but they don't realize that
quality is something that's paramount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think internationally,
quality is a different term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like this is dank bud bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's consumer quality, but the GMP,
the quality standards by Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to hit that, but you have to also
remember consumer quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same problem that better can has
like world leader in cannabis exports,
[SPEAKER_00]: 19 countries, six varieties that are
shipped into Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the price and the quality,
most people don't like it, but it's some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most standard deviation,
like the lowest in the world, like for
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent supply, but it's garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one likes to smoke it or the dry
kind of horrible cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to start going towards quality
and not selling popcorn nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's not how you launch a
quality brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we think about brands,
it's very, very hard to brand like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're an applesauce company or
Heinz ketchup, that's different than
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the dankest heirloom tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a farmer, I love the quality side,
but the consumer packaged goods and
[SPEAKER_00]: brands, five, six years ago, we just made
fun of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because nothing was quality and they kept
growing more and more, but quality is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the key differentiator in
these markets as they expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is pretty hilarious here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada, there's almost 700 pending LPs
right now because your licensing process
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got your first license, had to build
out your whole expensive facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: have your inspections, and then have a
license with almost 700 in the queue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this much supply that's just sitting
around, it's not that there's a shortage
[SPEAKER_00]: of supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying this so that investment
dollars continue to flow into these LPs to
[SPEAKER_00]: build out cultivation centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm from Northern Wisconsin as a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this thing called winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada is not the best place to grow
cannabis, even with greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in an old Hershey's chocolate
factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your cost of production are high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your taxes are horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very, very hard to structure
correctly in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're thinking about the average
cost of production and what the prices are
[SPEAKER_00]: happening at, building more and more
cultivation centers in Canada is not the
[SPEAKER_00]: option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a craft grower, which God
bless you and I love that side,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't have distribution to get into
the sales channels, you don't have a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen the same thing in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Colorado, we started to put indoor
out of business with big greenhouses back
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009, 10 and 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse is a very good thing,
but then Aurora with their massive
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, it's 110 million Canadian to
build that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have built that with like Turkish
companies, some Dutch companies for about
[SPEAKER_00]: 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not the place where
international exports are gonna happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though you were the first to be able
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is plenty of cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then allowing outdoor production for
oils as you're getting into your extracted
[SPEAKER_00]: products in the future, that's gonna be a
key, key part that's gonna put a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these indoor facilities out of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're thinking about wholesale
price, like benchmarks does a great job in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the average then for all tracked
sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada at this point, when you're
thinking about Bedrock and like I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, they can only sell for 2.5
euros a gram to the office of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis like in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They then sell that to the bee farm,
bee farm to an importer, importer to a
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor, distributor to a pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why in Germany, you'll see cannabis
from 18 to 25 euros a gram that the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: only got 2.5 a gram for that they're
growing it for maybe at 125 to 140 a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your margin is that, you're nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That big sale that they did to London,
the first one of like 400 grams,
[SPEAKER_00]: they made less than a thousand euros from
doing that sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing is gonna happen to
Canadian companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the people building these
facilities out thinking just because you
[SPEAKER_00]: got first mover advantage to ship to the
world, it's all about price.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you meet the quality standard and
you're the lowest price, you get the
[SPEAKER_00]: generic contract for the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not gonna be the Canadians for
much, much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: For what's gonna happen to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flour and a few types of topicals and
basic oils was not the way to launch
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 2007 in December was the first time
for all track sales in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that it wasn't flour anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love a good joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you can just hit a vape pen or
like eat an edible, it's very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very different and gets a lot more
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is gonna explode in Canada with
all the vaping issues that have happened
[SPEAKER_00]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the cannabis that's dangerous
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no regulations for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're seeing the same thing with
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the companies that launched that aren't
using vitamin E or polypropyl glycol as
[SPEAKER_00]: their solvents or their viscous agents,
not reintroducing terpenes or fake
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors, those companies are gonna scale
and do phenomenal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gonna change the face of the
Canadian cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in October when those start to come
out in sales like December through
[SPEAKER_00]: February, when these brands launch,
it's gonna change because your flour
[SPEAKER_00]: quality has been crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your packaging has been pretty crappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not been many stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think in Montreal for a while,
like one store for that whole place or
[SPEAKER_00]: here in BC, like there's so few,
same thing in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: As new products come out and consumer
packaged goods, brands with distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: will change this landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I easily foresee that probably 60,
70% of your market within a year and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half to two years will be infused
extracted products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your packaging has a couple issues to
be seen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some major opportunities for Canada,
even though I'm saying some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges for it, there's gonna be more
and more consolidations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see major ancillary plays for
like ancillary products and ancillary
[SPEAKER_00]: services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this is the first legalized real
country, no offense, Uruguay, you have
[SPEAKER_00]: this opportunity that what works here for
a country will then scale to the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like our point of sale systems,
our packaging companies, our distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: companies are gonna mirror and a lot of
Canadian companies will come down and take
[SPEAKER_00]: that market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in the ancillary side for
cannabis, you're in a good place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also way less risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that for the US has
major, major value.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not your quality of how good you grow
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not saying they don't do that well in
Canada, you of course do, but not making
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got here British Columbia,
the California of Canada grows copious
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of cannabis that's not taxed and
regulated so highly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as this starts to change and more and
more testing is coming out and these big
[SPEAKER_00]: producers start making quality,
that's where I see some key pivotal plays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also your distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have distribution,
which a lot of the big LPs and pubcos have
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to tie up, your products don't make
it to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, if you're not paying for
shelf space as a brand, or have a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good distribution company, your craft
cannabis or your products don't make the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll see companies like
Candescent, not giving a plug out here,
[SPEAKER_00]: four colors and a pretty logo,
small cultivation center, but with a
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution license that buys wholesale,
repackages under their brands,
[SPEAKER_00]: pay for shelf space and flood that product
around the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing is gonna happen here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like many of the big LPs,
they buy from other small producers,
[SPEAKER_00]: repackage it and then get that to the
stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as your brands start to establish,
that's something most people haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Edison and Cova and a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as it gets larger, brands will dictate
the future and a lot of them will be
[SPEAKER_00]: regional and territorial based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exports were huge for Canada because you
used to just have Bedrikan in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five or six of those bigger producers
starting to do their press releases about
[SPEAKER_00]: exports, but it's still not been that high
because internationally without doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: education, there are no patients and
without patients, there's no clients and
[SPEAKER_00]: then no clients, there's no revenue and
then there's no business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been the problem with Aurora and
Canopy and like Tilray getting all these
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses all over the world, which we've
got licenses in 13 countries right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of them you have to hold it and
it's a longer term international play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're producing that for like medical
pharmaceutical cannabis versus we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have wrecked cannabis in Germany anytime
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the export side is what caused a lot
of their value to go huge through the
[SPEAKER_00]: roof, but they were thinking the rest of
the world was gonna be like the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States and Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: International, we export flour and oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compounding happens in pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not vape pens, it's not
suppositories.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get into that side, you're talking
seven to 11 years of pre-clinical clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: three phases of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's like the international play
that's really, really valuable that most
[SPEAKER_00]: people aren't seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about shipping dry flour
around the world, but like our license in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal, we could produce for about 13
euro cents a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tenth of what it costs in the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compared to Canada, I mean maybe an
eighth or I'm sorry, like a 12th as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're already in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why when we talk about Colombia and
some of these other countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's major opportunities, but you have
to use what you did in Canada to scale to
[SPEAKER_00]: the world and not just entrench yourself
thinking this is where you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: produce for the rest of the all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your medical market cannot be forgotten
about patients or how this market
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to always remember that from
different taxes and the same quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: testing standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being able to ship cannabis in the
mail, awesome what you first started here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's being completely forgotten and I
see a major opportunity there long term
[SPEAKER_00]: for a few of the companies that get into
it and are patient focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something that every single
market, remember for the US, getting in
[SPEAKER_00]: from a medical standpoint first is how you
get into the adult use market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get into medical and just
completely forget those roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is a total addressable market that
you're just forgetting about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the brand licensing, the
loyalties, it just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything we know about medical
cannabis and recreational cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: US and Canada is the same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not true medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: This other thing is gonna happen called
pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very interested in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just way too risky for them right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we already passed this threshold
called the safety profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the major value when you develop
a new drug, getting past that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you're getting international and
you think about pharmaceutical,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're doing clinical trials,
if you're getting drug registrations just
[SPEAKER_00]: like all the value of Israel, it's not
about their production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about their old medical research
that's gonna be applicable to the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're starting to do that in
Canada, it's a major foot in the door for
[SPEAKER_00]: this international expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: On your rec side, it's gonna be big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna be as big as most people
think because your taxes are too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your climate cost of production are too
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your illicit market is gonna be harder to
fight in Canada than in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's been a very robust program
and originally medical producers could
[SPEAKER_00]: produce it all over the place,
have their own plants, then they kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once those plants are out there,
this is a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow and people continue to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a supplemental income source,
it's not as lucrative on a long term
[SPEAKER_00]: basis, but it's gonna be very challenging
to fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if anyone's bought a pre-roll joint in
Canada like these packages, like take it
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the big box and it's like this big
plastic thing, a lot of lessons could be
[SPEAKER_00]: learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the United States cannabis companies
and what we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just think what's working in the United
States when it comes to packaging and
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing and how to actually market on a
national basis, which you can do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still a lot of regulations around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't do that in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's been so, so slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But adult use in Canada is gonna go fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had a really shitty first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, pretty pathetic for what it should
have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly based on the municipality and
territorial laws ramping up like the
[SPEAKER_00]: retail store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more illegal stores in BC than
legal stores and they're way cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just walk in like you don't even
have to show an ID, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not advocating illicit sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about where production's
happening and what the tax rates are there
[SPEAKER_00]: and how they give permits, this is very
important for when it comes to cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to do this in Manitoba or
certain places, there's a reason their
[SPEAKER_00]: prices are higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a client of ours years ago like Prince
Edward Island, like their cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: production was ridiculous, but they were
one of the only ones there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that this is getting nationalized on a
larger basis, it's gonna get huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something you have to remember,
governments are more addicted to tax
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue than heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they get a taste of it,
they will fight for it more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we were very scared about the
LCBO originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in Ontario, like cannabis stores just
going to be done in like liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were very scared about it in long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do see the potentiality for this to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting retail licenses, no there could
be a shift, but getting them early is
[SPEAKER_00]: critical to get to revenue side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hemp side has also been good,
but you had Manitoba Harvest, like Tilray
[SPEAKER_00]: bought yours last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your hemp industry is getting less and
less important because there's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: competition internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just about growing hemp here
and doing extraction for terpenes or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and shipping around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some major opportunities to
do hemp in Canada still.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I do see is just like the LPs,
they fought against outdoor production
[SPEAKER_00]: really heavily in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you have a Hershey's
warehouse that you put tens of millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars into to grow weed inside,
and then you can just do a big outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, harvest it with combines and have
oils, and then do extracted products,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna disrupt and interrupt your
entire production market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gonna start happening soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next year, the amount of outdoor
production that you see, it's gonna start
[SPEAKER_00]: to cause your price to come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of your raw plant materials
or your trim from your indoor facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's very, very expensive compared to
outdoor, it's gonna change the game,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like we did in Colorado and
California and other states that allow
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about what the biggest
issues are, your territories and your
[SPEAKER_00]: municipalities for their licensing,
these horrible corrupt lottery systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 3C, we do license applications
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we see lotteries, we're almost not
interested because you can have the best
[SPEAKER_00]: team ever and then just pull them out of a
hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you see the judge that stalled
all of the license issuance in Ontario for
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened in Toronto recently,
one person randomly gets three randomly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I have a group that puts in 10
and gets none.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's issues with that and it's gonna
continue to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, you see the FBI
getting into that mayor in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, yeah, you want a license here,
600,000 bucks, did it for four people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been happening for over a decade,
it's nothing new, and they're gonna start
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into this more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Health Canada really tries to
maintain their image, they're gonna start
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at these things deeper and deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just know, do things legal,
do things compliant, do not cut corners
[SPEAKER_00]: and do not get into the shady side because
if you do long term, it will come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit here on investing,
we manage venture funds, private equity,
[SPEAKER_00]: I see major value in the private side
still for Canada and for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's such a new industry from this
side, most institutional capital won't
[SPEAKER_00]: touch it and banks aren't giving loans,
but how you raise capital and how you look
[SPEAKER_00]: at what investments are real, this is a
major opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could still get 18% interest on real
estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that to a normal real estate
investor and they're like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, you're owning a building
and triple net leasing it to the operator,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not even profiting from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real estate is what everything is
built off of from hands on companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at the real estate
here in Canada for more and more of these
[SPEAKER_00]: places, I'm not even interested in
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little interested in the processing,
extremely interested in the retail real
[SPEAKER_00]: estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's gonna continue to change and
those spaces just like we see in the US
[SPEAKER_00]: will be the major revenue drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're raising capital, you have to
be transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not say that you're gonna continue to
sell pounds for $4,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in Colorado five years ago,
it was 4,400.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, wholesale is less than 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think that you're gonna be
selling this, like your investors are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get more and more seasons,
so be honest, be transparent, show how
[SPEAKER_00]: markets are going to change and how you're
gonna continue to lower your costs and run
[SPEAKER_00]: this like a normal business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key thing for cannabis, when I look at
an investment, which you probably see 100
[SPEAKER_00]: decks a week, I take the word cannabis
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a company, would you still be
interesting if it wasn't just cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: hype?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's CBD dryer sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's CBD pet food.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the other market applicable to
this and how would you be an attractive,
[SPEAKER_00]: like acquisition target?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about these few big brands
in the middle and then all of the brands
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know and are familiar with around
this, this is going to be cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's only a matter of time and it's not
gonna be Constellation and Tilray and
[SPEAKER_00]: Aurora in the middle there, even though
they've been trying that, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get so crushed on stock prices in
this next year as they're not hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: their projections that that side's really
hurting the investor confidence in the
[SPEAKER_00]: space because it sounded so important that
it was so hard to raise capital,
[SPEAKER_00]: so what's everyone do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Run to Canada, list on the CSE.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are good public companies up
here, but 80% are pretty much fraudulent
[SPEAKER_00]: and lie on a daily basis to investors and
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Press releases about growing in Malta and
what they're gonna be doing here or their
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trials or their shipping to San
Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be real, be transparent, but it's only a
matter of time until this happens and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to know your exit as a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna cash flow or are you gonna
have dividends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to sell the company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna join other companies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna go public?
[SPEAKER_00]: But how is the investor going to get their
money back?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you gonna use their capital and
deploy their capital and what sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: returns could they potentially get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Never guarantee anything here,
but you're trying to always think who's
[SPEAKER_00]: the bigger fish that you're gonna buy or
get bought by or try to become,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's no longer trying to be Philip
Morris.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about trying to get bought by Philip
Morris because this industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: normalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting more and more normalized and
it's only a matter of time until the big
[SPEAKER_00]: institutional capital comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to go around the world here kind of
quickly, we work all over the world just
[SPEAKER_00]: to know the opportunities for Canadian
companies there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna legalize rec anytime
soon here, so don't think that's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: the way or you're gonna sell vape
cartridges in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Germany's got less than 30 doctors
making prescriptions, less than a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: million total prescriptions, and the price
is so high and insurance still has
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're thinking about where to
produce in Europe, for Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the license we have in Portugal and
a few of those countries very much matter
[SPEAKER_00]: because if we can produce cheaper and
you're in Europe, they're gonna give
[SPEAKER_00]: preference over buying your products,
but it's not just about growing in Germany
[SPEAKER_00]: or growing, like we got two of the 11
licenses in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't build a building there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sold the license for five and a half
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one I'm keeping for importing to
Denmark, but you have to think what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of reduction in each market?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it applicable to the rest of a
union or a pharmaceutical act and how
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna be a bigger play and not just
that you have a license in Zimbabwe and
[SPEAKER_00]: now you're like doubled your value.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been the major problem here,
but Europe will be a huge market with more
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a pub co or a private co,
no matter where you are internationally,
[SPEAKER_00]: you must focus on doctor and patient
education because without it, there are no
[SPEAKER_00]: prescriptions and not like recommendations
in the US or prescriptions here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you have to have those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, there's no business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're thinking about Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of these colors aren't coming
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only major countries that matter are
South Africa and Lesotho right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course, there's Canadian public
companies in each of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the other countries that have
really come forward with programs are not
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant with international law,
but the reason I love South Africa is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're a PICS country, which means what
they do there matters the same as the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're thinking about
international cannabis, how is it
[SPEAKER_00]: applicable with the rest of the world and
if you're developing products there or
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual property, how that's gonna
scale or be applicable to other markets?
[SPEAKER_00]: But Africa, for any more, I always think,
where can I produce in a country or
[SPEAKER_00]: continent for that country or continent
under their laws other than just thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do European GMP?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone thought that at first,
it's way more expensive and challenging to
[SPEAKER_00]: get than you think, and if you mess up
your first inspection, they're maybe not
[SPEAKER_00]: coming back ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like when those Germans come to your
place in Macedonia or to Georgia or
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever you're gonna be producing,
if it's not ready and right, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't come back or if they
don't come back for two or three years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have no market to sell to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time you get into these
international standards, hire good
[SPEAKER_00]: consultants for it, hire good experts that
know it, hire good legal that know it to
[SPEAKER_00]: show how it's gonna be applicable other
than just trying to have a press release
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to get investors interested in
your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a slow one for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the imports for South Korea,
everyone was talking about Thailand for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone realize Thailand is just for
domestic purposes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And research right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about producing in Thailand all
cheap and selling to the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a law that allows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, you can educate the government
and help with that, but if it's for
[SPEAKER_00]: domestic production, how does that help
your Canadian public value?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially for a total addressable market
that doesn't have qualifying conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: that are like pain, PTSD, glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Internationally, if there's not qualifying
conditions of pain or PTSD, in the US,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's 96% of all medical cards.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you're gonna have no one
like Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Childhood epilepsy, it means you have
1,300 kids you could potentially sell
[SPEAKER_00]: products to with those three licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, Texas is the third highest
population in the country, but there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: total addressable market based on
qualifying conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that part is key for international.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those colors came through,
but Australia's been really slow and
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few big changes are coming there,
more licenses, and they are a PICS
[SPEAKER_00]: country, which means their standards are
gonna be good for international.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the few good Australian companies
that can take and focus on this region are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna do incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: With New Zealand's REC, kind of medical
program is challenging, getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's REC kind of coming soonish,
gonna be good, but don't talk about your
[SPEAKER_00]: Vanuatu REC company gonna like change the
world and like ship REC cannabis to Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: and undercut them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Health Canada is really,
really protective of your market right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't even allow exports of genetics
anymore for most of our companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing from like an import
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really trying to protect their
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to protect this market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to import to Canada is not the
best acquisition strategy to like be
[SPEAKER_00]: buying or trying to develop towards this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the colors here again,
unfortunately, but you've got four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: medical countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia has really taken all the news and
Colombia, of course, near the equator,
[SPEAKER_00]: low cost of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only allowed 40,000 tons of annual
production as a country.
[SPEAKER_00]: My license in Portugal is 438,000 tons a
year by the UN.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one license of mine is like 11
times the entire country of Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Colombia kind of has a season passed
and I love Colombia very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the genetics that the Canadian LPs
ship down there were their dankest,
[SPEAKER_00]: coolest buds from indoor warehouses up
here that don't grow very well in
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence all the mold issues and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be five or six amazing
companies that come out of Colombia,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's the non-psychoactive licenses to
focus on for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, wearing in South America or
Central America can you produce for the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of that area under their standards
compared to trying to do EUGMP in Colombia
[SPEAKER_00]: to ship to the rest of the world or
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna take more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna take a long time to get to that
revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get total revenue first if you
focus on that region first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I always use and kind of close
with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember like being in Boy Scouts
and playing risk like late at night and
[SPEAKER_00]: like wanting to stab people and like 12
hour games and like, I hate this person
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar right now and all the
LPs are like little childish boys playing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at a fire station, you know,
during Boy Scouts when they're kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, I'm gonna take over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got Australia, that's two troops and
South America, that's three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where you put your pieces matter and
you got one shot for where you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: put your pieces on the board today and
where you're gonna establish partnerships
[SPEAKER_00]: and relationships and raise capital or
like Amazon on billions and billions not
[SPEAKER_00]: paying certain taxes where you're
domiciling where you have capital coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in and going out of and how you're gonna
trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think about where all the Canadian
public companies that launched up here,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the easy place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why everyone did it and it was so
unregulated like practical pink slip type
[SPEAKER_00]: listings that should have never been
listed as public companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same shit is about to happen in
London, in Frankfurt, in Israel and Tel
[SPEAKER_00]: Aviv exchange and the Australian exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see probably a thousand
public companies launch in this next year
[SPEAKER_00]: that are cannabis companies that have
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on but there will be some good ones
in there with the CSE and others not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing blind shorting anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know there's a problem in this market
and they know that it's gonna continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: go down and some of them will scale and be
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got one shot now to put this on and
partnerships, you know in human evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got competition and you've got
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collaboration always wins like fighting
people, you know doesn't wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what can you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who can you partner with?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you get bigger because your
company no matter how good it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's others doing the same thing and
you're not that special.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not that unique even though you
might grow the dankest flower or have the
[SPEAKER_00]: coolest water soluble concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you're gonna partner with people,
how you're gonna get distribution,
[SPEAKER_00]: how you're gonna raise additional capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's capital raise, capital raise,
capital raise in more markets but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: about vape pens from Canada being shipped
to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know the rules of each of these
jurisdictions, find local partnerships
[SPEAKER_00]: there that know that market and can scale
that market with you other than trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: go over like an Aurora or a canopy and
trying to take over the world by yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't work for Alexander the Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get too far away from your home base
and then everything crumbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't work for Rome either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can only grow so fast so far but
cannabis is here to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's gonna disrupt almost all
industries that we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone talks about hemp CBD right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about paper and cotton and timbers
and plastics?
[SPEAKER_00]: The long-term play for this industry is
phenomenal and getting an early stage into
[SPEAKER_00]: the private companies doing it is where
I've seen the biggest returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we focus on that and know that
once this board's established just like
[SPEAKER_00]: Monopoly you can only buy a hotel or get
boardwalk or Broadway like one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it, solidify it, raise it and
protect the hell out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see more value for intellectual property
right now than even cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why Constellation and a lot of
these other companies in canopy they're
[SPEAKER_00]: buying shit companies that just did some
really nice IP for protections for things
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna need in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever you're doing, protect it,
get legal, get compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only way to transition and get
your pieces on the board early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how I am on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four minutes, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well thanks for letting me share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any quick questions from anybody here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more time for Nick Easley.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember questions go up at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a question about strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing a lot of companies going into
Canada taking advantage of the publicly
[SPEAKER_01]: traded markets and bringing that capital
back into the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are buying hemp in order to
get across the 280e provisions probably
[SPEAKER_01]: with the strategy of utilizing THC down
the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what about Puerto Rico right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: For a lot of companies going into the US,
Puerto Rico is the only place in the world
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go and not be forced to pay a US
income tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for CBD companies, a lot of them won't
survive without that kind of benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you see Puerto Rico being in the
mix with international cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got that 183 day clause for residency
which kind of makes it challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the US that IRC 280e, it's a tax law
from 1982 to keep cocaine smugglers from
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to have like laundry mats and
like launder their money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't deduct our cost to goods sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean minus hurricanes in a few things
Puerto Rico could be good from a tourist
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't focus on that territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focused on Guam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I've got 1.6 billion people that
live within a four hour flight of Guam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical is legal, rec's legal and coming
and it's very very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD side is going to be a lot less
regulated soon because we had our first
[SPEAKER_00]: farm bill 2014, the 18 farm bill and now
it's starting to change with a few of the
[SPEAKER_00]: banking laws that are in the Senate right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD side and the hemp side should have
banking by 2020 and also not have IRC 280e
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the foot in the door which then
means cannabis companies soon won't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to deal with that once medical
legalization happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be some interesting domicile plays
there for like that being domiciled ship
[SPEAKER_00]: there and then shipped to the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen anyone take advantage of it
yet but it's definitely for the CBD side
[SPEAKER_00]: of potentiality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right well let's go Ethan.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more time Nick Easley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all very much.
Thank you.
