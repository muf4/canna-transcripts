[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everybody and welcome to our panel
on operating a Medicaid cannabis company
[SPEAKER_03]: post recreational legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think personally this is actually a
very, very important topic because we have
[SPEAKER_03]: to make sure that patients can keep access
and that the dispensary is not the
[SPEAKER_03]: alternative option for patient access.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm very, very happy to have for many
experienced entrepreneurs on my panel
[SPEAKER_03]: today who have a lot of experience with
these topics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Diane Scott from JMCC Group.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's the chair and CEO.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are a company from Canada,
but they are operating in Jamaica and in
[SPEAKER_03]: Jersey.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Dave Grafman who is counseled with
Grafman Mayfield and from California.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Alex Ravitch, equity partner at
Hyburn Farm and Cannabis Education and
[SPEAKER_03]: Medical Partnership at Bush Brands from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have Steven Fabig, president and
CEO at Hello Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello Cannabis has two branches,
the Hello Cannabis Clinics and the Hello
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Retail concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm super excited to have these
experienced panelists here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd say we just jump straight in and
start with you, Diane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diane, I understand most of the JMCC
Group's operations are based in Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you're a Canadian company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how did adult use legalization in
cannabis affect your business?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Lisa, because two things to
start with.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Health Canada has banned imports into
Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: So despite the fact that we have exported
between 2018 and 2020, about 30,000 kilos
[SPEAKER_07]: of drug flower, today you cannot import
into Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing is we, at the time,
started to see the writing on the wall.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an excessive amount of cannabis
available in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it was very clear we were going to
see some double pressure on the pricing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in Canada, what we do is we support
research.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are in a pediatric and adult epilepsy
trial with the University of Saskatchewan.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's all of our activity at this
time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for us, it had very little impact on
our business model.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, what do you think, as Europe looks
ahead to legalize recreational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: what are three or four most important
things that we can learn from you from the
[SPEAKER_03]: US, particularly in California?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to ICBC for inviting us here today
and to all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to my good friend over here,
Matt Cuman, who was my guru and mentor who
[SPEAKER_01]: brought me into this 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in San Diego by way of New York
since 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been watching California,
in particular, transitioning from medical
[SPEAKER_01]: to adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tend to try to refer to recreational as
adult use on purpose because we think
[SPEAKER_01]: that, this is one of the things I think
we've learned, is that calling it
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational plays into the hands of the
haters who think that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: pervert their children.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that we've been
trying very hard to change the messaging
[SPEAKER_01]: on these last few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been quite a transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2018 was the first year that we had adult
use in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things I think I can say,
there's an old saying when I was growing
[SPEAKER_01]: up, those who don't know history are
condemned to repeat it.
So I encourage you all in Europe to watch.
Study what we've done in the United
States, states like California,
Colorado, Washington, Oregon.
More recently, states like New York,
New Jersey, Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost scientifically study what we've
done right and what we've done wrong.
And try to avoid the mistakes that have
been made.
And try to emphasize the things that we've
done right.
So for example, in the United States,
particularly in California, we have not
[SPEAKER_01]: really used technology as much as I think
we could have to streamline the licensing
[SPEAKER_01]: and permitting process to make it more
efficient and economical to get people
into the business and to get them to do
what they want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the licensing and permitting process
has become very cost-permitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I recommend that you try to find ways
to use technology to streamline the
[SPEAKER_01]: process and keep costs down.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't look at excise taxes or VAT as the
way to make money for the government,
[SPEAKER_01]: solve all the problems, pacify the people
who are against this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the more the product ends up
costing the patient or the consumer,
[SPEAKER_01]: the higher the likelihood is that the
illicit market is going to thrive.
And that's going to make it harder for
those of you who want to operate legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I guess the last thing I'd say in
my little three or four points what we can
[SPEAKER_01]: learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Innovate, innovate, innovate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never stop innovating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, super important point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for saying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alex, how did the limitation of cannabis
affect medical patients in Canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what lessons were learned to prevent
or can be learned to prevent the same
[SPEAKER_03]: issues here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I really want to bring this over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, thanks for having me again.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great to be back in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really wanted to express that,
yes, everyone's excited about
[SPEAKER_06]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone's excited about having cannabis
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: We believe that cannabis should not have
been prohibited to begin with.
[SPEAKER_06]: That the illicit market has a lot of the
challenges that we want to do better in
[SPEAKER_06]: the legal market.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we cannot forget about the medical
pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is something that has to be
stressed.
Because what happened in Canada,
and I'm almost still Steve Stugger because
[SPEAKER_06]: this is something that he's lived through,
is once recreational happens, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_06]: companies who were fake medical started to
come out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You start to realize who really cared
about medical and who didn't.
And then you start to realize a lot of
these companies that were talking medical,
the second the wreck happened,
they threw everything on the ground and
ran as fast as they can to go public and
open up retail stores.
Which is not as wonderful as people think
it is, but that's another topic for
[SPEAKER_06]: another day.
The thing is that I think Germany can
really learn from our mistakes is around,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have a maximum on the amount of THC for
edibles as an example.
[SPEAKER_06]: But why not for medical purposes?
[SPEAKER_06]: Why should there be a maximum?
There's no maximum on the amount of other
medications and you have to trust patients
to be able to take that right amount.
So that's one example.
Also, taxes on medicine is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_06]: We in Canada don't tax any medicine except
we have taxes on medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that always made no sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a few things that we did wrong,
but one thing that we're starting to do
[SPEAKER_06]: right, but I think Germany has an
advantage of, is on the pharmacy side.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very proud to see that Germany is going
full speed ahead with going medical
cannabis to pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would have helped Canada a lot
because to have pharmacy-led cannabis is
[SPEAKER_06]: really the way it should have been done.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's going to be a big
advantage for you here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the last point I'll say, and we'll let
Steve kind of talk to this point,
[SPEAKER_06]: is around insurance.
That's another thing that in Germany,
because you have some insurance covered,
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear a lot of people complaining about
it's not covered enough and not enough
[SPEAKER_06]: approvals.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can tell you in Canada, we only have one
group and they're the military veterans
[SPEAKER_06]: who have coverage.
And that's considered a very lucrative
kind of offering for licensed producers.
But here in Germany, you have way more
coverage already.
And this is something very typical in
Canada too.
In Canada, we sometimes complain about our
industry and then we go elsewhere and we
realize how good we have it.
And I would also just last point to
express that to the German people is that
as tough as it is, you're still so much
further ahead than you used to be and
there's a lot to be proud of.
So you should definitely be proud of that
fact that you even have pharmacare and
that you do have coverage for anybody,
even though there's a lot to be desired
and there's more coverage to be had.
There are some things to be proud of.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are just some quick thoughts and
I'm sure I'll share some of my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steven, can you tell us a little bit how
do you differentiate between patient
[SPEAKER_03]: access and the recreational side of your
business?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the main differences between
those, like if you look at it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is one of the largest
challenges that we faced and one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: key things that we wanted to actually be
able to do at Hello!
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada is what we found is this big blend,
blurry area between medical patients that
[SPEAKER_05]: use cannabis and recreational users that
use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the key goals that we started
trying to do when I moved from the legacy
[SPEAKER_05]: market over into the legal medical clinic
market is to be able to try
[SPEAKER_05]: differentiating between medical patients
and recreational users.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is a distinct difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello!
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis started as one of the first
independent legal medical clinics.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're now operating with over 6,000
patients and we've gathered enough data to
[SPEAKER_05]: see distinct differences between medical
patients and recreational users.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of that is derived because of
essentially how access is given.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're seeing some very similar trends
basically with how they have access.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now it's very easy to walk into a
brick and mortar store and typically
[SPEAKER_05]: you're certain you see a different
demographic.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you look at medical patients,
you're seeing a different demographic.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you were trying to differentiate
between medical and recreational,
[SPEAKER_05]: I found that a very, very, very difficult
challenge because I will candidly admit
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a patient first.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always been a patient first.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was blessed to be able to share my
origins toward your son six years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very nice to be back at us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you again NCBC for having us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do use cannabis recreationally as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there's a very distinct
difference between when I'm using it
[SPEAKER_05]: medically and when I'm using it
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we did differently is we opened up
one of the first legal recreational stores
[SPEAKER_05]: in the country and we actually
intentionally put it right beside where
[SPEAKER_05]: our brick and mortar medical clinic was.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're unfortunately hindered to be able to
give any medical advice with respect to
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis in a recreational store.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet one in three people would walk in and
ask a question about the medical
[SPEAKER_05]: properties of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And legally we're not able to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So of course everybody finds a loophole in
how they can talk about a medical aspect
[SPEAKER_05]: of it, but not talking about a medical
aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, wow, if you really want to
feel relaxed, you do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have 25 year old kids that are
coming in asking medical questions or
[SPEAKER_05]: suing those fake medical questions to be
able to find something for their
[SPEAKER_05]: grandmother, who's a 75 year old lady who
probably has a whole host of other medical
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions and medications that would
definitely be interacting with cannabis in
[SPEAKER_05]: a different way.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to speak to a specialist.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to speak to somebody that
understands hydration, that understands
[SPEAKER_05]: their personal needs and how to be able to
use it properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately that's completely
lacking in the recreational world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were the first in the world to do
this and it's a model that actually worked
[SPEAKER_05]: far better than I expected.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really encourage people to look at
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the model for this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It truly is not meant to be a self
promotion here, but it worked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And having a medical clinic beside that
recreational store and being able to track
[SPEAKER_05]: these trends and offer the services for
every single different consumer of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis was an absolute game changer for
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think an absolute game changer for
the area in Southern Ontario.
[SPEAKER_05]: For us to be able to have a 25 year old
kid come in and ask questions for his
[SPEAKER_05]: grandmother, but then be able to
immediately give them access and most
[SPEAKER_05]: importantly his grandmother's access to a
doctor to be able to speak about what
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically they need really changes the
game.
And there is a distinct difference between
cannabis when it's used medically and
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately you do need a doctor to
be able to differentiate that or at least
[SPEAKER_05]: a formal educator.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where the pharmacists I think
come in also because with their formal
[SPEAKER_06]: training.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what Germany is really good at,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you have to understand that in
Germany we are at a very critical point at
[SPEAKER_03]: the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our observational survey that was running
stopped.
[SPEAKER_03]: They published the results.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes a lot against flower and like a
lot of patients are scared that they will
[SPEAKER_03]: lose access now once recreational reform
comes to the literature to say we won't
[SPEAKER_03]: pay for your flower products anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may add just like 10 seconds there.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we noticed as soon as recreational
opened up, not only did the licensing
[SPEAKER_05]: producers that had this fake medical,
we were their only source of revenue.
If you were a medical clinic you were the
only source of revenue for LPs.
And when rep came out they all ran.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately we saw that access to
medicine became extremely limited.
[SPEAKER_05]: The resources we had to be able to help
patients became extremely limited and
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody went straight rep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately a lot of those LPs that
went recreational stopped even paying us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have absurd amounts of accounts
receivables from LPs that just said we're
[SPEAKER_05]: not supporting medical anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are very, very critical elements
that have crushed very good companies with
[SPEAKER_05]: very good people that were driving them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And their elements that will come out of
Germany does not do this right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can actually destroy an industry's
morale.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can actually destroy the real poor
purpose and economics of this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen it destroy a lot of people
in the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Canada we survived this some way
somehow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a full head of hair at one point and
it wasn't that long ago.
Sorry, can I just add to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing that happens when you see
these players go rush into Iraq and pull
[SPEAKER_07]: out of medical is your research funding
dries up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can't tell you how many requests we
get for supporting research.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Canada right now because our friendly
competitors have all pulled out because
[SPEAKER_07]: there is so much focused on the
recreational market.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got patients who have challenges
with access.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have patients who can't afford their
medicine because we have excise tests and
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have research that is not getting the
kind of funding that we should have and we
[SPEAKER_07]: had at the beginning of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's not just yes we need to
make sure patients have what they need.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we talk about this industry around
the world the regulators are asking for
[SPEAKER_07]: real world data.
[SPEAKER_07]: You cannot get real world data if people
are not investing in the science.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so again that's hard for protecting
your medical cannabis industry while you
[SPEAKER_07]: bring up the rec industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again I'm biased.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't do rec.
[SPEAKER_07]: Power to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a place.
[SPEAKER_03]: But shouldn't that be true also for
example for if you say cannabis has
[SPEAKER_03]: certain effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shouldn't you also be able to provide some
data that really.
Absolutely and that can happen if you
don't do the research.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right Dave I wanted to ask you a
question about compassionate use and
[SPEAKER_03]: patient collaborators and those kind of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have those kind of things in
California?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well California has for the most part
since 2018 really the adult use market aka
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational has really taken off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the eyes of most of the public has
more or less replaced medical.
We don't have separate medical
dispensaries or separate medical
pharmacies.
A medical patient with a medical
recommendation because in California a
doctor can give a recommendation.
It's not a formal prescription fulfilled
at a pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a recommendation that long
enforcement recognizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a recommendation you can go
into a adult use recreational store.
[SPEAKER_01]: A wide variety of products are deliverable
in many different formats from flower
[SPEAKER_01]: approvals to gummies beverages to
chocolate and many other things in
[SPEAKER_01]: between.
And the main difference for the medical
patient with the recommendation is while
they're going to pay they will pay the
same state sales tax that any California
for example will pay on any product food
electronics.
They're going to pay the same state sales
tax.
They won't pay the excise tax the extra
special excise tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the medical patient gets that break if
you want to call it that.
And then the medical patient can also grow
at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow six eight ten plants and even
get together with a few friends who are
also medical patients.
There is an opportunity there that has not
been I don't think it's been mentioned or
utilized as much as it will be in the
years to come as the adult use market
[SPEAKER_01]: continues to struggle with the illicit
market over taxation and regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well this part is particularly interesting
because we have of course patients who do
[SPEAKER_03]: not have access yet who are still
illegally growing and who get raided by
[SPEAKER_03]: the police and these things are happening
in reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting raided.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still getting raided.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still getting raided.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have like it's crazy but in the end
it's also about excess.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's this discussion going on that
patients are not able to cultivate the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis so it can be a medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your stance on that?
That's going to change.
I mean that's plain and simple.
That's going to change.
And you know on that note it's funny I got
to say there's just it's so repetitive and
deja vu like it feels like such a
flashback of 2013 in Canada.
All the same things that I hear complain
about here is the same thing we complain
about.
Oh we can't let people grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: We let them grow.
We're not going to have an industry.
It's like what the hell are you talking
about?
We've had people growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look I grow in my house.
[SPEAKER_06]: I still buy plenty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your industry is safe from people growing
their own.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not worry about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's laughable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect example is how many people have a
vegetable garden in their backyard and
still buy fresh fruit and vegetables.
That's a great point.
I've been MMAR since 2010.
[SPEAKER_05]: I first got it with a 50 client limit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's even far more than enough medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just for planning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you still purchasing from stores?
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many exact carbon copies that
are happening right here and we're hearing
[SPEAKER_05]: the same fear stories that led Canada down
a very very odd path.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're seeing it all being planted here
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a brilliant point that Alex
said.
[SPEAKER_05]: People think if you're going to grow your
own cannabis it's like well if they can
[SPEAKER_05]: grow tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shit like all these greenhouses are going
to be toast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's going to buy any tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tomato industry is going to be dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I grow tomatoes in my backyard every
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I buy shitload of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just quickly before we go on.
The key thing also I want to express is
around processing.
It's about finished goods.
The actual growing, the actual buy is not
where it's at.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know everyone's setting up and
raising millions and we did that in Canada
[SPEAKER_06]: too.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had words like funded capacity and cut
canopy size and just silly stuff like
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get fooled by that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter how much cannabis you
can grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what you can do with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can grow my own cannabis but can I
extract my own oil?
[SPEAKER_06]: No I don't think I have a million dollar
extractor that can do the oil extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or can I make my own edibles?
Oh yeah sure I can make a chocolate but
can I make 10,000 and a million
chocolates?
Like this is where the money is in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not in the growing.
So anyways just a quick little rant on
that.
Apologies.
No it's good.
I hope you all carefully listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you mentioned before that patients act
on negatively impacted by the introduction
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis recreational market.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened there and how long did it
take to work itself back out?
[SPEAKER_05]: It hasn't worked out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say I think it's still
working out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's worse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Work in progress.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're hearing it here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've all said we're hearing the same
thing in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be a real shame if Germany
doesn't look real hard at what happened in
[SPEAKER_07]: Canada and California.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know I think at the end of the
day, this is something I said last month,
[SPEAKER_07]: sorry boys you're hearing me again,
but I said last month in Canada is that we
[SPEAKER_07]: need to ensure we have almost two
divergent industries here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying there is some degree of
similarity, particularly when you're
[SPEAKER_07]: looking at quality and care of your
consumer ingestiveness or you're a
[SPEAKER_07]: patient.
[SPEAKER_07]: You still have to have a significantly
high bar when it comes to quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know again I have an extreme medical
bias so we don't believe that smoking is
[SPEAKER_07]: the best way to take one's medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you know we look at best of class
technology like nanomulsification and I
[SPEAKER_07]: think when you're truly putting your
patient first, that is a different
[SPEAKER_07]: discussion than when you're creating a
consumer product for consumer enjoyment.
When you have people like we do who are
compromised and compromised immune
systems, they could be out there living
life.
That's what's at the heart of our product.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the things that the panel before were
talking about, eGMP, quality standards,
[SPEAKER_07]: GACP, these are all extremely expensive
endeavors to get to and one of the things
[SPEAKER_07]: to get back to Canada that we also saw,
I think that guys would agree with me,
[SPEAKER_07]: is when we had the rush for rec,
we also had significant downward pressure
[SPEAKER_07]: on the economy.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had so much product in the industry
that was shifting into the rec industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you have patients who can't access
medicine but we have a massive black
[SPEAKER_07]: product which is pushing pressure on the
economics and what suffered was quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now you've got consumers and
patients who are suffering from quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so again it's just another flag that
we would send to Germany and for me
[SPEAKER_07]: personally why I say you need to look at
these industries in relation to who the
end user is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a patient is a different end user to
Steve's point than somebody who wants to
[SPEAKER_07]: have a joint on their deck on a Saturday
night with a glass of wine.
It's a completely different situation.
Just one thing to add to that,
why did the quality suffer?
It's around the economics.
This is another lesson to be learned.
Once you let, and no offense to any
business people, I mean we're at a
business conference so can't be saying
anything negative about business people of
course, but when it becomes about the
dollars and cents, much more than the
patients, and money is raised,
you start to figure out, wait a minute,
how do we save money?
How do we cut corners?
And that's when quality really starts to
suffer.
There's very few high quality growers.
It's very expensive to grow.
But there's sure a lot of low and medium
quality growers trying to bring their
costs down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's a lesson to be learned
also is cannabis is not very expensive to
[SPEAKER_06]: grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: We talk about it being very expensive,
but the actual cost of growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: it can even be done really high quality
for not that expensive.
When you talk about taxes, it was funny
earlier this talk here with all the
government officials, they're all taxes,
they're all just waiting, like salivating,
waiting on the tax dollars.
Same thing happening in Canada,
right now, every dollar that's sold,
50 cents of it is going into taxes in
Canada.
Like that's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can add that, 71 cents, and this is
an actual real data, 71 cents out of every
[SPEAKER_05]: single dollar for the retail brick and
mortar is to the government.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're scrambling over 29 cents.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so that's the problem when you talk
about low quality, so economics,
[SPEAKER_06]: it could be really well, but once too many
people get their hands in and greedy
[SPEAKER_06]: people, they want to make a lot of money
on it with low expenses, and then the
[SPEAKER_06]: government sees how much money is being
made, and before you know it, that's what
we get into this problem.
You want to add something?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I could just say the other thing,
again, bringing my focus is when we're
[SPEAKER_07]: looking at what's coming in addition to
the growth standards, the other thing to
[SPEAKER_07]: look at is what is going on your plants,
and what if you're growing in ground,
[SPEAKER_07]: what can leach into your plants?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that that is an important consumer,
it is, but as a medical patient,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you're going through chemotherapy,
and you're taking something that holds
[SPEAKER_07]: some of those heavy metals in it,
never mind people have blown any
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticides on it, but the heavy metals
from something down the road has leached
[SPEAKER_07]: into you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a very dangerous situation for a
patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been talking a lot about
differences between the industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe we can talk a little bit about what
is similar between the two parts,
[SPEAKER_03]: and what can we learn from the existing
medical part for the recreational market.
Wanna go first, Dave, or Alex?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see, I think one of the things
that we've observed, as I mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, in the California experience,
is that the delivery system, if you will,
pretty much got merged, so that as far as
where to go to buy your medicine,
or buy your adult use product,
there's one place, instead of the pharmacy
[SPEAKER_01]: for your medicine and the cannabis store,
for your adult use product, it's pretty
much one retail store, so you're gonna
wanna decide here in Germany and in
Europe, is that the model you wanna
follow, or where do you wanna try to
divide it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as we talked about, there's really
two different products here, and it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very important decision to be made
sooner rather than later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying that the California or
the US model, for that matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is pretty similar in most states,
is the best model, but it has been working
to the extent that for the consumer
patient, or adult use consumer,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are, if you haven't been to
California, please come to California for
[SPEAKER_01]: many reasons, but if for nothing else,
to tour our, I hate to use the shitty
word, you might wanna come visit one of
our cannabis stores, some of them you feel
like you're walking into an Apple store,
you know, with all the sales people,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bud tenders, they're all wearing the
same colored shirt, and they're all doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: iPad, start asking, introduce themselves
and get your name and what are you there
[SPEAKER_01]: for, and they will show you around a wide
variety of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as we talked about, there's some care
that needs to be taken about where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting your advice if you're there for a
medical product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you wanna have some person maybe who
has been in the business for six months or
[SPEAKER_01]: two years, giving you your advice on what
you should be taking for your neuralgia,
[SPEAKER_01]: your aches, your pains, your stomach
problems, probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's an interesting model,
and as a consumer, it's fascinating.
So I recommend, and for any journalists in
the audience, if you haven't written an
article yet about the 50 things that the
50 states or the 47 states in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States and Canada have done right and done
wrong, I encourage you to write that
article, because there's a lot of data to
learn from.
On that note, one mistake that I hope
Germany does not make, so you go to Vegas,
and you go to this one place, Planet 13,
which is so ridiculous, and maybe that
works in Vegas, but if anyone out there is
looking to buy a retail store,
[SPEAKER_06]: most people wanna buy their cannabis and
get that done.
[SPEAKER_06]: So before you start spending all this
money on all these fancy stores and all
[SPEAKER_06]: this experience inside your store,
most people are not gonna care,
and you're not gonna realize that until
your store is open, and you're just
watching people not even look at your
fancy walls that you spent thousands of
dollars on, and they're just being like,
looking at you and then leaving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to talk about some of the positive
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we've maybe been a little negative
up here.
No, no, but we wanna be positive.
One thing that is very, very important is
around education.
We came here to ICBC six years ago,
talking about the importance of education.
Here we are six years later, still talking
about the importance of education,
so I hope Germany really gets that right,
is around the education side of it,
and something that me and Diane were
talking about backstage is around the
importance of research.
You want medical to really be separated.
You really need to focus on the research.
There's a lot of different modes of use
now.
In Canada's defense, we started this with
only bud.
Everything else was a levo.
You could have gone to jail for making
oil.
That's how we started in 2013.
It's absurd.
Germany has a chance to be so much better
because we know so much better.
There's a bit more research done,
more needs to do.
Invest in the research.
Don't just put those money in the pockets
of your shareholders.
Put it back into the cannabis research.
If I may, I'll keep this short and sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please see the value in people that are
actually operating entities now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have been doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody that I've seen, I was in 16
countries the year before COVID,
[SPEAKER_05]: speaking at many different places,
working with many different governments
[SPEAKER_05]: around the world, and some countries are
actually paying attention to people that
[SPEAKER_05]: are actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Saying you can do it, having a vision,
having a sales head, having the best team
[SPEAKER_05]: in the world, all that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's super great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk to people that are actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot different when you actually do
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The value and the little tips and tricks
that you can get from people that are
[SPEAKER_05]: actually doing it, please do not
underestimate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five minutes with somebody like Alex,
somebody like myself, when you're talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about each different specific thing,
when you're talking about all of these
[SPEAKER_05]: different specialties that we all have,
I'm telling you, five minutes of time with
[SPEAKER_05]: us can literally say be the difference
between a profitable long-term business
[SPEAKER_05]: and completely getting crushed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have watched some of the best teams
that raised the most money get absolutely
[SPEAKER_05]: slaughtered.
[SPEAKER_05]: We bootstrapped this ourselves and started
taking actual seed funding after we were
[SPEAKER_05]: generating revenue.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really eat what we cook, and we learn
the hard way and we learn the right way,
[SPEAKER_05]: in my opinion, and I beg for Germany to do
that too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen the exact same things happening
here and the exact same overconfidence
[SPEAKER_05]: thinking we know exactly what we want.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I walk into a store, I know what I
want.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm going to grow cannabis and own a
production site, I know exactly how to do
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't, and we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: This information is vital.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will save you millions of dollars,
and a lot of us have this experience to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to help.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are people that genuinely get more joy
out of sharing this knowledge to be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to help people knowing that this is a
product that has saved lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this firsthand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have held more hands than people crying
saying that I have saved their lives than
[SPEAKER_05]: in any other industry in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a special industry with special
people, but it is also a very special
[SPEAKER_05]: industry with some very terrible people
that will absolutely crush you if you are
[SPEAKER_05]: not following the rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, I beg, talk to people that know
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk to the people that are actually doing
it, that have real revenue, real
[SPEAKER_05]: experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will help a lot, and most of those
people that are successful doing it want
[SPEAKER_05]: to help, not take advantage, and I hope
you have a strong
[SPEAKER_03]: relationship with the people that are
doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: From a medical standpoint, it is product
innovation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be continued.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to continually be looking at how
do you make sure your product looks like
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine, it looks like something your
child with epilepsy would be comfortable
[SPEAKER_07]: to use, or your grandmother or grandfather
would be comfortable to use, and it just
[SPEAKER_07]: takes constant innovation, constant
investment, and if I could just add one
[SPEAKER_07]: other thing, just something Steve said,
do not rush to the almighty public money.
[SPEAKER_07]: We stay private.
[SPEAKER_07]: For seven years of this, it was supposed
to take four.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, do not rush to the almighty
because it gets much, much harder once you
[SPEAKER_07]: have taken that money.
[SPEAKER_05]: It keeps you prudent.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are private, it really keeps you
prudent with your operations and your
[SPEAKER_05]: spending.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are a profitable private company,
it speaks absolute volumes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at what the public companies have
done in the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninety-four percent dropped in the last
three years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am looking at when we took our final
seed grant, like $3.5 million.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were the number one peer-reviewed store
in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did $14.7 million in sales our first
year, and we stayed private, and I was
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at what happened with UN Public
and what people were doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: These companies have dropped 91 percent in
three years, and then they just use their
[SPEAKER_05]: stock as currency and drag everybody down
with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The amount of deals that have been offered
that I have wanted to take with paper
[SPEAKER_05]: money and a few of them that I did take,
I would have been holding eight cents on
[SPEAKER_05]: the dollar, and I got strung out of
nearly, nearly written into bankruptcy
[SPEAKER_05]: more than once because of chasing a big
exit, and don't make that mistake.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a little bit of greed in my eyes,
and I would never do that again.
I don't want to see anybody else do it.
Well, I'll try to make this quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started out working with cannabis
clients in the cannabis field,
[SPEAKER_01]: as I mentioned earlier, 12 years ago.
I've been a copyright and trademark in the
electrical property and innovation lawyer
[SPEAKER_01]: for 40 years, but I started taking those
skills into the cannabis space about 12
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago because as we were starting to
see California move from medical to adult
[SPEAKER_01]: use, I started seeing that it was
inevitable that the investment investors
[SPEAKER_01]: and the partners and the Wall Street
finance companies were going to start
coming in to try to get into the industry
and innovate, but they were going to want
[SPEAKER_01]: to know how to collateralize their
investments, and so it was only a matter
[SPEAKER_01]: of time before the companies that were
moving from medical to adult use were
going to start asking, where are my
copyrights?
Where are my trademarks?
Where are my patents?
Where are my trade secrets?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage you as you're making this
transition, if this transition is
[SPEAKER_01]: inevitable, which it looks like it may be,
to start thinking now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn everything you can about copyrights,
patents, trademarks, trade secrets,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're going to help your
industry stay ahead of your competitors,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it also encourages you to stay
innovative, and the four basic tools,
[SPEAKER_01]: copyrights, patents, trademarks,
trade secrets, learn, learn, learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out what's going to be most
important to you, and then how to roll
[SPEAKER_01]: them out, how to implement those processes
in your business, in what sequence that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes the most sense for you, for your
budget.
And I'll close it off and we'll open up to
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Further following on what Steve was saying
is that talk to people with experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have that luxury.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were starting something that no one
else has done, so it was very difficult,
[SPEAKER_06]: walked into a lot of brick walls in the
dark, not realizing it, but now you have
people who have done it, and not only who
have done it, make sure when people tell
you about what they've done, make sure
they've actually done it.
Make sure they've actually executed on
what they said, not just in theory.
I'm here with my company Loosh Brands.
We've done things on a large scale,
and don't get fooled by people who say
they can do something that haven't done
it.
When you're getting advice, make sure it's
from people who have done it, and if they
have done it, then they can help you,
and they can save you tons of money and
tons of headache and time.
So that's my last advice, and a lot of
stories, not a lot of action.
All right.
Thank you, everybody, and we'll open the
floor with a round of applause.
Let's hear it for the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Misha, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve, Alex, I know you very well.
Get him the microphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to be on stage right here with
Clint for many years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been on the same stage as this
gentleman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Clint Young.
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve, Alex, I love you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to run the biggest political
cannabis illegal dispensary in Canada
[SPEAKER_04]: before legalization, MMJ Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: These problems that you guys are speaking
about now, even after legalization,
[SPEAKER_04]: are the problems that I was screaming
about at the top of my lungs about
[SPEAKER_04]: research and development, lack of support
from the government.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all going through the same thing now
that we're legalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be opening another multiple
medical cannabis chains in the next few
[SPEAKER_04]: months, licensed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know that the government's corrupt.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to take care of patients
the way they should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that there is no support for the
patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of being upset about it
constantly, what are we going to do as a
[SPEAKER_04]: group, Diane, Steve, Alex, myself,
what are we to do differently to protect
[SPEAKER_04]: the patients?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have to be a lot more creative
than any other person in the industry
[SPEAKER_04]: because of the lack of resources that we
have, even with proven research,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is being denied by the recreational
market for financials because they want to
[SPEAKER_04]: keep the profits going instead of taking
care of the patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my question truly is how do we work
together and how do we fix this moving
forward?
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can answer that very short and sweet
question for the man.
A hat's off to you as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what, I've always kept my hat to
this gentleman.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're from the same area and he was kind
of like the king of the illegal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't even use that word for myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was the guy for the illegal medical side
and people thought it was like we were
[SPEAKER_05]: arch nemesis, but it was very,
very, very different than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what can we do differently?
[SPEAKER_05]: Candidly, I'm not going to publicly
disclose what we're doing to be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: bypass what the government is taking out
of our pockets that literally makes it
[SPEAKER_05]: financially impossible for us to have
longevity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be happy to talk to people
individually about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm dead serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works and it's planned.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clips on the same page as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the second part is helping other
countries to not make the same damn
[SPEAKER_05]: mistakes, man, because we're passing point
of no return in many areas in Canada and
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a charter investment manager.
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked on Bay Street for 14 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I own my own investment firm as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know finance and I know cannabis and I
know business.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know those three things exceptionally
well and I'll stand toe to toe with
[SPEAKER_05]: anybody and help and want to learn more
myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the only way that we're going to be
able to change this is if we're able to
[SPEAKER_05]: help other countries because Canada in
many cases is beyond the point of no
[SPEAKER_05]: return unless you were able to really put
a creative hat on and unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not going to publicly disclose that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I add something for Germany?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the advantage here that we have an
industry association that is representing
[SPEAKER_03]: the entire industry and that we are
working across sections and it's not only
[SPEAKER_03]: affecting something that is for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still, the help is in a horrible situation
and we need to do definitely some changes
[SPEAKER_03]: there and get it out of narcotics laws and
just not only think about the recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: part, but this is the important thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're here in Germany, you want to
make a difference, please come address me
[SPEAKER_03]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And see how we can all collaborate and
create an industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, we can do one short one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a short question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine's short and it's right after that
great point that you just made because
[SPEAKER_02]: actually this morning we heard from three
representatives from a coalition
[SPEAKER_02]: government here who were saying in my mind
all the right things, things that we
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't heard in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have a government saying that
they support access to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to protect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should actually be more insurance
coverage.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the things I was hearing this
morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was interested if there's a
consolidated plan coming from the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: association about how to protect medical
cannabis post legalization and whether in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada, if we had that opportunity from
some of the experts here, if we can crush
[SPEAKER_02]: our cynicism for a minute and think about
what we might have said to Health Canada
[SPEAKER_02]: if we had their ear like you may have
here.
So can I answer that because I had two
very specific points with Health Canada
the last time I met them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to raise my hand and tell you it
was pre-COVID.
[SPEAKER_07]: First and foremost, I don't believe the
economics for long-term health of a
[SPEAKER_07]: medical product north of the equator are
going to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so in a country like Canada where you
are barring imports and so you're denying
[SPEAKER_07]: your patients access to affordable medical
cannabis products that, okay, they weren't
[SPEAKER_07]: from or produced in Canada, but if they
meet the same standards, if they are held
[SPEAKER_07]: to the same obligations as Canadian
licensed producers, then that medicine
[SPEAKER_07]: should be allowed to your patient.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's number one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And number two, I argued with them about
excess tax because we are taxing medical
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis the same way we tax alcohol in
Canada today.
[SPEAKER_07]: At very minimum, I said if you're going to
do that, you should be taking that money
[SPEAKER_07]: and reinvesting it into your research in
this country so that we can again ensure
that our patients are getting the benefit
of the funds that are flowing through this
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm starting to cut everybody off a weird
way over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it again for this audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
