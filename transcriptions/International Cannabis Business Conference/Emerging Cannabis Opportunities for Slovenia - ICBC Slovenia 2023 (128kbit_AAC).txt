[SPEAKER_04]: All right To discuss emerging cannabis
opportunities in Slovenia to lead this
[SPEAKER_04]: panel a Leading journalist commentator and
talk show host.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure I get it right Vita
Petrochich So
[SPEAKER_02]: now now I invite the other guests The
person who had the question I asked you To
[SPEAKER_02]: to prepare the question for this panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so Luca Friar Founder of money to
Petra Marinka Founder and owner of pharma
[SPEAKER_02]: G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nabi and Primo≈æ Zorec manager and co-green
Dior Dior, okay So no, we don't need that
[SPEAKER_02]: mic because the fourth guest is not coming
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everyone Let us start with the
position.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we have now in industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your stories?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your products?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you see your specific?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe with you Luca Friar So I've entered
the industry early 2014 with a product
[SPEAKER_05]: that was meant for dispensing cannabis
resin precise dispenser that led to a
[SPEAKER_05]: different so that that evolved to Project
in Macedonia where we where we have a
[SPEAKER_05]: license to grow medical cannabis that led
to the project in Slovenia which involved
[SPEAKER_05]: purchase of a GMP facility in copper that
later led to public offering of on the on
[SPEAKER_05]: the UK stock market that later left led to
money to which is the company I founded in
[SPEAKER_05]: 2019 and is now operating mostly in the
space of let's say Everyday use cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: so you can some people would call it
recreational cannabis some people would
[SPEAKER_05]: call it CBD cannabis some people would
call it cannabis a Whole cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: let's say products From a to Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is your annual turnover?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it profitable business?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a profitable business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes After many years of struggling in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: This this is actually profitable and The
turnover annual will see like last year
[SPEAKER_02]: was good this year is better Regarding the
legislation as we heard Do the legislators
[SPEAKER_02]: need some monetary push or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we say not it's not corruption,
but maybe some Some push from the from the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some offerings of some bonuses
That's what we heard on the former
[SPEAKER_02]: roundtable former panel Yeah, do you need
to lobby and Finance the I believe
[SPEAKER_05]: lobbying is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it have I've seen it done in the
States.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it Done in different
jurisdictions like Czech Republic where
[SPEAKER_05]: we're also moving part of our production
Lobbying definitely helps with the
[SPEAKER_05]: politicians, but in Slovenia, I don't need
to lobby with politicians They're actually
[SPEAKER_05]: very willing to make changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately, I think they don't have
the the power to to beat the let's say the
[SPEAKER_02]: Bureaucracy Okay, bureaucracy is an
obstacle Petra Marinko founder and owner
[SPEAKER_02]: of farmer G Nabi.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your product?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are we started six years six seven
years ago and We are we are creating I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying creating because it's a process of
creating things and I love to to wrap it
[SPEAKER_00]: like that We're creating a bit of
different kind of products with also
[SPEAKER_00]: extract and also other botanical extracts
we do skincare cosmetics and food
[SPEAKER_00]: supplements and We have a quite a big
range of different products that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: to offer to our customers so do you think
that the Potential cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_02]: should be unleashed in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we too close?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we need some?
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever legislation Change what do we
need?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you need personally?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the cannabis Stigma is getting
unleashed finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think because of events like this
talking about this in media it's showing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot in media these days and I think that's
really necessary for the Not only the
[SPEAKER_00]: business part, but also the healing part
of the the plant to proceed also to
[SPEAKER_00]: educate also politicians and medical
doctors and Staff that works with this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of things From my opinion Slovenia is
really open for this kind of Solutions
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis has to offer But I would
really be happy to see the regulation that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes within this because on the market we
we can find a lot of Things that shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: be there not only with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same with other ingredients that
show up in Cosmetics and food supplements
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on which shouldn't be there and are
toxic and so on and it's Ironically the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is always in front of the To be
understand where where they talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity but from what I've learned now
when we're We're in this six years that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing this a lot of ingredients
should be on the list before cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are so So many hormonal
disruptors so many cancerous ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in our everyday soaps and
Products that we use every day that should
[SPEAKER_00]: be really banned on the cannabis that can
only help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that so?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well It's not for me to say probably but
Pharma industry is one of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: probably is stopping the the business to
to grow and Also cosmetic business is is
[SPEAKER_00]: really really hard and really Profitable
and everything goes at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Cosmetic industries are using products
are using ingredients that are the
[SPEAKER_00]: cheapest because they can and it's allowed
to and Doing harmful things to to people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are using that is Not even a question
because it doesn't bring a profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really expensive to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've experienced it So your products
are in the field of cosmetics and you are
[SPEAKER_02]: actually taking some market share from the
cosmetic industry Well, yeah, we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: taking the big market share from the
cosmetic business but we we narrowed down
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a niche in niche so If I can if I
can say that because we are niche Using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis which is not that common and we
are also niche for using for for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: clean products and Non-toxic in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we every ingredient that we use is
Tested we don't use any hormonal
[SPEAKER_00]: disruptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: No our products don't use ingredients that
Cause allergies and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your annual?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say because I'm not looking
for is as annual turn turnover When I
[SPEAKER_00]: started this company, I started it with a
long-term goal and We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to admit that but I'm still
positive and thinking that we can come to
[SPEAKER_00]: the the goal that we put in on the table
six years ago and Hopefully think about
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we will talk about obstacles later,
but pretty much all it's what is your
[SPEAKER_01]: success story Well, I can correlate a
little bit with my colleagues before
[SPEAKER_01]: because My mission is to make people's
living a working environment better,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we are let's say we're looking from
perspective of the whole plant we use the
[SPEAKER_01]: straw that means Basically, we use fibers
and we are working in the field of
[SPEAKER_01]: building industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are offering to our clients whole
Humber based building solutions means
[SPEAKER_01]: houses made of which made of natural
materials leading Insulating with hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: hempcrete and hemp insulation so we want
we also want to Like flower part we also
[SPEAKER_01]: want to make a Better won't make a better
health for people because if you take a
[SPEAKER_01]: look from this perspective that we lead
But we spend our lifetime 70% in indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: basically So there is opposite of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a building industry which
promotes Materials that could be probably
[SPEAKER_01]: cheaper because of the economy of scale
now But there are very harmful for the
[SPEAKER_01]: people living in it and for the
environment we can see from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Construction side we can see from the
let's say from the perspective of life
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle assessment That which waste
construction waste is a big problem
[SPEAKER_01]: nowadays and we have to use because this
multi-purpose plan we have to use it all
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's crucial that we Connect to each
other and we start systematically We
[SPEAKER_01]: approach to to legislation Because also in
our building industry the current
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators are more let's say More on a
more more connected to let's say materials
[SPEAKER_01]: that are currently in a mass building
industry production, so Natural materials
[SPEAKER_01]: work differently like cannabis works
different differently also houses made
[SPEAKER_01]: with natural materials work differently,
so Our vision is That that we spread as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as possible our business model and to
help Establish the industry which is
[SPEAKER_01]: needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if bio industry is the base Of
everything since industrial cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any proposals for them any?
[SPEAKER_01]: legislative changes Industrial hemp is is
We have no problems with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't have resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's equality resources of fibers in
Slovenia Legislative is it's different
[SPEAKER_01]: area because building industry parameters
are very very strict, but they don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: established processes to be to create some
kind of Regulatives for natural materials
[SPEAKER_01]: like hemp etc So this is a gap how to
prepare the base for the billing with hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: Look a friar the pharmaceutical industry
did find some niche in this field
[SPEAKER_02]: regarding synthetical cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do they do?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean on the market So synthetical I mean
if you're referring to let's say drawn up
[SPEAKER_05]: in all form of THC that you can get in
pharmacies, which is synthetically
[SPEAKER_05]: processed CBD to get a pure substance,
which is then delta 9 THC There is also I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean, this is something that's okay in the
in the in the pharmacy in the
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmaceutical industry But we're seeing
now on the market in the Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a big let's say impact or a big
Massive turnover is going is happening on
[SPEAKER_05]: the market of also synthetic cannabinoids,
which are substitutes for THC They also
[SPEAKER_05]: derive from from CBD most of them and the
government started pretty much Regulate
[SPEAKER_05]: not regulating them but banning them,
you know Proposed to Czech Republic which
[SPEAKER_05]: actually decided to regulate them because
these are the only cannabinoids that I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean these cannabinoids are not Considered
and are not listed in the treaty the
[SPEAKER_05]: United Nations treaty.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Czech Republic saw an opportunity to
regulate these cannabinoids and And
[SPEAKER_05]: they're actually working extensively on
that Preparing guidelines so producers can
[SPEAKER_05]: now actually legally sell and produce the
synthetic cannabinoids The framework will
[SPEAKER_05]: will entail from from the standards you
need to meet in order to be able to get
[SPEAKER_05]: certified and registered and then there
will be also rules applied on how to
[SPEAKER_05]: distribute these products how to sell them
who can sell them and What the dosages are
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on and so on so certain
[SPEAKER_05]: Countries There's a pattern you can see
and All the countries that have strong THC
[SPEAKER_05]: lobby so Austria being the largest
producer of THC clones basically they
[SPEAKER_05]: supply whole Europe with Clones that are
that eventually end on the black market
[SPEAKER_05]: the products end on the black market plus
they supply most of the legal Cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: companies with these clones like Macedonia
for instance imports millions of these
[SPEAKER_05]: clones from Austria This is a country
where THC companies or companies involved
[SPEAKER_05]: in this THC business actually lobbied
against synthetic cannabinoids They
[SPEAKER_05]: achieved this listing very quickly Not
very efficiently also because they were
[SPEAKER_05]: rushing into it So they didn't manage to
to get all of them listed and there's no
[SPEAKER_05]: loopholes You know people still find ways
and and molecules that they can use and
[SPEAKER_05]: sell and so on So my opinion here
prohibition is it's again not the right
[SPEAKER_05]: way to go Regulation should be the way
that this thing should go forward
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now nothing is prohibited in
Slovenia so all these synthetic Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: according to the Let's say opinion from
the ministry these cannabinoids are not
[SPEAKER_05]: illegal They're legal to sell as chemicals
or fragrance products and so on for
[SPEAKER_05]: instance But they're actually considered I
mean we've we've had the unfortunate We're
[SPEAKER_05]: in an unfortunate situation where Customs
so ministry of Finances customs are
[SPEAKER_05]: seizing the packages because they don't
know what it is They don't know how to
[SPEAKER_05]: treat it and they have no no No response
to our requests to let us know what's
[SPEAKER_05]: going on with the packages These are the
packages that come to us from the from our
[SPEAKER_05]: customers so we just do service in this
business area and and it's impossible to
[SPEAKER_05]: get to a to a situation to a Resolution of
such situation because nobody really knows
[SPEAKER_05]: what's going on is legal is it not so
ministry thinks it's not illegal the
[SPEAKER_05]: ministry of so the customs Officers think
different obviously, but they don't
[SPEAKER_05]: communicate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in this space, there's a lot of Unknown
and therefore the regulating these things
[SPEAKER_02]: would be would make a lot of sense So this
is one of the reasons that you decided to
[SPEAKER_02]: move your company to Czech Republic No,
we're just moving a part of the company.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the part that has to do with the
service of What that we do for these
[SPEAKER_05]: customers?
[SPEAKER_05]: so that part of the production is moving
to Czech Republic and the Remainder so the
[SPEAKER_05]: the products the branded products what we
release on the market So Petra Marinko,
[SPEAKER_02]: could we say that there is a chaos on the
legislative field and what does that mean
[SPEAKER_00]: I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would say that it is What surprised me
when we started was that actually?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cosmetic industry is more regulated than
food supplements, which is kind of ironic
[SPEAKER_00]: because you stuff into you and can hardly
you and For example, we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: products on the market that come from
China with unknown origin With unknown
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients inside with that have nothing
to do with what they are Saying that's
[SPEAKER_00]: inside which is a really bad thing for all
the industry that is doing this But I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that Right regulation should be One
thing that Slovenia could lead on maybe in
[SPEAKER_00]: also in Europe and to be an example of a
good practice We've dealt with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different For example a lot of customers
come into our shop that we have in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ljubljana and they come with with Drops
that they bought somewhere on the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market or with someone else and say how is
this different than your product,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it I Cannot say about anybody how
how the things are different, but if we
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate it and make rules Okay,
you cannot you have to have Cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: levels checked for every batch which is
really important for a person that uses
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids as healing Addition or or or
cream or something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be easier also for
Customers to to get really good products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm pretty much all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we learn something from your story?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in the market for Several years,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how did you actually?
[SPEAKER_02]: Introduce your product regarding that you
are in the civil engineering business
[SPEAKER_01]: building houses was that easier Far from
that We struggled quite many years to I
[SPEAKER_01]: think the biggest problem is to gain Trust
in the in new materials and new approaches
[SPEAKER_01]: from customers Because there there there
was a few scientific evidence about
[SPEAKER_01]: advantages of the materials itself and the
Materials itself if I compare to existing
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, they are only focused on few
parameters or maybe one if we are talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about energy efficiency of the buildings,
etc but hemp materials in building in the
[SPEAKER_01]: building have many more advantages than
Than the existing let's say synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: materials which are not taking into
consideration of When doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers and etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the biggest struggle was to to convince
Customers that are many more advantages
[SPEAKER_01]: living in that kind of a building made
with hemp hemp create hemp insulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: etc But Going deep deep deep Through years
we we we gave We get many more evidences
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific evidences that confirms our
Marketing approach, let's say it's our
[SPEAKER_01]: sales approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started doing new houses We
developed our own systems Which are
[SPEAKER_01]: basically totally natural based
Diffusively open means it regulates
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture it has many more advantages that
are Measurable than any other material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we are we are already present the
market from 217 and We have three
[SPEAKER_01]: employees constantly employed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we are on a good way to expand now
Do you have any opportunities to change
[SPEAKER_02]: the legislation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we are all focuses on the energy
efficiency of houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you have some bonuses here We are
already in this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have all the certification in a
few months, I guess Regarding our
[SPEAKER_01]: materials and our let's say process itself
So it will be Totally aligned with the
[SPEAKER_01]: existing legislation in this way we are
changing things But we are financing by
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves everything and it's getting
slower otherwise if we will be finance
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Some other sources it will be
much easier and faster to gain this but
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say we already made Nowadays we are
talking a lot about carbon capture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to interrupt you right now But
this just in if you anybody here drive a
[SPEAKER_04]: white Audi q7 because you're parked in
front of a bus and they're upset about it
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right Listen you hot-wired I'll
drive it We won't be suspicious at all If
[SPEAKER_04]: you think you know who it is, it's
perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so very much carry on We're
talking about carbon capture and this
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental Impact etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we already made life cycle as analysis
of our materials and From the National
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute of Building and it shows that is
carbon negative material so means I Don't
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see and I don't Know about the
material that is carbon negative in
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are many more advantages that are
scientifically proved already which is in
[SPEAKER_01]: our favor and Pushes our sales forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So look our friar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We heard about the German model the second
pillar There are some projects scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: projects scientific research They plan to
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that help Slovenia as well if these
products would be involved in some
[SPEAKER_05]: scientific research So I've I've had the
chance to speak to a couple of companies
[SPEAKER_05]: in Switzerland who are involved in the
pilot programs that deal that have a
[SPEAKER_05]: permission permit permit and And are
already doing something on the so now I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: referring to the THC Market so Switzerland
has a couple of pilot programs each
[SPEAKER_05]: jurisdiction Decides when they want to do
it and then they give couple of licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were looking into one of those
Ourselves we see ourselves in this market
[SPEAKER_05]: also in the long run once it starts
becoming more let's say Easier to to get
[SPEAKER_05]: in now the this we're also in touch with
couple of German companies which are
[SPEAKER_05]: already working on the on the So called
Getting licenses for cannabis clubs
[SPEAKER_05]: meaning they can grow for other for other
people Which we could also call like kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of a pilot program from the German German
government which is Help yourself or have
[SPEAKER_05]: someone to do it for you And yes,
I think this this kind of programs are
[SPEAKER_05]: becoming more and more Thing that seems to
work for for other countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why not?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Slovenia could also try with
couple of pilot programs Define really
[SPEAKER_05]: well what what they want to achieve and
then not make things too complicated,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know make things in a way that Even
small companies can maybe come even maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: normal just regular people with know-how
and and the proper approach Try and do
[SPEAKER_05]: something on this field because it seems
like fighting this UN Treaty and other
[SPEAKER_05]: Regulations that prevent governments from
changing the law quickly and efficiently
[SPEAKER_05]: is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I would definitely endorse
Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you and your company be involved
in such a?
[SPEAKER_05]: Study would you be involved in so we've
tried to get licenses for for different
[SPEAKER_05]: studies So as I mentioned we had received
the license to produce medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_05]: Macedonia in 2017 at that time Macedonian
legislation had a part of the legislation
[SPEAKER_05]: said that you can only plant Strains that
are on Europe European seed list that was
[SPEAKER_05]: a complete Mistake in their legislation
because you couldn't grow there was no THC
[SPEAKER_05]: dominant plants on the so that led us to
the to to start the project in Slovenia we
[SPEAKER_05]: prepared everything with the faculty of
Agronomy and Faculty of Pharmacy in
[SPEAKER_05]: Ljubljana a really really quality project
And went to the Ministry of Health to
[SPEAKER_05]: apply for a research license We wanted to
breed new strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: So breeding strains that would eventually
be Listed on the European seed list
[SPEAKER_05]: because we've also learned in the process
that it's now possible to register strains
[SPEAKER_05]: with high THC in Holland and so we went
with that project to the Ministry of
[SPEAKER_05]: Health and We were really I mean surprised
with what kind of arrogance we were turned
[SPEAKER_05]: down in Slovenia in Slovenia as the You
want me to name name the person really
[SPEAKER_05]: Will this be on any news or So it was the
lady that was responsible at that time is
[SPEAKER_05]: Kirstin Petric So hers her point of view
was that only and until she is present in
[SPEAKER_05]: the ministry nobody but government
Institutes and bodies will be able to do
[SPEAKER_05]: research And or production that involves
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what did you do?
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to like Bow down and leave the
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were actually treated like we were some
criminals there almost like and I've had
[SPEAKER_05]: the honor to have two professors from the
University of Pharmacy in Ljubljana with
[SPEAKER_05]: me and one professor from University of
Agronomy and We left with a big I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: know how to say with the lump in our
throat.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really hard to digest
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we've also applied to our so to the
to get funds from the government to get
[SPEAKER_05]: this project approved there or Subsidized
and it was the same no success.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were graded very low with our project
Peter Mariko, what about your experiences?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so good ones In what way Regarding
your production legislation that come in
[SPEAKER_00]: this business Firstly the It was really
interesting when we started this I first
[SPEAKER_00]: went to the Health Ministry to get
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the regulations, please tell me
what are the limits and within within
[SPEAKER_00]: which limits should we be and there were
no clear answers for this thing and when
[SPEAKER_00]: we started we asked okay, is it legal to
put these products on the market because
[SPEAKER_00]: we know it's If SI European Food
Association Has this on a novel food least
[SPEAKER_00]: can we actually make food?
[SPEAKER_00]: supplements out of this or is it only
cosmetics and They said yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you can do them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's prohibited to do them You can do them
and if you make them Then there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation or no law that would give this
products out of the market and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: shocked and with the Lump in my throat
going out and say it was unimaginable how
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-regulated can one substance be on the
other hand, for example, I had interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: story from our production company And a
few others that we talked about at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time When we came with the list of
ingredients that we don't want in our
[SPEAKER_00]: products We want cannabis we want other
botanical extracts and there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: problem problem with rosemary and so on
but There was one thing that came Is
[SPEAKER_00]: staying in my mind and that is when I got
a question Why are you doing the list of
[SPEAKER_00]: products that you don't want inside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this list of products can make
your products Really cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your profit will be instead of this you
will get this and I was like, okay I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the dumbest person in the world,
but we have actually made a list of
[SPEAKER_00]: products that We of ingredients that we
don't want in our products because it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: Harmful So Peter this is like the story of
blind leading the blind when you go to the
[SPEAKER_02]: offices I mean, how do you actually decide
what to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: business-wise it's hard because
Business-wise you have to look for the
[SPEAKER_00]: profit eventually But I still believe that
Connecting people and Maybe gather people
[SPEAKER_00]: from different fields and giving a chance
like Luca said before maybe to regular
[SPEAKER_00]: people that know their stuff I think
that's the way to to implement changes
[SPEAKER_00]: into our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, Slovenia has a wonderful
chance right now with the flooding to show
[SPEAKER_00]: an example of good practice with Growing
cannabis in all the fields that are heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: polluted with Heavy metals that was in the
news 14 days ago and all the Pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can actually make Slovenia clean again
and We can do this with this magical Plant
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like It is magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people thought it's is there a story or
a person in bureaucracy that You dream of
[SPEAKER_01]: from time to time I'm person like I'm
trying to eliminate everything from my
[SPEAKER_01]: head that That wasn't so okay,
but it teaches me usually a lot and I turn
[SPEAKER_01]: around this Experience to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some stories It is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say funny stories if I'm going back
at my When I was finishing my study also
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I was making already a comparison
about From data that the word these times
[SPEAKER_01]: from hempcrete and other materials and One
professor it was doctor doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean double doctor I guess he had a
lot of knowledge about materials and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything asked me You that he was very
skeptical about Maintaining costs of that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of building and he said when you go
from time to time and cut the corner and
[SPEAKER_01]: roll it and smoke it so the maintaining
costs can go up up so It's very funny
[SPEAKER_01]: because he's smoking lime and hemp can be
very harmful for the but he didn't know I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess But in general and say in
institutions there There was a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: closed doors during years No, no subsidies
when I was trying to let's say help
[SPEAKER_01]: customers to gain subsidies for that kind
of build building solutions But there are
[SPEAKER_01]: there are already because there is an
initiative care for climate which is more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more present in building sector There
are more and more people also in
[SPEAKER_01]: government institutions that are That they
like very much that kind of bio-based
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically there was a lot of struggle
at the beginning but if you are consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: and Move forward move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look positive in every aspect of my life
So is there any question from the public Q
[SPEAKER_02]: &A?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe five minutes for Q&A because there
was a person Who wanted to ask something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes Wait, I have the microphone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm coming Okay, I would like to ask
Actually about your new new artificial
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids that you are doing are these
Molecules that are mimicking natural
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids or are these endogenous
endocannabinoids like molecules?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these molecules are also produced
by the plant because they're produced from
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD with the synthesis and enzyme
enzymatic processes you can also change
[SPEAKER_05]: the CBD to this other non-listed
cannabinoids which are not In nature,
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't find them in abundance at least
not so but they're quite easy and the
[SPEAKER_05]: technology is relatively inexpensive and
the production is Cost-effective and the
[SPEAKER_05]: product is really safe in the end because
it's basically just CBD, reagent,
[SPEAKER_05]: solvent usually and then purification when
you get the final result.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not actually involved in producing
any of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: We mostly We do the service of applying
these cannabinoids in a different
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoid I thought you are also using
them for some kind of pilot studies?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, we're mostly doing service
because we have a proprietary technology
[SPEAKER_05]: which we bought also in Slovenia I have to
say that there is this company this little
[SPEAKER_05]: startup that made this fantastic machine
that we're using and this kind of launched
[SPEAKER_05]: us to the international European markets
because it's the technology is really cool
[SPEAKER_05]: and they face good results so many
customers find us and we're scaling this
[SPEAKER_05]: production and then we do mostly we do the
service of let's say homogenizing we're
[SPEAKER_05]: now looking also into pharmaceutical
industry where we could with this device
[SPEAKER_05]: we can homogenize for instance flowers and
when you standardize a cannabis flower you
[SPEAKER_05]: got the top flowers range between 18 and
20 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: These flowers you register and then you
can sell them as active pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_05]: ingredient, but all the lower flowers on
the plant are lower in cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now this technology allows us to boost
or to take the extract from the lower
[SPEAKER_05]: quality plant material and apply it to the
material that has less active ingredient
[SPEAKER_05]: and therefore the producer can really use
the whole plant as something so you can
[SPEAKER_05]: you can homogenize with this technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: For instance this is a direction we're
looking into right now trying to offer our
[SPEAKER_05]: service to some of the medical cannabis
companies because it's also in the medical
[SPEAKER_05]: industry the holy grail is how much THC or
how much active ingredient you can give to
[SPEAKER_05]: your customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's new green technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any other question?
[SPEAKER_02]: I
[SPEAKER_07]: have a question about marketing because I
know that there is sometimes problems to
[SPEAKER_07]: reach the customers.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some problems with social media
in general banning the marketing of the
[SPEAKER_07]: product so I'm interested in how do you
overcome these problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can answer this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard, very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example on Facebook with our page Nabi
we cannot even say it's a beautiful sunny
[SPEAKER_00]: day outside because and sponsor it because
the because we sell CBD and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibited and we sell CBD which is legal
which we can sell in our shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can sell it online everywhere but it's
illegal to put a post about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried different approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't use influencers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a special reason for that and I'm
not that sorry that we didn't and we tried
[SPEAKER_00]: in Slovenia for example we did some
interesting moves that were not known
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example we were selling our products
in 90 drug remark shops or 100 in Slovenia
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a big thing to be in every
village in Slovenia and nobody knew about
[SPEAKER_00]: us so we made a product which were a pack
of gummies that cost seven euro and
[SPEAKER_00]: something and the big pack that costs I
don't know 20 and to approach the
[SPEAKER_00]: customers we did the small packaging which
was totally unprofitable for us because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the packaging and the aluminum boxes and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive so we kind of did the
marketing part with this kind of product
[SPEAKER_00]: and it showed off that it showed up that
people are buying the small packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: packages because it's not that much money
to try products and the next month the
[SPEAKER_00]: people were buying I don't know the sale
of the big package was tripled four times
[SPEAKER_00]: so it was growing eventually and we
gathered a lot of customers in this way
[SPEAKER_00]: and another interesting story was we since
we didn't put a lot of money into the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing into the paper I don't know
newspapers and so on we invested this into
[SPEAKER_00]: giving away our products so the customer
has his own its own experience to unpack
[SPEAKER_00]: it to try it in the safety of their home
to see that there's no THC inside I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: feel any bad reactions out of it and
people started buying our stuff because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that so we for example we gave away 500
gummies or gave away 500 body oils to
[SPEAKER_00]: people to try it and we got actually 80%
repurchase out of that so that was a big
[SPEAKER_00]: thing for any cosmetic product we know
women never try never change their cream
[SPEAKER_00]: and we kind of did that so I think you can
do it it's hard also because for example
[SPEAKER_00]: we didn't even try to beat Google we could
do that with a lot of expenses and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything we didn't even try it but we
showed up in every conference that there
[SPEAKER_00]: was so we were there we were trying to
educate people we try to approach
[SPEAKER_00]: newspapers with informative content that
they need for their newspapers and so on
[SPEAKER_00]: so it was it's kind of more talking about
the plant about the cleanliness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product then how our product is good I
never spoke about how good is our product
[SPEAKER_00]: that I speak about ingredients and the
mixes and mostly what is harmful and
[SPEAKER_00]: people are really eager to know about this
thank you so much just half of the
[SPEAKER_02]: sentence because you came I just wanted to
say that we saw that maybe the emerging
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis opportunities for Slovenians our
startups spin-offs together with
[SPEAKER_02]: universities maybe if you agree I would
that would be maybe the conclusion and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's your work thank you so very much
let's hear it once again for our panel
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to take a 15-minute break we
have coffees and croissants out there
[SPEAKER_04]: please please go to the exhibitor hall
please check out some of the exhibits
[SPEAKER_04]: Petra will be in there you can talk to her
about Navier and all the other things and
[SPEAKER_04]: donate to the Lions Club to help the flood
victims we'll be here in 15 minutes 1545
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll be right back thank you you you
