[SPEAKER_01]: Canada is in many ways has been leading
the global marketplace in cannabis both in
[SPEAKER_01]: their own country and exporting to other
countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will soon be legalizing for all
adults cannabis commerce across the nation
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm going to introduce the moderator
who will handle the rest of the panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's really an all-around rock star
pioneer in the British Columbia cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the director for Gover Relations for
MMJ Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is the director of BC Independent
Cannabis Alliance and a partner with
[SPEAKER_01]: Groundworks Consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please give a warm welcome for Ms. Jamie
Shaw.
[SPEAKER_07]: So our panel is called Greening the North
and obviously we're going to be talking
[SPEAKER_07]: about a lot of Canadian specific details.
[SPEAKER_07]: But our goal is to kind of give you an
overview of what it looks like when an
[SPEAKER_07]: industrialized nation legalizes cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the different things that happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got an amazingly diverse panel here
right now that represents a wide variety
[SPEAKER_07]: of stakeholders within the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: First we have Clint and Young.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clint is CEO of MMJ Canada which has eight
stores and growing across Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got licenses in two different
municipalities right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clint works closely with the Lost
Organizations it's a mental health
[SPEAKER_07]: division that reflects Clint's main focus
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called the Living Outside Suffering
Trauma and it provides services to
[SPEAKER_07]: homeless or the underhomed that need some
support because they're also suffering
[SPEAKER_07]: from mental illnesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: So please welcome Clint Young.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up we have Nick Pateras.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the vice president growth of Lyft
Company Limited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Canada's leading cannabis media technology
and product platform.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would also point out it's pretty much
the only cannabis industry specific media
[SPEAKER_07]: rather than just cannabis news.
[SPEAKER_07]: With a mission to empower informed
cannabis decisions Lyft collects and
[SPEAKER_07]: disseminates big data with the goal of
bridging informational gaps between buyers
[SPEAKER_07]: and sellers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please welcome Nick Pateras.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up is Robert Laurie.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's an international lawyer writer and
speaker qualified as a solicitor in both
[SPEAKER_07]: England and in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was Robert's also the chairman advisory
board that's actually changed aren't you
[SPEAKER_07]: actually a director of Liberty Leaf?
[SPEAKER_07]: No chairman of the advisory board.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Canadian based public company which
also is Will Raskin.
[SPEAKER_07]: He comes to Liberty Leaf with 25 years
experience in the investment brokerage
[SPEAKER_07]: industry most recently as a partner senior
investment advisor with Northern
[SPEAKER_07]: Securities.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just before we kind of get into the
this I'm going to give a very brief and
[SPEAKER_07]: very condensed version of how Canada
actually sort of got to where we are right
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 1969 the then Liberal government
decided that it wanted to do a study on
[SPEAKER_07]: illegal drugs and on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was called the Le Dain Commission.
[SPEAKER_07]: Took them three years.
[SPEAKER_07]: When they came back they actually
recommended that cannabis be legalized.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing was actually done about that at
all for quite a few years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before there was any more kind of
government movement on this there were
[SPEAKER_07]: battles in the courts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of battles in the courts and so
courts had decided that patients had right
[SPEAKER_07]: to access.
[SPEAKER_07]: That they had right to have someone else
grow for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: That that person could grow for more than
one person then more than two persons.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually just a constant fight for
about 20 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: While that was going on dispensaries sort
of exploded as a gray market option.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them are actually now licensed in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2014-2015 when the ACMPR was launched.
[SPEAKER_07]: At that point we had the first sort of
fully functioning legal medical system.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately it still didn't work for
everybody in the country particularly
[SPEAKER_07]: those that were already being serviced by
dispensaries that had a wider variety of
[SPEAKER_07]: product that they were allowed to carry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Were allowed to talk about the product
more than the licensed producers were.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in 2015 we got court cases again
decided we're gonna have edibles at some
[SPEAKER_07]: point and other forms of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have an oil that was introduced
legally following that court decision but
[SPEAKER_07]: that's all we've actually seen on that at
this point.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've put medical on hold.
[SPEAKER_07]: We you know in 2015 we elected the first
political party to really run on a
[SPEAKER_07]: platform of full legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: They won and we've been sort of waiting to
see what's gonna happen with that first.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been very clear we're not talking
about medical we're not gonna adjust it or
[SPEAKER_07]: do anything it's just gonna stay in place.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll look at it later after we've got
some data back from legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know we're gonna have edibles but
they're not even gonna start talking about
[SPEAKER_07]: that for another year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we know that that's coming eventually.
[SPEAKER_07]: The government's been making some huge
strides in terms of easing some of the
[SPEAKER_07]: burdens on the large licenses creating
classes for smaller licenses including
[SPEAKER_07]: microproducer microprocessor and some
nursery licenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're seeing a lot of movement but we
haven't seen any sort of applications yet
[SPEAKER_07]: for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And provinces are starting to roll out
their retail models where in the east
[SPEAKER_07]: they're mostly gonna be controlled by
government stores and in the west they're
[SPEAKER_07]: mostly gonna be private retail mostly
still have to buy from the government in
[SPEAKER_07]: between.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that sort of as a context of where
we are overall in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clint where are you and MMJ exactly at
within all of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit complex for us because
we are a Canada-wide based dispenser
[SPEAKER_02]: industry which meaning each province sets
its own regulations and as Jamie said
[SPEAKER_02]: Ontario where we're very strong based out
of we're having issues with the government
[SPEAKER_02]: they want to have full control overall
distribution and all levels of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am working hard right now with
municipalities and lobbying provincial
[SPEAKER_02]: government because of the election coming
up to have us carved in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either a medicinal and or recreational
component I'm not quite sure yet how it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: look.
[SPEAKER_02]: For MMJ Canada on the west coast we have
two licenses and one in a variance with
[SPEAKER_02]: the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us it's it's we have to be very
patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said this last year when I was here we
had to be very patient and a year later I
[SPEAKER_02]: still have to be very patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's getting closer to legalization
it's getting closer to us figuring out
[SPEAKER_02]: which path we're going to be going.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are trying to vertically integrate our
company on many other levels but as of
[SPEAKER_02]: right now we have to let the the
government kind of unroll platforms and we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to kind of make our next move a very
strategic one because it could make or
[SPEAKER_02]: break us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Nick so you guys just announced that
you're going public which is kind of big
[SPEAKER_07]: news because that hasn't been on the
horizon for most people.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: What has been going on for you guys?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do you fit within all of this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah so we play a role in bridging the
informational gap between buyer and
[SPEAKER_03]: seller.
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially we're Canada's largest
cannabis media and tech company whether
[SPEAKER_03]: that's through our events, our educational
content or our data solutions and training
[SPEAKER_03]: services.
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially the need that we've
identified and the role we play is as I
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned closing the informational gap or
the informational asymmetry between buyer
[SPEAKER_03]: and seller.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so where there's been extremely tight
advertising restrictions and promotional
[SPEAKER_03]: tactics that have been prohibited by the
government in the past we try to do the
[SPEAKER_03]: best to inform and empower patients to
make informed cannabis decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was true in today's market in the
medical world it'll be even more true in
[SPEAKER_03]: the adult use world and so our role
becomes important because we know that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of consumers will come
online for the first time or consumers who
[SPEAKER_03]: have been buying the category for a number
of years but just unfamiliar with what a
[SPEAKER_03]: legal market looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the idea is to cultivate and
disseminate the information to help people
[SPEAKER_03]: make those decisions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Rob you know you and I are kind of all
over the place with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got our fingers in a bunch of
different pies.
[SPEAKER_07]: But overall how's Adlussum, where is it
positioned within this whole framework?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I'm in a very unique position because
I grew up in the black market but I also
[SPEAKER_05]: have a law degree from Oxford University
and I used to work in capital markets in
[SPEAKER_05]: the city of London and on Wall Street.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually one of the firms I used to work
at was the CIA's law firm Sullivan and
[SPEAKER_05]: Cromwell on Wall Street.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I was done with that work and went
back to Vancouver my hometown I set up
[SPEAKER_05]: shop with my own law practice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well because again I was known in the
industry and had training education and
[SPEAKER_05]: experience that is certainly of value to
any emerging industry let alone the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis space I've been very busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so with that we've seen a tremendous
amount of change from a few people with
[SPEAKER_05]: pot to now everybody involved with pot or
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the pride for me is that legalization
in Canada has been driven by a court
[SPEAKER_05]: process.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually the people who've taken the
federal government to court and we have in
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada what's called the Charter of Rights
and Freedoms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And under the Charter we have Section 7
which is life, liberty and security of the
[SPEAKER_05]: person.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's basically through that
fundamental right that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: program in Canada legally has started
going back as far as 2002.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rushing fast forward to today what we're
seeing and again why it's exciting and
[SPEAKER_05]: frustrating for me at the same time is
we're seeing lots of interesting endeavors
[SPEAKER_05]: and enterprise in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: However those who have been the pioneers
of the market, those who have been the
[SPEAKER_05]: ones who've gone to jail for the right to
grow cannabis or to produce medicine are
[SPEAKER_05]: not necessarily allowed to participate in
this new market.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact Justin Trudeau our Prime Minister
love him or hate him I have mixed feelings
[SPEAKER_05]: about him personally but his agenda with
legalization is threefold right.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is to make our streets and communities
safer okay that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remove the black market and keep and make
it safe for children.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of those are noble endeavors but the
execution of them when you actually get
[SPEAKER_05]: behind and look at how cannabis is being
legally regulated in Canada it's rather
[SPEAKER_05]: suspect that those goals and endeavors
will happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So really to sum up here I'm seeing a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: If this marijuana industry was like a
roulette game I see red and black,
[SPEAKER_05]: legal illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: The difficulty however is until we know
what the actual rules and the regulations
[SPEAKER_05]: look like anyone out there who's an
entrepreneur is not going to know whether
[SPEAKER_05]: to put their chips on red or black or what
number and then to leverage to get an
[SPEAKER_05]: investment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm confident and I'm also excited that
as we do see the rules and regulations in
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada begin to normalize and level out
we're going to see even greater
[SPEAKER_05]: entrepreneurship but at the same time I
also want to see greater inclusion from
[SPEAKER_05]: the original OG pioneers if you will who
got us this far.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so with that and either way you look
at it Canada is a very exciting market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So glad that we're here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah and you bring up a very important
point.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean one of the weird things to me about
this whole legalization thing is that
[SPEAKER_07]: they're using the same tools that they
used in prohibition.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's still some lessons I think to
be learned.
[SPEAKER_07]: Will where do you and your company all fit
within this what's been going on in
[SPEAKER_07]: Canada?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well first of all I'm thankful that Rob is
the chairman of our advisory board because
[SPEAKER_04]: I just let him do all the talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So but with that said I can speak from the
perspective of a publicly listed company
[SPEAKER_04]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went through the transition a couple of
years ago like many cannabis startups.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went from the mining industry which was
depressed to going through the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: change of business scenario and becoming a
listed public company in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: sector.
[SPEAKER_04]: And through that process you know we've
been able to acquire two late stage
[SPEAKER_04]: applicants under the ACNPR program which
is the path one needs to take to have a
[SPEAKER_04]: license to grant you the opportunity to
cultivate and sell product in the
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal space right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know the opportunity I see for
Canadian publicly traded companies is
[SPEAKER_04]: we're really at the tip of the spear when
it comes to raising capital and deploying
[SPEAKER_04]: that capital internationally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So specific to Liberty Leaf you know we're
listed in Canada on the CSE.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're listed in the OTCQB in the states
and we're listed here in Frankfurt or in
[SPEAKER_04]: Frankfurt in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the reason I wanted to come to this
conference was to learn more about the
[SPEAKER_04]: aptitude for the German cannabis investor
and you know from what I can see today
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a lot of interest in cannabis in
investing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the where we fit in the mix here is
you know we're able to raise capital,
[SPEAKER_04]: deploy capital internationally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do feel that the Canadian sector per se
is getting a little saturated when it
[SPEAKER_04]: comes to licenses and and what have you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the opportunity we have again having
the platform of being able to raise
[SPEAKER_04]: capital is to deploy that whether it's in
Germany or Greece or Malta or you name it
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever the countries are are bringing
medicinal legislation to the table we want
[SPEAKER_04]: to be we want to be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also just want to apologize I shouldn't
have sat next to Clint.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like if we went to high school
together we'd have been the kids in the
[SPEAKER_07]: back of the class just joking kicked out
every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the big things for me that was the
biggest surprise in the legalization
[SPEAKER_07]: process was the inclusion of the different
classes of licenses that kind of came out
[SPEAKER_07]: of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a big step as you know an
advocate lobbyist that took about five
[SPEAKER_07]: years off my career.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was kind of surprised to see that
happen so quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: What were some of the biggest surprises
for you Clint?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well the biggest surprise was the fact
that everybody's surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the government is leaving it up to
the provinces.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that everyone in my industry
seems to be shocked that the government is
[SPEAKER_02]: going about it the way it is when in
reality no one should be shocked.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've always wanted to have a strong
control which is understandable.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've always kind of done things the way
they want and I think in my industry you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to be prepared for anything that the
government's going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're only one dimensional you're
going to be in a lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you need to be able to have your
fingers in all pots in all aspects of the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry so you can prepare for the worst
and or the best depending on how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government has made it clear that
they're going to leave it up to each
[SPEAKER_02]: province.
[SPEAKER_02]: In no surprise to me that each province is
going about it drastically differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I was surprised a little bit that
there wasn't any inclusion of a dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: model in Ontario at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like really no even talk about it,
no ifs, ands or buts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems like now with the new
election there might be some hope for that
[SPEAKER_02]: so we'll again have to be patient and wait
and see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for myself I think what I was maybe not
surprised about but perhaps I would like
[SPEAKER_03]: to see the government show more movement
on is the treatment of medical cannabis is
[SPEAKER_03]: distinct from adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The regulations right now are very focused
on the recreational markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it has been a sprint since the
government announced the bill on April
[SPEAKER_03]: 13th of last year but with every iteration
of regulations that are released we
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to see that there actually isn't
a robust enough distinction between the
[SPEAKER_03]: medical market and the non-medical market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by way of example medical cannabis in
Canada is still taxed unlike any other
[SPEAKER_03]: prescription medication.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also proposing an excise tax on
certain medical products once the bill
[SPEAKER_03]: comes into play in the fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: The packaging regulations that were
released a couple months ago dictates that
[SPEAKER_03]: packaging for medical cannabis must be the
same as non-medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: What it actually looks like is completely
plain packaging with a list of health
[SPEAKER_03]: warnings and a massive red stop sign that
says warning THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're a patient and you're looking
to medicate and this is a medicine that
[SPEAKER_03]: actually unlocks for you a day's worth of
functioning fully where previous forms of
[SPEAKER_03]: treatment were not, effective for you and
you receive your medicine like that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not the type of patients not type of
health care we like to deliver in Canada
[SPEAKER_03]: and yet that is the reality we're facing
now and so I'd like to see more of a
[SPEAKER_03]: distinction between the medical and the
adult use markets and though there is a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of noise around the recreational side
of things and rightly so it is a massive
[SPEAKER_03]: market and a massive opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We mustn't forget the patients who got us
to where we are today those who fought in
[SPEAKER_03]: the courts who have advocated for decades
and ensured that their access to their
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine is not limited and we're
potentially have that in jeopardy if we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't take the right steps now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah and that's been one of the concerning
things about the liberal platform you know
[SPEAKER_07]: they first came out with it in 2013 way
before they were in power and and they
[SPEAKER_07]: just never looked at medical there was
never anything medical it's a little
[SPEAKER_07]: frustrating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just gonna say I mean I think that
we recognize there's only a small
[SPEAKER_03]: percentage of people who actually go
through the legal medical channels so
[SPEAKER_03]: right now 19% of consumers who report that
they use cannabis primarily for medical
[SPEAKER_03]: purposes go through the legal channels
that is you know a comment on access it's
[SPEAKER_03]: a comment on price it's a comment on a lot
of things actually we need to do more
[SPEAKER_03]: convenience we need to do more to ensure
that patients are treated as patients
[SPEAKER_03]: distinct from a recreational consumer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well and the really interesting thing is a
large part of that percentage that you
[SPEAKER_07]: just mentioned are new patients that ACMP
are actually opened up access to people in
[SPEAKER_07]: rural areas that didn't have access before
so it was basically a new market that kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of came in and opened up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob what was the biggest surprise for you
about liberal legalization?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well yes actually I have Jamie Shaw to
thank for the biggest surprise I mean
[SPEAKER_05]: Clint rightly hit on that when it comes to
government money and control there aren't
[SPEAKER_05]: surprises that's their two MOs but the
biggest surprise that Jamie and informed
[SPEAKER_05]: me about was when we started looking at
the new ACMP are or no excuse me the bill
[SPEAKER_05]: c-45 cannabis act now I know the Germans
like a good scary story the brothers grim
[SPEAKER_05]: right here's something pretty grim so when
you read the definition of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_05]: then you go to the cross-reference
schedule one and schedule one the
[SPEAKER_05]: definition this is the scary part says
that the definition of cannabis includes
[SPEAKER_05]: all phyto cannabinoids derived from
cannabis and non cannabis derived sources
[SPEAKER_05]: or similar to or similar to so basically
let me boil that down why I find that so
[SPEAKER_05]: scary and unforgivable is it's not the
government's job to say if you don't get
[SPEAKER_05]: your phyto cannabinoids from us you're
going to jail that's a slippery slope from
[SPEAKER_05]: if you don't get your water from us you're
going to jail you don't get your food from
[SPEAKER_05]: us or if your food is not prepared in the
way that we say so you're going to jail so
[SPEAKER_05]: ultimately the scariest thing about bill
c-45 is the degree of control by which if
[SPEAKER_05]: you're doing anything outside the circle
we'll call it the sacred circle of
[SPEAKER_05]: legality if you do anything outside that
or produce phyto cannabinoids the same
[SPEAKER_05]: phyto cannabinoids that you can get from
kale and echinacea you technically can get
[SPEAKER_05]: from cannabis so I mean is anyone else not
alarmed about that it's it's again and if
[SPEAKER_05]: these laws are not challenged the scary
thing is this gives government an
[SPEAKER_05]: unfettered control over essential aspects
of human life and I see cannabis being one
[SPEAKER_05]: more step to where governments will be
able to try to control plant life organic
[SPEAKER_05]: material which again next thing you know
will be cloning so that's the scary thing
[SPEAKER_05]: is that people see the this is just oh
it's a cannabis it's a medicine it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: weed tax it move on ultimately I think is
a fundamental human freedom around access
[SPEAKER_05]: to a substance that we all need for
survival but for the last 93 years have
[SPEAKER_05]: been denied by the government so yes I
find that quite surprising and scary
[SPEAKER_07]: thanks trap well what's kind of been the
biggest surprise for you in this process
[SPEAKER_04]: well you know not so much surprising it's
I think from our perspective as a pub Co
[SPEAKER_04]: we just have to adapt and be nimble in in
our sort of approach to cannabis so a good
[SPEAKER_04]: example would be the the recent advent of
the micro cultivator status and the it
[SPEAKER_04]: just sort of dovetailed quite nicely with
our distribution sales only license that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're on we've got a late-stage
application through the Health Canada ACM
[SPEAKER_04]: PR process but what that means is the
micro cultivators are the the smaller MMA
[SPEAKER_04]: our growers that the the government wants
to basically roll into the the program
[SPEAKER_04]: here and so the advent of that level of
licensing will allow those individuals to
[SPEAKER_04]: continue to grow but they cannot sell
direct to the public so specific to
[SPEAKER_04]: Liberty Leaf with our distribution only
license those micro cultivators will be we
[SPEAKER_04]: be a partnership with those growers and so
again and then we would take that product
[SPEAKER_04]: and take to the two directly to the market
to the retail consumer so not so much
[SPEAKER_04]: surprising on our end it's just all about
adapting with you know the ever-changing
[SPEAKER_04]: rules and goalposts that that come our way
I think another good surprise as well as
[SPEAKER_07]: the licenses was the changes to hemp
regulations that was another kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: unexpected thing that came in our old hemp
regulations were ridiculous you could
[SPEAKER_07]: basically grow the hemp and then had to
destroy the rest of the plant you weren't
[SPEAKER_07]: allowed to extract any CBD or use the
roots or do anything else with it and
[SPEAKER_07]: that's that's eased up a lot so I think
that was another kind of nice surprise
[SPEAKER_07]: other than you know the space that we're
in is is very rapidly evolving and
[SPEAKER_07]: changing all the time other than some of
those what have been sort of the specific
[SPEAKER_07]: issues or challenges that that you have
with your company and how it's positioned
[SPEAKER_02]: and how regulations are coming one of the
major challenges we've had with MMJ Canada
[SPEAKER_02]: is that each province is drastically
different per regulations so you get
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable with a way you're doing
something in the industry for example in
[SPEAKER_02]: Vancouver and then they announced a
regulation in Alberta and you're filing
[SPEAKER_02]: and doing an application that's something
completely out of your realm and not what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're used to doing the the fear of the
unknown of where I'm going to get my
[SPEAKER_02]: supply in the future how many licenses I'm
going to have is it's not concerning but
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it's definitely something I think
about on a daily basis so where I see
[SPEAKER_02]: myself in the space is that we got to be
very vigilant on on how we approach each
[SPEAKER_02]: province I think we need to do a lot of
education on each province Jamie also
[SPEAKER_02]: works for MMJ Canada as a government
relations director so having her on my
[SPEAKER_02]: team is really eased up a lot of the
things and the processes for each province
[SPEAKER_02]: because she is an educator and she
investigates into each province on how
[SPEAKER_02]: they operate so that's made my life a lot
easier moving forward I think it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be key on who you partner with key on
your standard key on your product testing
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think if you cross all your t's and
dot your i's you have a good chance of
[SPEAKER_02]: longevity in the cannabis space as long as
you're willing to adapt so we talked a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit about one of the things that
you're doing but what have been some of
[SPEAKER_07]: the challenges that you're seeing coming
and I think where we position ourselves at
[SPEAKER_03]: the center of education and introducing
and welcoming new people into the into the
[SPEAKER_03]: market whether that is regulated consumers
or non-consumers or business people it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just ensuring that we're deconstructing
that stigma that still it still remains a
[SPEAKER_03]: problem probably not in a room like this
but the reality is that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: still continue to harbor a demonization of
the plant and so where we have to work
[SPEAKER_03]: extra hard is to deconstruct that Pona
potheads donor archetype that really
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't resemble anything but the unwanted
poster child and so for us where we have
[SPEAKER_03]: you know 250 odd thousand medical patients
through the legal channels now and we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: have five to maybe up to eight million
consumers come online as a result of
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization a lot of these people have no
idea how cannabis interacts with the body
[SPEAKER_03]: they have no idea what the different
molecular compounds are the difference
[SPEAKER_03]: between you know THC and CBD and and all
the other ones I mean it's it's a fun
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity to be able to educate them
when you can speak about some of the the
[SPEAKER_03]: details that people may not be familiar
with for example I love talking about the
[SPEAKER_03]: myth that cannabis necessarily induces the
munchies if you talk about a cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: like THC V tetrahydrocannabivorin it's a
very effective appetite suppressant and so
[SPEAKER_03]: can be used in weight loss routines these
are the kinds of conversations that had
[SPEAKER_03]: people take a step back where they thought
they already knew something and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: really helping them you know swim across
that lake of misinformation and so to your
[SPEAKER_03]: question the biggest challenge we have is
education because people are coming from a
[SPEAKER_03]: place of at best ignorance at worst
opposition because of the results of 95
[SPEAKER_07]: years of prohibition yeah absolutely and
the previous speaker also referred to one
[SPEAKER_07]: of the things around this is that we don't
actually know that much about cannabis for
[SPEAKER_07]: as long as we've been using it within our
new scientific system we don't really know
[SPEAKER_07]: and most of the research that we're doing
isn't really telling us anything because
[SPEAKER_07]: we don't know what cannabinoid profile was
tested how many what the terpene levels
[SPEAKER_07]: were it would be a very simple fix to just
you know if you're gonna do research maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: find out what it is first but yeah and
that's I think a responsibility the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry needs to take on where the result
of almost a decade of prohibition in
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada at least results in you know two
different extremes where you have one
[SPEAKER_03]: extreme of people making therapeutic and
medical claims about the plant that aren't
[SPEAKER_03]: backed by clinical late stage clinical
studies and you also have one the other
[SPEAKER_03]: end of the extreme where people are
convinced that cannabis consumption leads
[SPEAKER_03]: to rape violence murder and so on and
realistically we know neither of those are
[SPEAKER_03]: really supported by science the truth like
most things live somewhere in the middle
[SPEAKER_03]: and so that's where we aim to insert
ourselves so it's our responsibility to be
[SPEAKER_03]: very particular with our words and and
admit where we don't have all the facts
[SPEAKER_03]: where we're doing more to learn more about
them thank you yeah Rob what do you what
[SPEAKER_07]: do you see coming in terms of issues
whether and you know specific to the work
[SPEAKER_05]: that you do well I see more of the same
really I've made a career of essentially
[SPEAKER_05]: being a bit of a thorn in the side of
government if you will in a good way I've
[SPEAKER_05]: also well been knowing I've helped
government I've recently been appointed to
[SPEAKER_05]: a municipal cannabis task force and I
guess what it comes all down to is like my
[SPEAKER_05]: colleagues have said is there's education
and they're standing up for instances
[SPEAKER_05]: involving cannabis where you see an
injustice happening ignorance or you see
[SPEAKER_05]: people being put down because of their
cannabis use or making false assumptions
[SPEAKER_05]: due to cannabis I mean really as a
conscientious cannabis user to step up in
[SPEAKER_05]: those those those situations we're going
to see certainly a lot more well I look at
[SPEAKER_05]: it this way there's the folks that are
getting licensed and and so on and I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: happy to represent a number of those
clients but I also represent probably the
[SPEAKER_05]: 95% who are getting screwed by Health
Canada so there's gonna be no shortage of
[SPEAKER_05]: work that will continue unfortunately and
until we as Nick pointed out we have and
[SPEAKER_05]: we see that from the government a little
bit more clarity in the direction upon
[SPEAKER_05]: which they're going to take things it'll
be very it'll just I think continue to be
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit of more of the same in that
regard that change will continue to come
[SPEAKER_05]: to the courts government will continue to
do what it will do in its best interest
[SPEAKER_05]: and citizens of course have the obligation
to engage in legal methods of changing the
[SPEAKER_05]: law but at the same time the success that
we've achieved with cannabis at least in
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada Canada has come through you know
decades of civil disobedience and I think
[SPEAKER_05]: we're going to see more of that too so
it's an exciting time for a lawyer I mean
[SPEAKER_05]: I really look at it with my law firm being
you know add loose some law corporation
[SPEAKER_05]: it's my ship and I'm sailing right into a
perfect storm with which is exciting but
[SPEAKER_05]: if I hadn't been doing what I've been
doing for like the last two decades of my
[SPEAKER_05]: practice I wouldn't be ready for these
changes and I believe I am ready for these
[SPEAKER_05]: changes because I've done what's been
necessary every day to prepare for these.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bill C-45 sister bill C-46 is going to
keep you pretty busy too because it's not
[SPEAKER_07]: that impaired driving rates are going to
go up but charges certainly are.
[SPEAKER_05]: The noose will be tightened around
everybody's neck which is why it's
[SPEAKER_05]: imperative that you understand these laws
and how they affect you because I think
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to realize that cannabis
regulation is going to pervade so many
[SPEAKER_05]: aspects of human rights civil society and
and what we consider normal tenants of
[SPEAKER_05]: being being a community those will all be
challenged.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah I mean we've already seen that with
medical patients that have won the right
[SPEAKER_07]: to grow but if they're renting from
somebody the landlord doesn't have to let
[SPEAKER_07]: them grow on their property so really it's
only if you have a house that you can
[SPEAKER_07]: actually grow if you have need medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Will what's what's coming for you guys in
terms of issues or challenges?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for the the PubCo perspective the
challenge for us is just to stay focused
[SPEAKER_04]: there's so many opportunities to to invest
in the cannabis sector and whether it's in
[SPEAKER_04]: you know in our own backyard in Canada and
going through the the typical ACMPR
[SPEAKER_04]: process and getting licensed because at
the end of the day that's your ticket to
[SPEAKER_04]: participating in in the business to you
know internationally the opportunities
[SPEAKER_04]: internationally or it could it be in in in
science and R&D is it in CBD pet products
[SPEAKER_04]: which we're involved with with a
partnership in Israel.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many opportunities that that
were shown that the the challenge for me
[SPEAKER_04]: as a CEO is just to stay focused and but
but that's that's a good problem to have
[SPEAKER_04]: because we get we have a lot of
opportunities that we we vet and and
[SPEAKER_04]: thankfully we have the the capital that if
we do see an opportunity that we like and
[SPEAKER_04]: and and fits the bill then then we can
react so that's probably a good challenge
[SPEAKER_02]: and really quickly just to touch up on
kind of what all of us have been speaking
[SPEAKER_02]: about it seems like Canada's going through
looking Rob said at one point a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: grim transition it's really not so bad
from all the challenges that you hear us
[SPEAKER_02]: going through all the the ups and downs
it's it's quite a blessing to be a part of
[SPEAKER_02]: this you know the fact that I'm working
with somebody like Nick who's a part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the media company that it's not on the
dispensing side the fact that I'm friends
[SPEAKER_02]: with somebody like will who is essentially
a competition he's a licensed producer
[SPEAKER_02]: which is awesome the fact is that we're
all up here and when you find good people
[SPEAKER_02]: in the industry you learn to work with
each other and you start putting your
[SPEAKER_02]: heads together and you start doing some
pretty impressive things so I just don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want Germany to think that what we're
going through is all trials and
[SPEAKER_02]: tribulations it's it's a pretty awesome
experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually let me qualify on that it is
pretty awesome and let me make it clear we
[SPEAKER_05]: are transitioning from a time where people
aren't necessarily going to jail anymore
[SPEAKER_05]: for roaches or joints or you know for for
inconsequential issues regarding cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: so I think we've turned a real page there
where now we're going to see instead of
[SPEAKER_05]: you know the traditional arrests for
possession and trafficking we're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: see more sophisticated issues involving
cannabis such as proceeds of crime money
[SPEAKER_05]: laundering and probably still the same old
usual suspects of trafficking and
[SPEAKER_05]: possession but the circumstances by which
people will actually go to jail and where
[SPEAKER_05]: families will be torn apart and where
children will be taken from their parents
[SPEAKER_05]: and in ministry cases I'm happy to say
that that's the end of act one and and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's what Clint said and with Nick and
what we're all involved in we're all very
[SPEAKER_05]: fortunate to be part of what's coming act
two legalization it's not perfect but you
[SPEAKER_05]: know it that's why I'm proud to be
Canadian I'm proud to be here I'm proud
[SPEAKER_05]: that we're the first g7 country may not
necessarily be proud about how we're going
[SPEAKER_05]: about it but I'm proud to be here and
proud to be part of this group yeah but
[SPEAKER_03]: there are always you know mistakes made
any time a country does something for the
[SPEAKER_03]: first time and so we know what we're
obviously so proud to be here and to be
[SPEAKER_03]: represented Canada at the same time we
recognize that there are differences the
[SPEAKER_03]: government different approaches the
government could have taken or different
[SPEAKER_03]: tactics the general theme is one of
optimism and and support we just think
[SPEAKER_03]: there are certain things obviously that
can be put over time with the government
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know all the businesses involved
in the space will learn from themselves
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know five ten fifteen years down
the line you know hopefully will have
[SPEAKER_03]: ironed out some of those kinks precisely
and and after talking to government
[SPEAKER_07]: officials for a long time and having them
just say well I can't do anything about
[SPEAKER_07]: your patients sorry it's not legal that
that is the biggest thing when once it
[SPEAKER_07]: becomes a law there's now a process to
change it just like any other law and so
[SPEAKER_07]: while it's not going to be perfect and
it's probably going to be pretty rough for
[SPEAKER_07]: the first couple years there's ways to fix
it and improve it now and so that's we
[SPEAKER_03]: have to we have to recognize that
legalization though it may often be
[SPEAKER_03]: purported as an event in the media is
actually not it's a process and therefore
[SPEAKER_03]: it's iterative and so we see the changes
over time it's an evolution it's not a
[SPEAKER_07]: marathon and we're certainly not done I
mean what we're seeing in Canada is a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of people just kind of went oh well the
federal government's doing it now and
[SPEAKER_07]: forgot about the provinces and how much
power they were going to have for a little
[SPEAKER_07]: while and they forgot about their cities
so there's cities that are saying you know
[SPEAKER_07]: what we don't want to be part of
legalization so there's still a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: work to be done on on every single level
there and we kind of can't be negligent on
[SPEAKER_07]: that and and you know the other area is
that what we've seen in Canada is what
[SPEAKER_07]: we've seen in Washington State and what
we've seen in Colorado the injustice is
[SPEAKER_07]: built into prohibition don't actually go
away with legalization you know actually
[SPEAKER_07]: have to provide incentives to make things
better for those communities that have
[SPEAKER_07]: been paying a higher cost for this all
along I think we're close to very close
[SPEAKER_06]: yes we have maybe five minutes left let's
hear it for the panel one time I was that
[SPEAKER_06]: for no Q&A does anyone have any questions
for them questions over here all the way
[SPEAKER_06]: over there all right I'm coming I tried to
guess that it would they would be on this
[SPEAKER_06]: side but apparently I was close I'm in the
front quadrant but here we go as
[SPEAKER_00]: Hippocrates put it that by food be by
medicine and by medicine be by food
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is most definitely a medicinal
food so governments often control by
[SPEAKER_00]: divide and rule a drug is etymology
etymologically a dried food from the Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: drug so my question is as we all have an
endocannabinoid system surely all cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: use is medicinal direct statement is that
a question so I mean surely is medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: and the argument obviously can be made I
mean insofar as you have an
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system with which all
cannabinoids can interact whether that's
[SPEAKER_03]: phyto or endogenous cannabinoids you have
a central nervous system that interacts
[SPEAKER_03]: with any substance as well I mean the way
I see it more is the use case in the eyes
[SPEAKER_03]: of the consumer so to the extent that I
have friends who purely enjoy the
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational and social properties of
cannabis I would actually label them a
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational consumer not a medical
patient even though it's therapeutic of
[SPEAKER_03]: course of course yeah exactly so the it's
in the eyes in my mind in the eyes of the
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer but you make a good point that
yes we have an endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_03]: which is kind of why the plant is has such
a beautiful harmony with our bodies and I
[SPEAKER_07]: think the whole issue is one of taxation
despite the fact that we've had legal
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis for a long time and the courts
have consistently said you have to provide
[SPEAKER_07]: medical patients with access to cannabis
they've not called it a medicine which is
[SPEAKER_07]: why they've been able to put these taxes
on it so it is kind of a false definition
[SPEAKER_07]: that's born of prohibition we you know
dispensaries and early activists were
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to target those that needed it
desperately not just made people's lives
[SPEAKER_07]: better right and so that's why we've ended
up with this sort of weird definition to
[SPEAKER_05]: answer your question though the reason I
and it's very important thank you for
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing endocannabinoid in the fact that
you know regardless dr. Gabor Matei would
[SPEAKER_05]: would agree I think with with your
conclusion of cannabis being medicine due
[SPEAKER_05]: to the fact we have an endocannabinoid
system and regardless of how it was rec or
[SPEAKER_05]: med regardless but you have to remember
that out of the legal process so again in
[SPEAKER_05]: California which set the stage for a lot
of what's gone on in Canada propositions
[SPEAKER_05]: forget the number but again it was it was
90s was medical and 215 so you have about
[SPEAKER_05]: 45 more seconds Rob good luck with that
I'm just gonna turn over to Jamie nice
[SPEAKER_07]: well yeah we'll all be around you're gonna
get a lot more Canadian panels coming up
[SPEAKER_07]: so our goal was again cut to kind of just
give an overview of what kind of things
[SPEAKER_07]: you can expect where you're gonna get
sudden opposition from senators or from
[SPEAKER_07]: certain towns and things like that so I
hope you guys have a great conference one
[SPEAKER_06]: more time for the panels in for Jamie and
Clint you you
