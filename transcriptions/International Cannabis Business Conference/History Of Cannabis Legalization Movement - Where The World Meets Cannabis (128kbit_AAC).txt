[SPEAKER_02]: In the mid-80s, AIDS epidemic was at full
flight in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: People realized that cannabis had a lot of
medical properties and it was helping
[SPEAKER_02]: people live longer, better lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looked like a hippie, but I wasn't,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to go and you buy your cannabis
and then you go back home and you smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: your cannabis, you know, all by yourself,
full of shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a guy who's actually fairly
successful and he's on microdoses of
[SPEAKER_02]: cocaine almost daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point is just to be chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Handle your drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what you do, no matter how you
show them that cannabis makes money for
[SPEAKER_02]: communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis keeps your communities cleaner
and safer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis provides good jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis provides good training or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a net win.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a safe access.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps people with things they're still
gonna hate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lucky enough that I had a show on
Netflix.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, ICBC family, welcome to Where
the World Meets Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are on the grounds of spandibus right
now, the day before everything pops off.
[SPEAKER_05]: First the ICBC, then spandibus.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're at the Auditorium Cornelia and we
have a very special guest.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're right on stage here with the one and
only, how do you describe this man?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's the MC of the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is prolific, one of the top cannabis
comedians in the world and just an all
[SPEAKER_05]: around great guy, Ungayo Bielam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the show, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, good to see you, dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: How you feeling?
[SPEAKER_05]: Big up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feeling good, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just getting ready for a big week here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, the Barcelona International
Cannabis Business Conference is one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite international cannabis business
conferences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, first of all, every
international cannabis business conference
[SPEAKER_02]: is good and I'm not blowing smoke up your
ass like I do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, me and Barcelona,
we vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get along really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you do love Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that about you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of things about you because
the first time we met was exactly,
[SPEAKER_05]: almost exactly 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeez, Louise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and that was on, I'd like to say we
met on Hate Ashbury, but we met on Lower
[SPEAKER_05]: Hate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lower Hate, like Ralph Fillmore?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Debbie?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was at the Emporium.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you walked in and I was doing some
work there and then you were looking at
[SPEAKER_05]: these books and all of a sudden,
you like, you fucking did the Cabbage
[SPEAKER_05]: Patch and the Bart Simpson in one move,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't just Running Man, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't just Cabbage Patch.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just busted out in a dance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, oh, I was like,
this is my man right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And next thing you know, we were,
we were, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were always in France playing
basketball, freestyling together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basketball, freestyle, and doing events,
too, back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing events.
[SPEAKER_02]: We played the Fillmore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did, we did all those, you helped
produce all those Maritime Hall ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do the Maritime Hall ones.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I did the Hemp Expo, the one in Golden
Gate Park.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, I remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you tell us a little bit,
Ungayo, because really, that was the
[SPEAKER_05]: epicenter of whatever where everything is
at right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really the heart of the cannabis
activism movement the Bay Area was for a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you speak to that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up, you know, I grew up in San
Francisco, born and raised.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right around in the mid-80s,
when the HIV AIDS epidemic was at full
[SPEAKER_02]: flight in San Francisco, people realized
that cannabis had a lot of medical
[SPEAKER_02]: properties and it was helping people live
longer, better lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, people like Dennis Perrone,
people like Brownie Mary, they pushed
[SPEAKER_02]: really hard to make medical cannabis,
at least, even more legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, San Francisco was always somewhat
tolerated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because Brownie Mary would come
into the hospitals, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the cops wanted to bother you,
they could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, when it started to get bigger,
when Brownie Mary would show up at the
[SPEAKER_02]: hospital with pot brownies, when Dennis
Perrone had his den there, he had like an
[SPEAKER_02]: open-air cannabis club, you know,
his belief was always, any form of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, he wasn't very strict about who he let
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Dennis was a character, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the fairy godmother of the medical
cannabis industry, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he has Dennis interest, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a libertarian, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And down with Harvey Milk from all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hardcore libertarian, Dennis Perrone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dennis was, he was a force of nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I learned from those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned from hanging out with Jack
Herrer and Debbie and Don from the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Action Network and stuff,
from American Social Safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Debbie Goldsberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don Duncan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don Duncan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steph Sherer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Conrad, Mickey Norris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris and Mickey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember everybody's name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lynette Shaw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lynette Shaw, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's where, you know, that's where I
got my start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did all the, we produced events.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did cannabis comedy fundraisers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did man, so many things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran West Coast Cannabis Magazine for a
while when we were trying to get Prop 19
[SPEAKER_02]: passed before the other one passed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this whole time, you're doing comedy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're traveling around.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing comedy around America,
around Europe, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess so, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty impressive sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never really think about it because I'm
doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then remember when we did the Cannabis
Cup in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were the emcee of the Cannabis Cup in
like 1999.
[SPEAKER_02]: The High Times Cup in 99.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Fishbone was the headliner.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the Milk Veg.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the Milk Veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Control Machete from Mexico was there,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got into weed activism so I could go see
the bands, really, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you've always been a Fishbone head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hardcore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw them open for the Beastie Boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind getting old because I can say
I saw Fishbone open for the Beastie Boys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've opened for them a couple times.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is old.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is dating yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've opened for, what, with the Slack
mob?
[SPEAKER_02]: The most chill Slack mob.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did open at the Milk Veg when I was the
emcee for the High Times Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you did it all, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're a hardcore activist,
hardcore spokesperson, comedian.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you also had this dope band in the 90s
called the Slack Mob.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did have a band in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: King Slack was your moniker.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one and only King Slack.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, one of my greatest moments,
15 Minutes of Fame, which is only about
[SPEAKER_05]: three minutes, is when you invited me up
at the Fillmore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you were headlining that show.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a 16 and up show.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was almost completely full.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like 900 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were pretty popular for a hot minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did that freestyle with
Psychokinetics and Bazooka Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could go all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that tape.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent that tape to Mark, our DJ,
DJ Ilmeda.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to ask Mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a copy of it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be crazy to listen back to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 29.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, I was six.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very smart and spry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just big for my age.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Black Stewie and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stone six-year-old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six foot six-year-old.
Six foot six-year-old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those were magical times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were living in Europe,
doing your thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to Europe a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there the pre-215.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I worked with Jack and Debbie and
Ed and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's how we really just got down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, I was from
Minneapolis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was from the city.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I came out to Cali.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't know there were black hippies
and shit until I got to California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Black people do everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I knew they did everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just didn't know there were hippies,
I guess, almost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I get to Santa Cruz in like 92.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, I'm dropping into the last
vestige of the summer of love and shit.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I brought to the game was like,
they were just, I look like a hippie,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I wasn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even though I respected the hippies
and respected the hippies, but what I
[SPEAKER_05]: brought to the game was just a little
flavor and a work ethic that wasn't quite.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had that Minnesota work ethic that
appeared in work ethic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in the West Coast, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yet, you were all king slack.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yet, you were getting, I looked up to
you so much because you were getting so
[SPEAKER_05]: much done.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were, I mean, dude, you were the
fucking man in San Francisco.
Oh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about all that, but you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, OK, so here's a story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this represents Ngayo's character.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were playing basketball one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we come back to your brownstone where
you were living in The Mission.
Right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you would pass your car.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a dude in your car.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking, oh, man, it's about to be
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like, oh, hey, Fred.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, so you taught me this,
because I'm from the city.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have compassion, obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you get anesthetized to it when
you just see this shit everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, what the fuck can I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just makes me angry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I see a homeless person,
I get angry at humankind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I didn't know there could be such,
I never thought there was such a pious
[SPEAKER_05]: gesture in my life, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was actually, it changed me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, damn, I got to get with this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the next level of consciousness
right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fred.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Fred, yeah.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you didn't have any place to stay,
so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so you let him stay in your car,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it wasn't no Mercedes either.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was like a green Pontiac.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a four door Pontiac.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody needs help.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we've been doing these shows now in
Europe since 2017.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us a little bit about, tell us why
you like Barcelona so much, because it
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously is a special town for many
different reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Las vibras son fantástico.
[SPEAKER_02]: La gente son muy amable.
[SPEAKER_02]: La comida está muy delicioso y bueno.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y yo hablo español suficientemente para
fumar y comer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like if, you know, I'm a West
Coast kid and I know this is the South of
[SPEAKER_02]: Spain, but it's got a very United States
West Coast vibe in that it's like it's on
[SPEAKER_02]: the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, you know, it's like San
Francisco in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not super expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can do your thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a little job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And still be in a band or still DJ or
still do art and have a nice apartment and
[SPEAKER_02]: kick it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody here is cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never, I haven't met one dickhead in
Barcelona yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's crazy chill, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The search continues.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there is one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a San Diego vibe, a little old
school, like from the 90s and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I disagree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just like looking at the palm
trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, maybe superficially it has a San
Diego vibe, but like the vibe itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: San Diego as the West Coast goes is really
closer to Bakersfield than it is to
[SPEAKER_02]: Portland.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't say like LA, you said Portland.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was the two extremes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with that, but the weather's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: The weed is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: The food is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, everything's easy to walk
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's public transportation is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's up with the coffee shop scene or
the social club scene here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it poppin?
[SPEAKER_05]: For folks who haven't been to Barcelona,
what can they expect?
[SPEAKER_05]: And can anybody just pop up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I will break it down to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: While cannabis is still technically
illegal in Spain, their Supreme court
[SPEAKER_02]: decided a long time ago that you have a
right to put drugs in your body if you
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they have social clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to join a social club and the
social club is allowed to grow weed for
[SPEAKER_02]: you and you have to know somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be sponsored as a member.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just be walking into the social
clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to know somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to know somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to know somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a letter of
recommendation to get in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you're in there,
you can buy cannabis, but you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to take it with you outside of
the club.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nobody ever does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are really like sports bars or some
are like gaming bars and some are like
[SPEAKER_02]: co-working offices and some are just like
little chill nightclubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a lot of different vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find the one you like or there's
generally one in the neighborhood if you
[SPEAKER_02]: can get invited to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I belong to like 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: 10?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you get invited?
[SPEAKER_05]: What type of process is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm lucky enough that I had a show on
Netflix.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I send them an Instagram message and
go, hey, I'd like to come to your club,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like, yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is some tune?
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of my friends will be like,
hey, we're coming to Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get to these clubs?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll send the club a message.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be like, my good friend Eric is coming
into town in April.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would love to be a member.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you had to pick three of your
favorite clubs?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Do?
[SPEAKER_02]: D-O-U.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: La Calada.
[SPEAKER_05]: La Calada?
[SPEAKER_02]: K-A-L-A-D-A.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have great variety, a really good
vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're very active in the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a lot of events and they push a
lot of things for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Acceptance and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third one, that's tough because
there's so many good ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's Gorilla.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Shoko.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's G13.
[SPEAKER_02]: HQ.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Derpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: HQ.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to get to all these spots this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be broke, but I'll be high.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've been to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I lived in Amsterdam for a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: How does the Amsterdam coffee shop scene
compare to the Spain social club scene?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's similar in some ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the different feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Amsterdam coffee shop scene is way
more wide open.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just walk in off the street to
any coffee shop and buy a little something
[SPEAKER_02]: and sit there and consume it and take it
with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's still technically illegal in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't there a five gram tolerated?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a five gram thing or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I never carry more than a few
grams on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they also want you to be way more
discreet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the problems that they're
having in Amsterdam, and the problems that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're kind of having in Barcelona right
now, because I was talking to some people
[SPEAKER_02]: and I said the police have been doing more
inspections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a new mayor who's maybe not
as happy with cannabis clubs as the city
[SPEAKER_02]: used to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Dutch are always trying to kick
the tourists out up in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always trying to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because people show up and they,
especially in Amsterdam, they're kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: drunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they walk into the coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they get stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're crossfaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're amateurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now they're stumbling around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're falling off the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're falling in the canal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're starting fights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, the whole point is just to be chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Handle your drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be an adult.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a great philosophy in
general.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what am I.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Handle your drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be responsible for your own drug use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we all are, really.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Truth be told.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, well, that's the mantra.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't legislate morality.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, I mean, but it's also things
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, I throw cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to keep them no to low alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, it keeps people from getting
crossfaded and puking on my floors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, it's funny to me to watch the boozers
have to sneak off to a corner to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can come over and bust them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys drinking beer?
[SPEAKER_02]: The opposite of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smoking a big joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, hey, hey, no, don't be doing drugs
in here, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Dr. Carl Hart that told me one day,
don't be drug prejudiced.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, don't be drug prejudiced.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought that was so interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: People do drugs, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be, I mean, I'm not,
I don't do a lot of drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a few drugs a lot, like I always like
to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm more understanding of people who
do drugs that I would consider.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just handle it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be an adult.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a guy who's actually fairly
successful, and he's on micro doses of
[SPEAKER_02]: cocaine almost daily.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know people who take heroin who are
successful CEOs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you never know.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, well, I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Carl Hart would say, to invoke Dr.
Carl Hart again, is he said that no matter
[SPEAKER_05]: whether the drugs are legal or not,
there's always going to be a consistent
addiction.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are going to do drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in terms of like doing them
responsibly, there's like maybe 1.5% or
[SPEAKER_05]: something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember the exact number.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will become addicts to whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: To the detriment.
[SPEAKER_05]: To the detriment.
[SPEAKER_05]: To their detriment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just a habitual user, like say a
coffee user or a nicotine smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess you have to define addiction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a habit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to define addiction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess ultimately, or I think we're
all addicted to certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, caffeine is addictive.
[SPEAKER_02]: How fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nicotine is addictive.
For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jogging is addictive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yoga is addictive.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like you say, to the detriment.
[SPEAKER_05]: To the detriment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you doing it responsibly?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you handling your shit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you functional in society?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: High functioning cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, high functioning cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're saying in Amsterdam,
it's more wide open.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more discreet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know you don't really see the
coffee shops off the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the secret doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like maybe a little camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you see their logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the logo of the social club.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so you press the doorbell and a
little door opens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do they serve alcohol in these clubs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Beer, coffee.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some snacks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No hard liquor.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Amsterdam, there was like three types
of coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was that like total local coffee
shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was like the total like tourist
coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there was the hybrids where the
locals and the tourists were there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like remember the roca rye on Lights of
Blue?
[SPEAKER_02]: The roca rye was very popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I went there, I think the last
time I went there was like 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right before everything went crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in Amsterdam a year ago and it
doesn't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least it's not in that place
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I thought that was one of the dopest
ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had, they had, they served
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: But not all coffee shops did serve
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there were some places in
Amsterdam where you could go that were
[SPEAKER_05]: bars that allowed smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you couldn't get the weed there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that should be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you, if you're, I mean,
I think we need more social clubs and
[SPEAKER_02]: more, I mean, a lot of the times in this
push toward legalization, people are
[SPEAKER_02]: really treating alcohol, or not alcohol,
but cannabis, like it's, like it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: shameful dirty drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to go and you buy your
cannabis and then you go back home and you
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke your cannabis, you know,
all by yourself, full of shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: But weed is a social drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: You stand in a circle when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's an equal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's a peer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis clubs, cannabis social clubs,
medical cannabis dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all kinds of social hubs before
legalization in the States, at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the States are like, well,
no, nobody can consume outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to buy it and go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the clubs are coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we need more of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need, you should be able to pop down to
your local, same way you pop down to your
[SPEAKER_02]: local bar and have a drink after work or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should be able to pop down to the
local, have a puff or have some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis cocktail, play some chess with
your homies, watch the game or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then go home.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the one cool thing about
Amsterdam though, is that it is wide open
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can't just have your weed and take
it and smoke it and bring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, as long as you're not a dick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's in general for anything,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think, what do you think,
what do you think the fate of Barcelona's
[SPEAKER_05]: social club scene is?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know enough about the current
politics of Barcelona really to talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but I hope that they would stay and
even be... Grandfathered into some
legal...
[SPEAKER_02]: Even more accepted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for sure, I think it would be great
if... I mean, I really like the smoothness
[SPEAKER_02]: and the discretion of it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we necessarily need to see
giant ads for cannabis clubs everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: People know where to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: The social media will tell you where to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole point is to ask a homie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but where you don't have to... Maybe
it's not so much a private club as it is
[SPEAKER_02]: now, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You become a member, you pay a membership
fee, you become a member of the club in
[SPEAKER_02]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe you could just have some
drop-ins or walk-ins and that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's where... I mean,
it seems like implementation is 90% of the
[SPEAKER_05]: law and so... I mean, it wouldn't be hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're fighting a hundred years of
anti-cannabis propaganda, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're fighting a small percentage of
people who are just gonna... Listen,
[SPEAKER_02]: if common sense and science were gonna win
the day, cannabis would have never have
[SPEAKER_02]: been made illegal, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we have to overcome negative
stereotypes and negative propaganda.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're a percentage of people that
you're not gonna reach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those cats are gonna be the loudest
and they're gonna be the biggest haters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no matter what you do, no matter how
you show them that cannabis makes money
[SPEAKER_02]: for communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis keeps your communities cleaner
and safer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis provides good jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis provides good training or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a net win.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a safe access.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps people with things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still gonna hate it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you have to figure out a way to
work around... I mean, you could work with
[SPEAKER_02]: them up to a point, but they're not really
gonna go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what about social clubs in the state?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any places where you can smoke
weed inside?
[SPEAKER_05]: My house, you just come over.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Colorado, do something where they...
Colorado's just starting some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevada's got a couple.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's New Woo in Las Vegas, which is on
indigenous land.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, their rules are completely different,
but they're opening a whole new...
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a Las Vegas-certified social club in
Vegas right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But isn't that fun?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this is so interesting that I think...
Because Vegas used to be so mean about
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would throw you under for the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, 10 years for a joint or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't out so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like 1975, 1983.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to have signs up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't remember that fear and
loathing picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got all the drugs in the car and one
joint's gonna put them for life or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, let's talk about Berlin for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's another city that you adore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also love Berlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ich liebe Berlin, ja.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working on my... I'm trying to
decide what my German accent is gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm gonna go with a high-pitched
voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, guten Morgen, Fräulein.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wir sind nicht hungrig, ja.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to see you, ja.
[SPEAKER_05]: The stare to Indiana Jones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't tell the Germans I said that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: You won't tell anyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: This won't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: We love Berlin, but here's what I like
about Berlin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's not legal in Berlin,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is... It feels legal because you
can smoke anywhere in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what I think is a big
difference between the American weed
[SPEAKER_05]: culture and... Or culture in European
culture is that they still smoke in
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They still smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone...
[SPEAKER_05]: Even healthy people smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking about tobacco smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tobacco smoke in general, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in some ways... Berlin does not care.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ride your bike everywhere,
you eat healthy, and you smoke a few
[SPEAKER_02]: cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it feels like weed is legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels it's more free even, even though
it's not technically legal, but just the
[SPEAKER_05]: fact that you can smoke it outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in America, we smoke outside too,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And 30 years ago, we'd smoke inside in San
Francisco at the concerts.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just... Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then smoking just got really taboo in
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really funny about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, back in the more
illegal days of cannabis, when we go to
[SPEAKER_02]: throw a cannabis event, you know,
I would tell the person who owned the
[SPEAKER_02]: warehouse or whatever, listen,
there's going to be a lot of pot smoke in
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd be like, yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as there's no cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you go to a thing and you're like,
we're going to throw a cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, that's a great idea,
but you can't smoke in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't smoke inside, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean we can't smoke inside?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can't smoke anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't smoke tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a smoke-free environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, then we can't use your
venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, listen, in their defense,
your venue is going to smell like weed for
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of days after we've left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to tell some people sometimes,
I'm like, we're going to throw a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it cool?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, yeah, man, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, you don't understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it cool?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a serious cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's going to have their own joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a six foot vapor bag
flying around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every table is going to have a bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the room is going to be full.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the windows are going to be open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your block might smell a little bit.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just be ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but isn't that why Europe's cool?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you can just light up outside or
at a cafe in Berlin or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, where I live in Slovenia,
in Ljubljana, extremely cannabis-friendly
[SPEAKER_05]: city.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it legal, technically?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people literally smoke everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: People grow it everywhere in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's got it in the garden next to
the tomatoes and the strawberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the most, I wrote this
article that was slightly unjust,
[SPEAKER_05]: but meant to be poetic and a gonzo style,
saying that Slovenia was the most
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis-friendly nation in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a stretch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I made interesting qualifiers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why, hey, the shit is you feel so safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one's going to bust your balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow pretty good weed, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're all nerdy, smart people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do everything well in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about Slovenia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like Slovenia?
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_05]: You married one, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I fell in love with Slovenia before
I fell in love with the Slovenian girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to become the ambassador to
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, we'll see, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll have me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis ambassador to Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just blessed to be there, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know you like Slovenia, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to be back there in
September?
[SPEAKER_02]: September 13?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we'll be there September 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: Science and technology forum?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, science and technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're taking it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to Lake Bled?
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to Lake Bled.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you tell the people how it
works?
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the Bled again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bled again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the Bled again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bled again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bled again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well fed again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it in.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, it's beautiful out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Balkan Alps or whatever?
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to the Bled again.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we call them, you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not the Urals.
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: Ulyski.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Ulyski.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ulyskalped.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ulyskalped.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I can speak Slovenian,
but somehow I can't get that right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot all my Slovenian the minute we
left.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was there for three days,
and it was starting to come around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, you know, it's such an easy
language to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to listen.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you do your thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, I speak many different
languages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, people always want to sell me
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, in Slovenia, I catch 30% of the
words, but I catch 80% of the vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the important thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Lake Bled's dope, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Lake Bled is beautiful, and you can walk
around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people parasail and boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Switzerland, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it is very, very, very alpine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's the Alps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the other side of the Alps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very alpine, very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: The air is fresh and clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: The food was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ljubljana was cool, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we went over to Pop's Pizza.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a suburb that thinks it's a
city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's a city that acts like a suburb.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call it a village.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's the smallest capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, it's got the big city vibe,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a few giant buildings and some
old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit, it has a big city vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: City halls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a tiny little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit of a big city vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It understands that it's the capital city.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely understands that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smaller.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's very quaint.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quaint.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good word for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's super chill.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might not be quite your speed of
Barcelona and Berlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not New York or Berlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I could live there in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be there in the summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could winter in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could spring in summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't ski a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So tell us, what are you doing now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides ICBC, what's Ungai Obelum up to?
[SPEAKER_05]: You got any TV shows coming up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on some things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody wants to be the travelogue guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm working on my little travelogue TV
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm chopping up with the cats at connected
.tv on some things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be hosting the Arizona
Growers Cup and the Growers Cup Series.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just did the Missouri Growers Cup,
doing the Arizona Growers Cup,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think we're bringing one to New York
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow me on all the Instagrams and
whatnot, NGAIO420 to get the latest news.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing some comedy shows, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Writing for High Times and Leafly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The usual stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prolific.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pro, pro, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always think I'm not doing enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I look back six months later,
I'm like, hey, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slow down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a day off.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as you're getting paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, what a concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should talk to somebody about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fortunate enough to get paid for stuff
I do for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the people who pay me know I do it for
free.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they take advantage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like you'd fit in just fine in
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, dude, thanks so much, bro,
for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was so fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have time for too long.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we're very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we go, bro, thank you, dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: The International Campus Business
Conference is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not just kissing your ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know I would tell you if it
sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be the first in line to be like,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to get our shit together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a good time, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've come a long way from Medford,
Oregon.
Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always just impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you first said Berlin,
me and everybody, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a month before it, Berlin was
like, we're starting a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, Alex, you're a genius.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever you caught with the zeitgeist
or your little connection to the universe,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, keep that shit up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fire, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I appreciate you being there with me
on the journey, dog.
Respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All that.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the world meet cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks in Gaobilim.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see you next time.
