[SPEAKER_00]: We travel up here from Texas for the
education, for the networking,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a part of a community that's very
special and dear to our hearts but we do
[SPEAKER_00]: take all this knowledge back to Texas and
try to spread as much of it as we can,
[SPEAKER_00]: sprinkle it in throughout our retail
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vancouver is definitely one for the books.
[SPEAKER_03]: ICBC is a way for those of us in the
industry to understand what is
[SPEAKER_03]: state-of-the-art in thinking, in doing,
in regulation and in CPG.
[SPEAKER_03]: ICBC has been very very helpful to those
of us in the industry with putting on the
[SPEAKER_03]: conferences, putting us on stage,
exchanging information and understanding
[SPEAKER_03]: where we are at this very moment in time
and it is a great luxury and a great
[SPEAKER_03]: pleasure to be here at ICBC in Vancouver
today.
