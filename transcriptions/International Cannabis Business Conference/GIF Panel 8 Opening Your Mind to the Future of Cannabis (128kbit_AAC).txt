[SPEAKER_03]: How to open your mind to the future of
cannabis, the founder of MJ Universe,
[SPEAKER_03]: Lisa Haag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everybody for the warm welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to set some expectation, this is just
some light entertainment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to talk about some different
angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that need to be talked about more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all decide on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, my name is Lisa Haag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the CEO and founder of MJ Universe
GmbH.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a consulting company.
[SPEAKER_01]: My consulting focus is mainly on
commercial strategy and marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started in the cannabis industry in
2016, but I'm also part of the board of
[SPEAKER_01]: the German industry representation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a bachelor in business and a German
economics degree and I'm an entrepreneur
[SPEAKER_01]: in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, before we get started and dive in,
I have an open question to you in the
[SPEAKER_01]: audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think would be if cannabis was
something that was brand new or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: never even illegal?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there are some brave takers and for
some answers, what do you think where we
[SPEAKER_01]: would stand with the cannabis industry if
it was something that was just discovered?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any takers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there would be more clinical
studies that have been done and so there'd
[SPEAKER_00]: be a lot more research because people
would be interested to see how this would
[SPEAKER_00]: affect us or how it could help people as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great answer already.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would be a world sensation if
cannabis was never illegal or something
[SPEAKER_01]: that was brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the special situation with
cannabis that there is a huge research
[SPEAKER_01]: gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we compare it, for example,
to psychedelics, there has been continuous
[SPEAKER_01]: research with psychedelics, but with
cannabis, it's a special situation that no
[SPEAKER_01]: research has been taking place for over 20
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's something that we have to catch
up now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you may be new to the company,
to the cannabis industry, but others,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are more experienced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the thing is, we don't see in the
cannabis a continuous growth curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you perceive it,
but to me, sometimes it feels like a wild
[SPEAKER_01]: ride where it goes up and down and curves
and back and front.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's a question, are you just sitting
in that vehicle being driven around or are
[SPEAKER_01]: you playing a more active role?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you leading the discussion or do you
lead through actions?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that is very important
to say many people that are leading the
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion are not doing the groundwork
and the people who are doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: groundwork are not talking enough about
what the great things are that they are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think that it's all of our
responsibility to do and make cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: future proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what waterproof is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water doesn't get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is to make cannabis future proof is
to design or develop it in a way that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can ensure it's a long-term relevance and
adaptability to changing services and
[SPEAKER_01]: circumstances, technologies and trends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a lot of purpose with what is
happening in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are motivated through
purpose and can provide some value,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we also see that a lot of value is
missed and destroyed or not even possible
[SPEAKER_01]: to be captured because also of the biggest
trade barrier that we have in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry through the global drug policy
and by cannabis being in the status of a
[SPEAKER_01]: narcotic on a global level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's go a little bit into hype,
trend and megatrend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hype is something that is short-lived and
promotional and something that goes away
[SPEAKER_01]: after a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe CBD was one of these hypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A trend that we can see is something that
is developing more in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: A global megatrend is something that is
changing the dynamics of our world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally believe that cannabis fits
into many of the global megatrends that
[SPEAKER_01]: are active today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take individualization, like that you have
individual medicine that is something for
[SPEAKER_01]: you in the gender shift discussion,
making cannabis more accessible for women,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: In silver society where we have a more
aging society where cannabis becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowledge culture is something about
learning from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new work is also something that is
impacted more through the dynamics of
[SPEAKER_01]: COVID also, but we are collaborating on a
global level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have companies working together from
Canada with German companies all on a
[SPEAKER_01]: remote scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something that is very innovative
and that is very new.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this topic of health where I'll go
into depth a little bit more in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: A topic of new ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to shape our future.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The topic of connectivity, how we are all
connected with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: The topic of globalization, but also
acting on a global level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mobility has changed and security needs
are changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the topics that we should
maybe talk a little bit more about in that
[SPEAKER_01]: context is, for example, innovation and
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: The role of innovation and technology and
how it's shaping the future of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: including advancement in cultivation
techniques, extraction methods,
[SPEAKER_01]: product development, but also on a highly
technological level.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at, for example, new materials
or textiles and those kind of situations,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to talk more about regulatory
challenges and opportunities, the evolving
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory landscape surrounding cannabis,
exploring the challenges faced by the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and potential for policy changes
that could unlock further growth and
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also need to talk more about social
and cultural integration, also exploring
[SPEAKER_01]: how we can really integrate cannabis into
a mainstream society and how it is
[SPEAKER_01]: impacting also various cultural domains
such as art, music, wellness,
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure, and social gathering.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the biggest mega trends is the new
ecology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humans are looking to reintegrate into the
ecosystem earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes more not an economy-based
system, but a value-based system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something that is changing also
through future generations that may be not
[SPEAKER_01]: here yet, but still in high school,
and that they want to create a more
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something where cannabis can play a
very essential and critical role.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to get beyond the stigma that
is in the people's head.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a big THC thinking barrier in the
people's heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to talk and shift cultural
attitudes, change perceptions and
[SPEAKER_01]: attitudes towards cannabis, highlighting
the growing acceptance of legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And legalization also means removing the
trade barrier for medicinal cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: for industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical potential, exploring the
expanding medical applications of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: on an API basis on delivery systems and
all those kind of things that are things
[SPEAKER_01]: that take us beyond the THC thinking
barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also about the economic impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Analyze the economic benefits of the
cannabis industry, including job creation,
[SPEAKER_01]: tax revenue generation, opportunities for
entrepreneurship and investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need to get beyond this barrier
that is in our minds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also something that I personally feel
there is a big lack in is the discussion
[SPEAKER_01]: about social justice and equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been a war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to make up for the damages that
have been caused by the war on drugs and
[SPEAKER_01]: address the importance of the historical
injustice related to cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also Advocate to give something back
through all these things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: happening that are creating revenue,
that are creating prosperity, that you
[SPEAKER_01]: give something back to the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a strong cannabis industry
plant that has strong roots and that can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow high and become a big and prosperous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe also open the perspectives of
people to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at how cannabis is perceived
here in Germany for the medical part,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's basically your last resort.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're very sick, you may have access,
but that's the wrong approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you look at the definition of the
World Health Organization, health is a
[SPEAKER_01]: state of complete physical, mental,
and social well-being and not merely the
[SPEAKER_01]: absence of disease or infirmity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This area of the health aspect we are not
even covering and we are not touching,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's the potential there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we see the muscle of hierarchy of
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the lower aspects like the
safety, social, and belonging self-esteem.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like basic human needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we can see that there is this
trend for self-actualization.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I do for myself?
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the level beyond that,
and that's where I see many cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneurs are motivated, is
self-truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I do for others?
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially now we had this discussion
a lot here with the commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not necessarily the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may be just a commodity that belongs
into different industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this raw material aspect,
the pharmaceutical ingredient aspect,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fast-moving consumer goods,
lifestyle products, and all these that
[SPEAKER_01]: come out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we still have the situation that every
marketer within us needs to stick to their
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing segment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there are some big issues arising
through that and there are some big issues
[SPEAKER_01]: globally that we can talk about and we
should discuss so we can really educate on
[SPEAKER_01]: these issues like, for example,
with the CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a lifestyle product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it helping to cure whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just a cosmetics ingredient where
you can't really say anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are challenges that marketers
have in Germany, but also have in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: have in America, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only constant in life is change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's very important that all of
us are working towards change,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we are lobbying towards
reclassification of cannabis or even
[SPEAKER_01]: having it removed from the single
convention, because at least in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion, it's still highly limited through
that and many things have not had progress
[SPEAKER_01]: at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, cannabis resin and flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Germany, for example, this affects us
with the CBD flour where it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still have rates with the CBD shops
because flour is not allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many things that you as
marketers can do to accelerate this
[SPEAKER_01]: change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is maybe about your product features.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have exceptional service.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have a very great quality output
or an exceptional skill or very detailed
[SPEAKER_01]: information and all those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most important thing that
should go on top of that is lobby work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each and every one of us need to be there,
need to educate regulators, need to
[SPEAKER_01]: educate just also potential industry
stakeholders that are interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: entering this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what is lacking a lot is to make
an educated decision on these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have a lot of wrong information in
their heads, so they cannot really make an
[SPEAKER_01]: educated decision, and the educated
decision should not only be to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: better understanding of consumption of
recreational cannabis, but also maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: reconsidering hemp regulations and see
what barriers are there that are necessary
[SPEAKER_01]: and that could potentially be removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that I personally care about
is I do a lot of corporate consulting,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're here at an investment
conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will hear it a lot, unicorn,
unicorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no such thing as unicorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those in most cases do not exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they appear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I personally would love to see more
zebras in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zebra is a company that focuses on
sustainable prosperity, community,
[SPEAKER_01]: quality, collaboration of a company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this industry should be more
about long-term perspective than
[SPEAKER_01]: short-term gains, and I really think it's
great that we all come here together to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk and compare and contrast the
different approaches to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization and regulation in different
countries, but also jointly identify
[SPEAKER_01]: global trends and potential collaborations
for research and industry growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put an X because it's what can I do,
what can you do to bring this change?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can finally be a global cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, the most important thing is
education, advocacy, and thought
[SPEAKER_01]: leadership.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is in each and every one's
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that sense, thank you for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lisa Hogg, one more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: How is everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you enjoy the snacks?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you get a coffee?
[SPEAKER_03]: How was the strudel?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the only one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I actually didn't have the strudel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the apple pastry, a little buttery,
sugary.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I eat so good here in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're too fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're very excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone have any questions for Lisa?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else you want to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Francesca, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, I'm Francesca.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you touched a very important point
of view about the well-being of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I never heard about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never heard about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not from many people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you be your point of view about
that if talking about prevention
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective when talking about well-being
in cannabis perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be your perspective and
potential?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be your idea of going in that
direction and cooperation or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have this high barrier with the
narcotic, which is, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest trade barrier that should be
removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to see how this will affect us
in Germany and patient access in Germany
[SPEAKER_01]: also.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that also a lot of the
products, they are not in their proper
[SPEAKER_01]: standard of identity yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take the CBD products here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of lifestyle CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are sold and marketed as medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entrepreneurs have a lot of issues
because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The authorities come.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, where is your medicinal
authorization to sell it as a medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't make health claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been some very negative court
rulings in that regard also.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, there are no proper
products available through pharmacies,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, for CBD that are with a full
spectrum extract because we have only
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate that can be prescribed and we have
the narcotics prescription cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products, which also includes everything
with high CBD, low THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this OTC, there's a big gap and
companies would need to go in there to
[SPEAKER_01]: also reap this potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, another aspect of that is to really
create awareness for that, that it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: only the last resort through education,
for example, that cannabis can be used
[SPEAKER_01]: also as a tool maybe to prevent illnesses
or to just take hemp seed oil could also
[SPEAKER_01]: be something to prevent, to sustain a good
health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a matter of awareness about that and
building new perspective around that theme
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
All right, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lisa, hug.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will start moving on.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, our next panel, the opportunity of
cannabis and science.
Thank you.
