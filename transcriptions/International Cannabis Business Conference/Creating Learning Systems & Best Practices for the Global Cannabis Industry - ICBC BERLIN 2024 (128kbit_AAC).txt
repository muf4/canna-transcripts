[SPEAKER_07]: She's the founder of the MJ universe.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's amazing all over the world and
especially in Germany.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for Lisa Hogg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody and welcome to this panel
on creating learning system and processes
[SPEAKER_04]: for the global cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have a warm welcome for our
panelists.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today we have on this panel Deepak Anand
and you potentially know him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been in the cannabis industry for 40
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been in the cannabis industry for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a principal at ASD consultancy
service as business strategy company
[SPEAKER_04]: focused on consulting businesses in
alcohol, tobacco, pharmaceutical,
[SPEAKER_04]: CPG industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deepak's experience spans in a decade of
cannabis industry including as an operator
[SPEAKER_04]: and advisor to companies in North America,
Europe, Africa and Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: He also actively contributes to patient
advocacy and as a vice chair at Medical
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis Canada and is also involved in
the advancement of a global standard
[SPEAKER_04]: within the cannabis sector as a member of
the ASTM.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an association that's working with
global standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'm pleased to have Dr. Shornav Reg
here on my panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's the head of research and toxicology
at True Turpines.
[SPEAKER_04]: She received a PhD studying chemistry of
vaping and developing a toxicology program
[SPEAKER_04]: to review all the ingredients used in true
turbine products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally, she's actively contributes
to the advancement of global standards
[SPEAKER_04]: also with ASTM.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I also have here on the panel John
Slaughter, CEO and founder of North High.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since 2016, High North has worked with
over 900 cannabis companies around the
[SPEAKER_04]: world and performed over 460,000 tests on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the past three years, High North has
been recognized as the analytical
[SPEAKER_04]: laboratory of the year in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Round of applause for the panelists.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we dive into this, let's have a
little bit of a look into what a learning
[SPEAKER_04]: system is.
[SPEAKER_04]: A learning system is a system that allows
you to create, manage, organize and
[SPEAKER_04]: deliver knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we all know, education and educating on
the cannabis plant is one of the key
[SPEAKER_04]: factors of success for our industry and
also maybe just as a good example for a
[SPEAKER_04]: learning system is the ICBC itself because
it's a place where people can actively
[SPEAKER_04]: engage and cultivate their knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very excited for our panel today.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first question after that goes to
Deepak.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deepak, can you go a little bit maybe
explain to the audience what kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: learning systems currently exist in the
cannabis industry, what is missing and why
[SPEAKER_04]: are learning systems so important to
accelerate sustainable growth?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me and thanks for
putting this together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that just a step back,
I think education and learning is so
[SPEAKER_03]: important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think as countries start to legislate
and legalize cannabis both for medical and
[SPEAKER_03]: non-medical purposes, I think it's really,
really important to have knowledge sharing
[SPEAKER_03]: and information and education.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a lot of education, there's a lot
of people that need to be educated,
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone from regulators to stakeholders
to shareholders to doctors, to literally
[SPEAKER_03]: every single part of the value chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: What exists now?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot that's happening across the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think often when you stay in Europe,
you forget that there's a number of
[SPEAKER_03]: countries, Canada, the US that have gone
down the path of legalization and have a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of experience in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot that is actually available
in terms of educational content.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a number of programs on a variety
of different sections of the value chain,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it be cultivation, extraction,
testing, processing, there's a lot that's
[SPEAKER_03]: available.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really depends on which market you're
focusing on and it's not a one size fits
[SPEAKER_03]: all solution, but there is quite a bit
that exists.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the perfect system is really
blending what exists with what's different
[SPEAKER_03]: about a market that you might be in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move over to Shawna.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shawna, one of the things that people
often mix up are standards and
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you maybe explain a little bit what
the difference is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you also maybe comment if you think,
is there a global cannabis standard or is
[SPEAKER_04]: it just a set of interpretations of
regulations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very often times when we're talking about
standards, a lot of the partners or other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry members are concerned
that these standards are going to become
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations and they're very confused on
what the difference is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A standard is just a way of doing
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times they can be bare minimum
requirements and sometimes they can be
[SPEAKER_01]: more than that, but a lot of times they're
very voluntary.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times they're things that you're
already doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just directing you to do it a certain
way over another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: A great example is there's a standard for
the shape that a stop sign should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not specifically written into a
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every stop sign has to be a hexagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be this shade of red.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's written into a standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: A city is already creating stop signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine as well create a stop sign that's the
same as the city next to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the same as the state or country
that borders them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how standards are implemented.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just cohesion across different
locations so everyone can understand it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see a lot of defragmented rules for
that or is it one harmonious standard that
[SPEAKER_04]: you also see develop over time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you maybe talk also about the segments
a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think right now it's very disjointed
because cannabis is a very new industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't been around for very long as a
regulated industry, where if you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: other industries like ceramics or
construction, they have standards that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone follows, but they've been around
for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does take time for these cohesive
standards to get created.
[SPEAKER_01]: A great platform that is creating them is
ASTM, which Deepak and I are both a part
[SPEAKER_01]: of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone can become a member of ASTM.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a very low cost of entry,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the members contribute to standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to get buy-in from consumers and
from industry manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even regulators that join.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very valuable platform to get
cohesive buy-in so that we will all be
[SPEAKER_01]: following the same standards in the
future.
[SPEAKER_04]: But four different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's all broken down into different
areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: John, where do you see the testing
standards moving globally?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which countries have good testing
standards, which do not or may need some
[SPEAKER_04]: improvement?
[SPEAKER_04]: For which segments of the cannabis
industry do you think standards are most
[SPEAKER_04]: important to be set?
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, thank you for inviting us
from Canada here to be able to speak to
[SPEAKER_02]: the European market.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we look at it, Deepak talked about it
right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go and get a license right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You now have a German medicinal license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your cannabis is probably coming from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was probably tested through to High
North, and I probably have the COA.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing these standards as they go
around the world and change.
[SPEAKER_02]: For us in Canada, we have 17 pharmacopias
we test to.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because all the countries around
the world, in fact, aren't going together.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually drifting apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look at the difference between
sending something to Israel or something
[SPEAKER_02]: to Australia, the difference in not only
the pharmacopia, but the testing needed
[SPEAKER_02]: are drastically further apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me in Canada, it's fine because I can
be this Swiss Army knife that can be
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you need it to be and export to
every country.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really don't think the regulators
have really thought about and taken a step
[SPEAKER_02]: back to say, I want to make really strict
guidelines for cannabis for this country.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, great, but now not one lab in
your entire country can actually test to
[SPEAKER_02]: those standards without millions of
dollars of investment during a time in
[SPEAKER_02]: which it's in its infancy and nobody's
going to want to do that investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've almost hamstrung every single one
of these cultivators that's trying to get
[SPEAKER_02]: this two million square foot operation off
the ground using a lab that they can
[SPEAKER_02]: barely get access to, that they're getting
data back from, that they question every
[SPEAKER_02]: time, that's often 25, 30 days later than
they need to be getting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those regulations seem smart off the bat,
but just adding something like bromide to
[SPEAKER_02]: your pesticide testing, that just caused a
$1.5 million investment to whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory now has to test that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because you're doing a second run,
you're using another LCMS, your most
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive machine is now being run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you think about how important a
laboratory is, especially in those early
[SPEAKER_02]: days, that's your dashboard of your car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every morning you get in your car,
the speedometer, as people know in Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: it might say it's 80, you're actually
driving 62.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need to think about that
calculation because my lab's always giving
[SPEAKER_02]: me back THC scores that are higher and
higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like coming in and every single one
of the lights being on in your car and you
[SPEAKER_02]: just ignoring those lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, those lights could be hot blatant
virus spreading across your entire
[SPEAKER_02]: facility, but if the lab is giving you
back results saying it's clean,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's clean and there you go, you press on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not having that data, I think it not only,
it seems like a good idea, it seems like
[SPEAKER_02]: you've added good standards, but what
you've really done is you've limited the
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratories and literally blinded the
growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's just you're set up to
cause the longest curve to be able to get
[SPEAKER_02]: up and actually get functional in that
market, not happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plain and simple not happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you wanna talk about where this
goes bad, it's the legacy market taking
[SPEAKER_02]: over.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's products coming in that are 100%
untested because the only ones that are
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting people's hands that are actually
being smoked are not from your legal
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you feel like you've added good
standards, but what you've really done,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've lagged the legal clean industry and
you've given a jumpstart to the backside
[SPEAKER_02]: of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The worst example is the Netherlands,
love to dunk on them for this because go
[SPEAKER_02]: into any place in there, any coffee shop,
you feel like what you're getting is good
[SPEAKER_02]: weed, whatever, it might be good weed,
it's not tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's plain and simply not tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every single place you go to,
none of that stuff is tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: So great place to go for vacation,
smoke some weed, but your pesticides could
[SPEAKER_02]: be off, there could be heavy metals,
there could be aflatoxins, you have no
[SPEAKER_02]: idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a requirement for the new
cannabis that is provided through the
[SPEAKER_04]: pilot programs that they do testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I agree with their cannabis that is
from illicit sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is right now, if you look at
past what, 20, 30 years have you been
[SPEAKER_02]: going to a coffee shop in Amsterdam,
you're smoking 100% untested cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're talking about also different
areas where standards and testing
[SPEAKER_04]: standards become relevant for cultivation,
for manufacturing, for all those kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that they have been discussed in
global medicinal cannabis standards in the
[SPEAKER_04]: International Narcotic Control Board in
2021, but I have not personally seen a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of development.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Shauna, who is really developing the
global cannabis standards?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we as an industry developing those?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are the regulators, who are the people
really developing the cannabis standard?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people that are currently
developing standards have been the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are global standard groups like ASTM
that I mentioned, but those standards take
[SPEAKER_01]: time because it's such a thorough process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they take time to come to place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I think regulators are the best people
to create standards?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes we see regulators don't have a
lot of knowledge on the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: nor do they have any firsthand experience
in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we're going to see a lot of
regulators are riding laws that are
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes different than what has already
been placed in other countries or other
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think, oh, we can do it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They saw pitfalls here and they're like,
let me try it differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think what we might see in the future
is regulators try what they think is best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They realize it takes time for them to
admit that maybe I don't know what's best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll direct to these global
standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: ASTM is one, but I know there's other
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if Deepak if you know of
other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think from a European perspective,
it's important to understand so far
[SPEAKER_03]: there's been no single monograph even on
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been a long time coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know now there's a lot of work that's
going into creating a monograph just on
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there certainly seems to be more
harmonization occurring.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the whole fundamental of
the European Union generally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's unfortunate that we still see very
much a country by country approach within
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the biggest challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you're a cultivator in Canada
or Portugal or anywhere, and you're trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to service Denmark, Poland, Germany,
and the UK, you have four completely
[SPEAKER_03]: different set of regulations that you need
to follow just because there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: harmonization of regulations or even a
monograph.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think having a monograph,
which now there's a lot of work happening
[SPEAKER_03]: at the European Union level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, hopefully, we'll see a
monograph on flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those sorts of things actually need to
happen, because it creates a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure on the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, look at Denmark.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's supplying to Denmark really now,
because at one time, there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: hype.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, if you understand the Danish
regulations, you actually need to reverse
[SPEAKER_03]: engineer your cultivation room to be able
to exclude certain pesticides,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, to be able to sell in that
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a real requirement for
harmonization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, in the EU, I do agree with
Shana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulators aren't necessarily the best
placed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately, in the EU, the way
things work is it is regulator driven.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of companies now that
are giving feedback to the European Union
[SPEAKER_03]: on flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think more of that actually needs to
happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next question would have been also in
that regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my background in facility
management.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it's every light switch has a
code, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everything is standardized.
[SPEAKER_04]: So coming into the cannabis industry,
I saw that there are not many standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, also from your experience as
an entrepreneur, do you also see that
[SPEAKER_04]: these pharmacological, regular standard
systems, like too many, they're a book of
[SPEAKER_04]: seven seals that have to be learned?
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes don't make sense,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, you look at Switzerland,
this whole organic requirement on cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are certain things from a regulatory
perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: It isn't clear what the regulators were
thinking when they were going to start to
[SPEAKER_03]: launch these products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oftentimes, they're self-serving.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is definitely part of the
challenge is that regulations sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: are shaped in a way that aren't
necessarily fostering to cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because yes, it's a pharmaceutical product
in some instances.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not exactly the same as tobacco
or the same as pharma.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a unique kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it needs a unique set of regulations
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the things.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the testing side, you see that all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could grab any one of the tests,
heavy metals, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, use a pharmacopoeia for your
heavy metals and justify it.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, there are 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: So am I going to go the high side,
the low side?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many grams per day am I doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I using tea as my analogy and saying,
well, it's like tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how many grams of tea am I having in
a day equivalent to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, what would that be for my heavy
metals?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then as you take that and go to export,
the broker might say, no, actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want 1 tenth that because I'm taking
that 10 grams instead of one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the lack of nailing down these
things that TPAC was getting into,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've literally put it back into the
industry as a question that the broker
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially has to handle because they're
the one that has to get it into the
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll go back to the health care
person and go like, so is it this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it that?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, yeah, guess what, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're testing zinc now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it needs to be over this level.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, OK, well, I guess we're testing
zinc now, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is so fluid right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not really that fluid is going in
absolutely all directions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's interesting that you say that
because we have that discussion here a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: for the clubs in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to be food standard?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to be a pharma grade standard
or agricultural standard that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: sticking?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or will we have our own solution?
[SPEAKER_04]: How important are analytical testing
standards, especially for the start of the
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization?
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe what are some lessons learned
that we can take here when lobbying for
[SPEAKER_04]: those causes?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is important and what criteria should
be used?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think to build on that point there of
pharmaceutical, cannabis is a living
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have micros on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you try to go no microbials,
no nothing on top of this, this thing's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be a dead plant, you're leading
down to radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've done that, you've now created a
whole other industry of irradiation that
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to be coming up out of this wherever
you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's whatever country you're in,
you now not only need labs to be putting
[SPEAKER_02]: in massive money to be investing into more
testing standards, but now all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_02]: you're adding irradiation facilities all
the way across your place so that you
[SPEAKER_02]: could be close to an irradiation facility
to get it down to zero microbes so you can
[SPEAKER_02]: get it out the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these things just plain and simply
don't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's because we have to go
back to a pharmacopoeia that makes sense
[SPEAKER_02]: to us, but inside of that you're like 98%
of that pharmacopoeia makes sense,
[SPEAKER_02]: but 2% doesn't, but that's the best one I
can go with right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until there really is one that matches
cannabis, you are setting people up to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow in completely different standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one of the things that I worry
about when I hear a top Canadian grower
[SPEAKER_02]: has just moved over to wherever new
country of whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: To some of them it's like you've taken an
F1 racer that was in an F1 car and you
[SPEAKER_02]: just dropped him into a Lada with all the
gauges flashing and you're saying be an F1
[SPEAKER_02]: racer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like buddy, like I don't even,
the gauges aren't working, like the track
[SPEAKER_02]: looks different, like how do you expect me
to be the F1 racer that I want me to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that definition really does,
it sets the cannabis facilities,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially the growers, up for failure day
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely day one.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can just add one more piece to what
John said, I think you know you look at
[SPEAKER_03]: irradiation even as one example,
you know in Europe you need to comply with
[SPEAKER_03]: safety for inhalation, which is typically
on the monograph 5.1.4, and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: different ways to reach that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in Germany for example, if you're
trying to sell a product with that
[SPEAKER_03]: compliance, you need to irradiate and then
you need to be able to get something
[SPEAKER_03]: called an Amrad 5 or an Amrad 5 license,
and that takes anywhere from nine to 12
[SPEAKER_03]: months to be able to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now people are actually trying to see
ways to get around that process,
[SPEAKER_03]: and some people are using steam,
some people are using a variety of
[SPEAKER_03]: different things, and it leads to
non-compliance in some cases, and actually
[SPEAKER_03]: fooling the regulator in some cases,
so really you're not creating best
[SPEAKER_03]: standards for the industry, because people
are just trying to figure out how to get
[SPEAKER_03]: around 5.1.4.
[SPEAKER_04]: And best practices, but best work around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that exactly, you literally nailed on
that inhalation one, it's a perfect one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you could create a cannabis
operation that could work under this
[SPEAKER_02]: legally, great, you're under it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's gonna want that product around the
rest of the country?
[SPEAKER_02]: So great, you've created something that
only your local market's gonna wanna
[SPEAKER_02]: consume, and it's never gonna be exported
to every country, because you're gonna go
[SPEAKER_02]: to other countries and you're gonna get
PPE'd against people that aren't using
[SPEAKER_02]: inhalation as their monograph,
which means that the product's not gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: be irradiated, which means it's gonna get
to you faster, it's going to be fresher,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not gonna be as dried out,
like there's a lot of little things,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if you said my radiation barely even
degrades my product, it's still added six
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks to everything, and six week old weed
is still six week old weed, and it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: like it was handled well during that
process, it's going to be a degraded
[SPEAKER_02]: product on the global market versus other
people that don't have to sit under that
[SPEAKER_02]: standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you're setting your country up to
fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and what they're talking about is
essentially unintended consequences,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulators come in, they say something,
and they don't have an understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: the big picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like John mentioned, adding bromide to
it, or maybe lowering an action limit of
[SPEAKER_01]: something, and they don't understand that
that means now the lab has to redo their
[SPEAKER_01]: whole analytical methods, maybe they need
to get new analytical instruments,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they're farther and farther
behind from providing compliant products
[SPEAKER_01]: to consumers, and the whole idea behind
best practices and learning systems should
[SPEAKER_01]: be to allow consumers to participate in
the regulated marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be the goal, and oftentimes
they don't match that goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Shawna, you are also working with
terpenes a lot in the German Pharmacopec
[SPEAKER_04]: and cannabis is basically THC and CBD,
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should terpenes and other cannabinoid
contents also play a more vital role in
[SPEAKER_04]: this, or would they limit us?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say terpenes and other
cannabinoids, they play a role in the
[SPEAKER_01]: product and consumers' choices and
consumer experience of the product,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I wouldn't want to see regulators come
in and try to regulate based on those
[SPEAKER_01]: materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of compounds in there,
and regulators will more often than not
[SPEAKER_01]: get things wrong, but what I'd love to see
is for manufacturers to take a voluntary
[SPEAKER_01]: approach and do terpene analysis and maybe
list the top three or the top five
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes on the product packaging,
and that just allows the consumers to have
[SPEAKER_01]: more information and to make a choice that
fits better with what experience they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deepak, what are some other lessons
learned for, especially in that regard?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I would take this back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think often regulators are looking at
THC and CBD because it's the big thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but not looking at what consumers actually
want, and if you look at what consumers
[SPEAKER_03]: want, the trend is towards CBG and CBN and
THCV and a variety of other new
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids, and so consumers are always
going to get that, whether it be from the
[SPEAKER_03]: legacy or the legal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's very important when framing
cannabis regulations to understand that
[SPEAKER_03]: this is very much a process and not an
event, so you as a regulator need to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: on top of what's happening in the industry
and be able to go through that process and
[SPEAKER_03]: improve and be able to add other
cannabinoids, so I don't necessarily think
[SPEAKER_03]: regulating them to the same level is
necessarily the best thing because there's
[SPEAKER_03]: different risks with different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see workarounds in HHC,
which is a really hot topic in Europe now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me started.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to keep on top of consumer trends
and be able to give consumers what they
[SPEAKER_03]: want because otherwise they're just going
to get it somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a perfect example of a workaround.
[SPEAKER_02]: HHC and all the rest of these things,
you have forced people to play with wacky
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry to be able to get to something
that delivers the same in the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inside of that process, you have
introduced new chemicals that are not
[SPEAKER_02]: being tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're flying through the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me that that HHC product,
if it was truly created at HHC,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to have additional analytes
inside of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've just essentially added something to
a very natural and gorgeous product,
[SPEAKER_02]: so no.
[SPEAKER_02]: No circumstance, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Preach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe as a last question before we open
the floor for the audience is to all of
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can we as the industry enable more
learning systems and how can we actively
[SPEAKER_04]: engage in the development of standards and
why should we be motivated, as they called
[SPEAKER_04]: us, to actively engage?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe start with you, Shona.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the first step of creating
learning systems is to share your
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this is a for-profit industry,
and so you want to keep your secret sauce
[SPEAKER_01]: to yourself, but the only way to educate
regulators or create these learning
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, educate consumers, et cetera,
is to share the information that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have been working with cannabis for
decades before the regulated market came
[SPEAKER_01]: to play, and so there's knowledge that
needs to be shared and accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of information is hidden behind
paywalls, unfortunately, so I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: would be great if people created a
database that had these PDFs to these
[SPEAKER_01]: papers that are typically hidden behind
paywalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be accessible to everyone, that would
be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many scientists also hand out the papers
if you contact them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually they give you the paper.
That is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've direct emailed professors and said,
hey, can you send me your paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost every single time they do,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deepak, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: How can we create better learning systems
for the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's all about working together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what happens and what I see in
this industry particularly is people start
[SPEAKER_03]: to get competitive very quickly,
meaning while we haven't even started
[SPEAKER_03]: scratching the surface with respect to
where this plant is and where regulations
[SPEAKER_03]: are, I think we can all agree that the
cannabis industry is only going to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: from here where we are at today in 2024.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very much the start of the industry
as opposed to being a mature phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be way more consumption
of cannabis that occurs on a global basis,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we've got to be able to work together
as an industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with Shana completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are certain competitive aspects,
but if you're not going to start to engage
[SPEAKER_03]: regulators and not going to start to
create a learning management system and
[SPEAKER_03]: education platforms and share information,
it's just going to make everyone's job
[SPEAKER_03]: harder, particularly the regulator.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're coming forward as an industry,
you need to have a collective
[SPEAKER_03]: collaborative voice so that you're able to
make meaningful change with regulators
[SPEAKER_03]: because the last thing regulators want to
see is an industry that's disjointed and
[SPEAKER_03]: not speaking from a single voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's very important to share
learnings with each other and actually be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to have conversations like this and
others to be able to bring out that
[SPEAKER_03]: information.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always say we need trust, honesty,
collaboration, THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody else heard that from Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny that when I think about the
groups that I've seen historically that
[SPEAKER_02]: have put together some of these
regulations, there's someone from the lab
[SPEAKER_02]: side on pharma, useless, sorry,
useless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two analytes go inside of a pharmaceutical
product, the obscipient and the drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the easiest thing in the world to
test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrong person to be on that panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: There should be one person in a hoodie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That there should be a master grower from
somewhere that is in a hoodie that gets
[SPEAKER_02]: it, that has been there growing it for 20
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's not one person on that table in
a hoodie, guy or girl, I've seen amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: female growers out there, there should be
one because that is the one side of this
[SPEAKER_02]: that I think when you get to the end of
these regulations, you go, this is the reg
[SPEAKER_02]: I want and then go back to zinc and
they'll go, but every plant has zinc so
[SPEAKER_02]: let's just throw that law in the garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every plant has microbials so it would be
good to take these regulations,
[SPEAKER_02]: go back to a grower and say, show me you
can grow this before I tell the world that
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're an amazing grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no doubt in your skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so tuned in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a great operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prove to me you can grow to this standard
because right now if you can't,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have literally created the impossible
scenario that nobody could grow into.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the one thing I think we do have
a rich group of people over the world that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've taught to and I'll tell you,
every once in a while all of a
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation was about somebody that
starts weird tangent and by the time
[SPEAKER_02]: you're done you're like, that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how that has never come to
light and how do I bring you into this
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation because you've gone down a
path for 25 years growing outdoors in this
[SPEAKER_02]: scenario with this and that and you found
ways of getting everything to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to be a part of this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So more hoodies at the round table,
that'll help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it for our panelists first of
all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always tell people all the time,
if you're a suit, find a hippie.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a hippie, find a suit and then
we can all work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everybody all at once.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold it close to your face.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things I want to ask is we're
speaking about, for example, the STM and
[SPEAKER_05]: teaching, a teaching platform.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what John just said earlier,
you need somebody in a hoodie.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a disconnect between the
industry and the consumer.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also, not everybody speaks
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some doctors don't speak cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there a way other than just teaching
growers or the regulators, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_05]: on what steps or what they need to take
into account for the regulation to go
[SPEAKER_05]: through.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as you need to have everybody,
not just somebody in a hoodie.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need somebody in the police
department.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you do need pharma, but you also need
a priest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love the Pope to say cannabis is
okay and it's just a domino effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not the subject for anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to get high with the Pope.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could solve a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think what you're, you kind of get
back to this big problem that we talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about in Canada, which is removing the
stigma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, if you want to say,
where does the removal of the stigma
[SPEAKER_02]: start?
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts with you and you and you and you
and you and you and you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts with telling your grandma she
should be taking CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it goes to that person who can't
sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what, CBN really works really
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think, you know, keeping that
conversation and keeping it a serious
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation at that level helps for that
kind of remove the stigma.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you get to the Pope, I'll throw that
down the panel because I myself am not a
[SPEAKER_02]: religious person, so I don't know much,
but there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in general, it's super important
that we, like I always say, the people who
[SPEAKER_04]: have the money should give the money to
the people who do the work, aka your local
[SPEAKER_04]: activists.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you should all support also engaging
those kind of initiatives who engage and
[SPEAKER_04]: people who do the education like Micha.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe support some of those activities
and that we can really see where the
[SPEAKER_04]: information gets into the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we can create the learning systems
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, if you, if you look at the
nutraceutical industry, a new
[SPEAKER_02]: nutraceutical comes out every couple of
years, but it takes seven years before
[SPEAKER_02]: people are like, you know what,
curcumin actually works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually works.
[SPEAKER_02]: But curcumin and turmeric have been around
here for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Curcumin was isolated about 10 years ago
inside of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even that product that has no stigma
before, before it actually sinks in and
[SPEAKER_02]: people go, yeah, it works, it takes a very
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the patient side of it and the
kind of, the constant hit of water is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, water defeats rock, not by being
strong, but by being consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I think that's kind of the path we
need to take here as we look at that
[SPEAKER_02]: stigma and breaking that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just sharing personal stories is
so valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I come up here and I talk about
regulations and safety and all that jazz,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what really hits home is hearing
stories of how cannabis has helped people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So share your story and that'll encourage
the next person to share their story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it spreads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you get buy-in from all
different groups of individuals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just make a counterpoint to that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, education is more
about, you know, teaching and learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think as much as we need to be
teaching, which I agree, I agree with,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we also need to be learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that cannabis is not a benign
substance.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that has some kind of risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we as an industry need to be open
to be able to also having that
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's actually properly understand the
risks, right, that are associated with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, because you lack complete
credibility when you're coming from a
[SPEAKER_03]: one-way perspective in terms of how great
everything is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly there's a number of great
things, but I also think we need to be
[SPEAKER_03]: receptive to learning about some of the
risks, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where countries like Canada are
doing a lot of work in terms of gathering
[SPEAKER_03]: data.
[SPEAKER_03]: What has the impact been to driving?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the impact been under age access?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's, there's pros and cons
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think generally things are moving really
well, but there are certain aspects that
[SPEAKER_03]: we may need to tweak, such as age of
access.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's important to be receptive
and also learn from others in this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something I call it the educated
decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we should enable an educated decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's only possible if you know all
different aspects.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there are a lot of studies from
all over all the time, constantly going
[SPEAKER_07]: back 20, 30, almost 40 years, showing the
efficacy of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think when you're dealing with the
scientists, you maybe want to get these
[SPEAKER_07]: studies into their hands, but also,
you know, it's just an uphill battle.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to fight 80 years of propaganda
every time, every time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's so, you have to go so
individually.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no magic wand that you can wave
and everybody will get it right away.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, if it were easy,
I guess it would be done already.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we have two more minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have two more minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you like to sing a song?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but maybe we have one more question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we have one more question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Derek always asks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not such a good singer, so I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an exception, I don't have a question,
but I do feel it as a challenge because
[SPEAKER_00]: John dumped on the Dutch and I'm Dutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point you make is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the coffee shop we've not tested
at all, but I think people should
[SPEAKER_00]: understand it's actually forbidden by law
for a coffee shop to get the weed tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some coffee shops they
started about four or five years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically illegitimately, so illegally
having the weed tested, but they still do
[SPEAKER_00]: it because they want to have that service
for the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that they don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that they cannot do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my brother actually lives in the
Netherlands and it wasn't until I went
[SPEAKER_02]: over there and I was like, oh shit,
this is how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, you know, for me it was
like, oh, maybe, you know, they sell weed
[SPEAKER_02]: in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll put a lab here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't even test.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just such a mind-blowing experience
to me that years people have been coming
[SPEAKER_02]: to these coffee shops, years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the amount of times I hear right
now that's like, if I could get my hands
[SPEAKER_02]: on that original skunk seed from
Amsterdam, cross it with my ice cream cake
[SPEAKER_02]: and my gelato, I've got fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're still looking back at the
Netherlands as these like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the pyramids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, wow, how did they build these
things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, wow, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet today it's like Egypt's not even
part of the global economy is what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the rest of these things that we're
looking back to these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm worried about with the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you had this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had this point and you could have
literally been the spot that everything
[SPEAKER_02]: became the jump point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, could I take, give me the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't rub it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm going to rub it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you I'm going to dunk on you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, do the Dutch really want that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the Dutch like to be quiet,
but they like to be quiet and cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't necessarily want to be,
oh, look at us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're Dutch weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine, just take a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if you put his much effort into
chrysanthemum studies as you did cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: we would, I would have no job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys could do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's give a round of applause for the
panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it again for our panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: We love Lisa Hogg so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the International Cannabis
Business Conference Berlin 2024.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
