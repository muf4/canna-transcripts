[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you Alex Rogers for putting
this together and I think speak for all of
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a pleasure to be here My name is
Luke Richner Regulatory landscape and
[SPEAKER_01]: navigating in it is kind of something I've
been slid I slid in through into over the
[SPEAKER_01]: last couple of years I'll share a bit more
about that in a second I'd like to give my
[SPEAKER_01]: esteemed colleagues here a chance to
deduce themselves before we jump into the
[SPEAKER_01]: panel and Share a bit of our insights what
has happened in the world so far and where
[SPEAKER_01]: this is hopefully going and See if we can
actually make sense of this industry after
[SPEAKER_04]: the next 40 minutes Anthony Yeah First and
foremost honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot to all the organizers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Anthony charring I'm from Canon
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the head legal analyst there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We provide provide a market and legal
Analysis and data for the cannabis sector
[SPEAKER_04]: as a lawyer in the US For several years
before moving to Barcelona, Spain Quite an
[SPEAKER_04]: upgrade in my opinion very happy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been there about seven years I Am dr.
Sean of Ricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a head of research and toxicology at
true terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my PhD studying chemistry of vaping
and then I switched over to true terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: and Created their toxicology program with
all that research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been able to educate lawmakers And
regulators and help actually write the
[SPEAKER_00]: language that goes into laws And then also
I've been able to support manufacturers if
[SPEAKER_00]: it does come to legal proceedings Hi
everyone Deepak Anand, I'm the head of
[SPEAKER_03]: consulting at gateway proven strategies
been around the space quite a few years
[SPEAKER_03]: just over 11 years but very closely with a
number of governments on cannabis policy
[SPEAKER_03]: and regulations starting in North America
and then Kind of moving across the world
[SPEAKER_03]: on a global basis Done a lot of work in
Europe as well both in the medical
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and also CBD sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: So happy to be here today My name is Lucas
McCann I'm CSO and co-founder of a
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory and scientific cannabis
consulting company called Cann Delta I
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a background in medicinal organic
chemistry medicinal and synthetic organic
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry after I finished my PhD I moved
over to Health Canada worked there in the
[SPEAKER_02]: inspectorate branch for health products
and as you may know Health Canada is the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulator for the medical and now
recreational cannabis streams in Canada
[SPEAKER_02]: Following that it started a consulting
company with another Health Canada
[SPEAKER_02]: inspector Cann Delta where I've got a team
of 25 folks were active Across Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've helped launch over 300 businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've recently moved into the US
specifically the Tri-state area in New
[SPEAKER_02]: York, New Jersey done a lot of work down
south in many of the Bible Belt states,
[SPEAKER_02]: Alabama, Texas Mississippi and have also
done some work internationally as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to be here Well absolute pleasure a
bit about what what brought me in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and kind of will lead into this
in a second is as being from Switzerland
[SPEAKER_01]: and Always seeing, you know, what is
Canada doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the US doing the trailblazers of
the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the regulatory frameworks?
[SPEAKER_01]: What were standards?
[SPEAKER_01]: What were the different?
[SPEAKER_01]: question marks and Between that realized
that it didn't speak a Harmonized language
[SPEAKER_01]: what was done in the US didn't really
speak to at the time how I saw European
[SPEAKER_01]: medical at least and and other standards
kind of Can be can be harmonized in the
[SPEAKER_01]: back end and that led then to me kind of
starting something something from scratch
[SPEAKER_01]: and trying to really bring those different
well regulatory frameworks is a big word,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Well, you have standardization and you
have different parts that feed into that
[SPEAKER_01]: and Well bringing those together and and
harmonizing certain points there was one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the big things that I put on my Cap and
with having you know, a couple of the
[SPEAKER_01]: esteemed gentlemen lady over here Shauna
you've been very outspoken early in this
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you bring standards?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you bring regulatory frameworks?
[SPEAKER_01]: What were some of the early channel
challenges you saw over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: and how did you bring the industry into
this and what were your approaches and
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you share from from those early
days?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the early days of regulations one thing
that I noticed and They're getting better
[SPEAKER_00]: at now is using very umbrella terms to
create regulations And a lot of times they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't understand everything that falls
under that umbrella term So they tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: overregulate beyond even what the
lawmakers are intending to and then
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes they are regulating with the
you know with the message of safety
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer safety But most of the time
regulators do not have any scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: background at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these laws don't actually protect the
health And safety of consumers so a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I've done is to educate them on this
is how you write regulations To protect
[SPEAKER_00]: your end consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think the two gentlemen over there have
been also very engaged in the early days
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that you Remember from back then
that we now in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at this stage where we can you know,
we can still influence We can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: we're part of this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we learn from back then that we
can kind of move into I think that for a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of us who are coming from North
America here to Germany and Learning about
[SPEAKER_02]: the regulatory framework that's coming
into play here based on this beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: leak the alarm bells, I think are ringing
for us and I think there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: lessons learned that we've seen from other
markets that if Germany doesn't think
[SPEAKER_02]: about implementing very seriously,
you know after Pillar one and pillar two
[SPEAKER_02]: or even throughout this process Are going
to result in a framework that ultimately
[SPEAKER_02]: will fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's some very very important
considerations and there are some major
[SPEAKER_02]: gaps and some of those gaps I think
include, you know number one for what all
[SPEAKER_02]: good robust fair Regulation should really
include and that some means of restorative
[SPEAKER_02]: justice and that can include elements of
social equity it can include Putting those
[SPEAKER_02]: in line who are affected by cannabis
prohibition It must include a means of
[SPEAKER_02]: safe reliable access for patients and I
haven't seen any means of How Germany at
[SPEAKER_02]: this point intends to transition those
from the illicit market or the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: movement into this new market No applause
yet excellent Excellent excellent points
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'd echo in addition to what
Lucas's is has already said, you know I
[SPEAKER_03]: think it's very important for us to look
back particularly from a European
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective That's what what's happened
previously and what is happening before we
[SPEAKER_03]: can go forward So when you look at medical
cannabis in Europe to your point Luke on
[SPEAKER_03]: harmonization still a lack of
harmonization across Europe, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean harmonization is the pillar of the
European Union and the fact that we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have a single monograph of flower which
has been talked about for The last three
[SPEAKER_03]: years is is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got you know what seven eight plus
European countries that are all selling
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis flower and have been for the last
You know over six seven years where
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no harmonized framework So if
you're a cultivator or a producer that
[SPEAKER_03]: operates Anywhere you've got, you know
arguably 10 12 up to 20 different
[SPEAKER_03]: frameworks you need to follow Germany is
completely different from Poland is
[SPEAKER_03]: completely different from Denmark is
completely different from Switzerland So
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're trying to sell the same flower
into those five markets You've got five
[SPEAKER_03]: sets of regulatory frameworks to follow
and that never happens in Europe,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe is all about harmonization So I
think the dialogue with regulators is
[SPEAKER_03]: critically important right now to be
having not only at a national level But
[SPEAKER_03]: also at a European Commission level and
it's incumbent on companies now to start
[SPEAKER_03]: Holding regulators feet to the fire to
actually make that happen and make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: there is at a minimum There's no
explanation why there isn't a European
[SPEAKER_03]: monograph for flower currently So you got
to start and fix the medical program
[SPEAKER_03]: before you can start to speculate and
what's happening is pure speculation on a
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational program Yeah, I think that
those are great points.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean there's you know, just like we saw
in the US With this patchwork of
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just take CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, you know, you have 50
different states with very different
[SPEAKER_04]: policies Different products that they do
allow don't allow and we're seeing that
[SPEAKER_04]: same type of you know patchwork framework
That you know now in Europe that has that
[SPEAKER_04]: has really been imported and creates a
whole lot of issues From you know THC
[SPEAKER_04]: levels in hemp You know, at least in the
US it's pretty standardized under the
[SPEAKER_04]: federal law, but you know, we now see
Anywhere from point two percent,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know now member states not moving up
to point three, but then we have you know
[SPEAKER_04]: countries like Switzerland Czech Republic
at one percent, you know these these just
[SPEAKER_04]: creates all kinds of you know hurdles for
the industry You know one thing that I do
[SPEAKER_04]: think that is interesting and even we
don't have to go far You know as far back
[SPEAKER_04]: as the early days, you know in North
America is you know What we're seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: happen with what we call IHDCs
intoxicating hemp derived cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_04]: Such as Delta 8 HHC You know, it does seem
that at least Europe is kind of learning
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the lessons that From some of the
maybe missteps that have been happening in
[SPEAKER_04]: the US with these these products where it
is just completely all over the board from
[SPEAKER_04]: You know statewide bands to the DEA
doesn't know really what the status is And
[SPEAKER_04]: then you know, but at least Europe my will
say, you know has been able to react a bit
[SPEAKER_04]: better They have some better mechanisms in
place to be able to You know address these
[SPEAKER_04]: new psychoactive substances And so,
you know, there there were a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: missteps I think in the US when it came to
that where they ended up, you know started
[SPEAKER_04]: having very unintended consequences like I
believe Washington with CBN where they
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to kind of ban the semi synthetic
process But then they realized actually
[SPEAKER_04]: that's how a lot of the CBN on the market
is so But yeah, at least I think Europe
[SPEAKER_04]: and kind of that aspect Has learned a
little bit but still kind of I think
[SPEAKER_04]: making some of the same Mistakes that were
made in the US in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have to try very hard to do worse
than what we have in the US You have to
[SPEAKER_02]: try very hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Would just piggyback of what Anthony
said on on CBD and I think the lack of
[SPEAKER_03]: global Regulation or misregulation and CBD
is probably one of the the worst things
[SPEAKER_03]: that we have it in the industry Because
you look at CBD, you know, it's available
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere US it's available Canada is
completely screwed up the regulation of
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD in my opinion because we've regulated
the same as THC which makes no sense And
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got the you know, you've got the
European Union now that's going down this
[SPEAKER_03]: novel foods pathway, which is great Except
that no one has clarity on the novel foods
[SPEAKER_03]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've got clients that are
wanting to apply for an FSA application
[SPEAKER_03]: and FSA just keeps raising the bar You
know you to do human trials and you do
[SPEAKER_03]: animal trials then you need to get into
human pregnancy trials I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's CBD for crime Out loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, it's available everywhere So
the global lack of regulation on CBD is
[SPEAKER_03]: just benign and before you can start to
regulate THC and look at recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis We've got to fix some existing
challenges and you can't make the bower so
[SPEAKER_03]: high that you're gonna have an illicit
market You know thrive or in the case of
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD just an unregulated market thrive Now
we've seen CBD big issues big different
[SPEAKER_01]: approaches big Well this harmonization I
would like to say We touched a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: the the medical side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes When I started with creating the
software is like, okay, what where do you
[SPEAKER_01]: go?
[SPEAKER_01]: so my what I do is kind of trying to
harmonize standards through through
[SPEAKER_01]: transparency and technology and And it was
like the easiest thing to do is EUGMP
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's the most defined Of course,
it's the hardest to reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most different steps and so forth
But at least you have a guidebook and in
[SPEAKER_01]: all those other parts, there is no
guidebook and I did have the pleasure a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit to or the pleasure of the owner
whatever you want to call it to to be
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in some of these working groups
in several countries and and a big part
[SPEAKER_01]: there was and that's my personal
experience and I'd like to hear a bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: from from your side was Whenever the
industry came together and gave kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: coherent thought through based on other
examples Input be it, you know looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the tobacco industry looking at other
industries looking at best-case practices
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at You know standardization in
food health safety standards and so forth
[SPEAKER_01]: whenever the industry came together and
really thought through proposed something
[SPEAKER_01]: Be it through associations be it through
individuals that were a bit, you know more
[SPEAKER_01]: active in certain parts I've always had
the experience that the ears were very
[SPEAKER_01]: open Now we all have a lot of friends in
the industry that all they do is complain
[SPEAKER_01]: every day and this is one of the moments
where I you know look into the audience
[SPEAKER_01]: and say if you really want to Navigate not
just through the regulatory landscape as
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes if you want to try to pave the
way a little bit in your direction it
[SPEAKER_01]: really helps to come together and You know
gather some thoughts and I know there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people on stage here that have been
involved in several approaches there if
[SPEAKER_01]: you could give you know one or two advices
towards the industry at this moment Right
[SPEAKER_01]: now in Europe where we still are at the
point where we can have influence We can
[SPEAKER_01]: still learn from the mistakes that were
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to go down the same routes
We don't have to you know Try to copy
[SPEAKER_01]: paste a framework that allowed for 400
tons overproduction or 70% illicit after
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years and so forth so Any you know
short advice that you would give to the
[SPEAKER_01]: audience based on the learnings that you
had from You know the US and Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we do now here?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Europe at this stage where the
regulators are very open.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ears are open.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can bring the input.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes There was a leak draft.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you that draft is not what's
going to go into action And there is the
[SPEAKER_01]: working groups are very active in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any two cents What can we do now to
kind of not complain after?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think one of the biggest things is
is is lobbying, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you've got to work You've got to
be able to work with your your politicians
[SPEAKER_03]: your local MPs MLA is MEPs on the European
Parliament level You've got to start
[SPEAKER_03]: engaging with them I think what has
happened in Canada is we've seen that now
[SPEAKER_03]: companies are starting to really get after
the government but Really weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: proactively doing as much as perhaps they
could have for example the dairy industry
[SPEAKER_03]: in Canada is severely regulated and When
they went through their crisis on
[SPEAKER_03]: taxation, I'm not advocating for killing
animals But they actually took cows to the
[SPEAKER_03]: legislature and started shooting them in
front of politicians To say this is what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're actually doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're killing our industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no choice because I can't keep
these cows around and so like you've got
[SPEAKER_03]: to make sure you're really getting in the
face of politicians and telling them why
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulatory change is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think on a European side.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to do the same thing You've got
to learn from the mistakes that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: made in places like Canada and there is
many mistakes that have been made There's
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly really some really good things
that have been adopted So you got to be
[SPEAKER_03]: presenting both sides of that coin very
early on Taxation is a huge one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I you know, there isn't a lot of
conversation happening around taxation,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I trust me once government Start get
used to that tax dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very hard to take that back and we're
seeing that in Canada So I think that sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of conversations needs to start happening
early companies that are raising money and
[SPEAKER_03]: some have raised a lot of money needs to
start engaging regulators and saying
[SPEAKER_03]: here's a report just make sure you don't
tax it and really coming and making that
[SPEAKER_04]: public and engaging with politicians on it
Yeah, I would yeah echo exactly what you
[SPEAKER_04]: said.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that you know if You know
legalization is to truly happen That there
[SPEAKER_04]: has to be an empowerment to have the
political courage to get it across the
[SPEAKER_04]: line and what I mean by that is You know,
we've now seeing it unfold in Germany
[SPEAKER_04]: where falling back to plan B and you know
really have to have some leaders who are
[SPEAKER_04]: willing to go that extra mile to to step
out there and be Leaders and pioneers and
[SPEAKER_04]: what they do because what we see,
you know, we track You know about 80
[SPEAKER_04]: countries globally and so whenever you
see, you know for a region someone who
[SPEAKER_04]: really steps out one jurisdiction one
country, you know, then their their
[SPEAKER_04]: neighbors start to look across the border
and see that Oh, actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're creating a lot of revenue and
they're you know, maybe our concerns about
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization or not You know actually
unfolding it like we thought You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say, you know Luke, you know We're
just in Prague about a month ago and we
[SPEAKER_04]: heard from the anti-drug coordinator there
You know very bold statements that were
[SPEAKER_04]: being made and I hope that to see more if
you know If things are really going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: moved forward, you know saying that you
know, we're going with plan a And we're
[SPEAKER_04]: not even talking about plan B because then
politicians are going to latch on to plan
[SPEAKER_04]: B and try to move forward with that but
you know, the government is messaging at
[SPEAKER_04]: least that they are going to You know go
full bore ahead with full legalization And
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that's the kind of attitude
that that you know has has to be in place
[SPEAKER_04]: That you need more than just allies,
but you need champions for policy change I
[SPEAKER_02]: think you get an important point to
consider also since Germany is now in the
[SPEAKER_02]: phase where you know, we're sort of at the
cusp here of legalization is leaving room
[SPEAKER_02]: for a product innovation and and for
innovation of companies to come in and
[SPEAKER_02]: really do a successful job and to Simulate
as much as possible I think the kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: products or the experience that people
have known to love about cannabis and and
[SPEAKER_02]: from the plant and I think you do that by
leaving room unfortunately for a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of profitability because ultimately
the goal here is for compliance and
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement to be To be active and to be
executed properly for companies to be
[SPEAKER_02]: compliant and produce safe product that
the industry is regulated but also to
[SPEAKER_02]: defeat the illicit market and protect
youth and To be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll need to be able to have commercial
companies involved in this that are that
[SPEAKER_02]: are somewhat for profit I mean from from a
commercial standpoint the recommendation I
[SPEAKER_02]: would give to those who are looking to
start a business would be to you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: think globally but have a very targeted
approach and how you set your business and
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the leading causes of failure in
the cannabis industry was what we saw in
[SPEAKER_02]: the first year of operation where
companies would acquire so many assets and
[SPEAKER_02]: so much territory and so many square
meters of growing space because they
[SPEAKER_02]: thought this was a competition this was
king of the hill and that ultimately led
[SPEAKER_02]: to the demise and the uprise of Kraft
cannabis products which were very low
[SPEAKER_02]: person per plant ratios and That is now
the highest amount of product being sold
[SPEAKER_02]: in in retail dispensaries in Canada is
from these Kraft Products because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: asset light and they have low licensing
fees So taking a very staggered approach
[SPEAKER_02]: to starting a business in cannabis is
ultimately the thing that will drive your
[SPEAKER_00]: success The best way to stay compliant
with regulations is to be proactive and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually help write the laws that go into
regulations And the only way to do that is
[SPEAKER_00]: to really band together and collaborate
With other businesses in this space form
[SPEAKER_00]: coalitions get lobby groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: These lobbyists can get you in the door
with these politicians find emails phone
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers of these politicians hand them out
to Everyone your patients can call and say
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like this part of the law I want
this to be written in the law like they
[SPEAKER_00]: can absolutely influence member your
politicians are there for the people and
[SPEAKER_00]: one lesson that I hope Europe takes a
lesson learned from the US is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: medical recreational CBD THC we need to
work together not against each other Just
[SPEAKER_03]: one more thing if I might add actually two
more things I'll say one is you got to
[SPEAKER_03]: remember that legalization is a process
It's not an event Especially when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: setting up companies, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't do this once and it's done and
that's the regulations right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is going to be a process regulators
fully understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a new industry To regulate and
it's industry's job to hold them
[SPEAKER_03]: accountable that right so as things
develop as We're developing new
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting safety information on vapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever it might be We've got to start
holding regulators feet to the fire and
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, you know The process needs to
evolve and so companies can't look and say
[SPEAKER_03]: alright legalization is done We've now got
a law and that's it and now we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: stick to this framework.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very much a very much a process
Talking about a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to Share a bit what we're doing in
Switzerland right now, which I think then
[SPEAKER_01]: also leads into The model projects in
Germany and gives us a chance to we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to speculate But maybe you know give
our two cents on where this this could go
[SPEAKER_01]: based on everything we've learned from
other industries From other jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_01]: and other parts of the world What we've
done in Switzerland was we assessed what
[SPEAKER_01]: was done outside then we looked At the
laws, you know the international treaties
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been signed one of them in 1961
a very special one which a lot of a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things are based on that a lot of global
trade is based on the single convention of
[SPEAKER_01]: 1961 and Under that it clearly states you
can either go, you know natural
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional medicine or you can go
research and research can be
[SPEAKER_01]: socio-economical and socio-cultural or as
we do in Switzerland and So what we've set
[SPEAKER_01]: up there we realized okay There is a gap
there that we can test how this market
[SPEAKER_01]: goes forward And instead of saying this
has worked there we do this this has
[SPEAKER_01]: worked there the government came up and
really Created I would say the most open
[SPEAKER_01]: framework out there in Switzerland at the
moment You can go you need to be part with
[SPEAKER_01]: the health ministry or you supply to the
health ministry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have the municipality you got
to have a cultivation manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution point of sale study nurse,
which is a qualified person police has to
[SPEAKER_01]: be involved and a research Institute as I
mentioned before and you can come up and
[SPEAKER_01]: come forward and really share how This
could work and I'll give two examples
[SPEAKER_01]: there Basel is there our first one that is
happening right now three hundred seventy
[SPEAKER_01]: two Consumers not patients have access to
regulated recreational THC Canada It is
[SPEAKER_01]: nine pharmacies that it's being
distributed through why nine pharmacies
[SPEAKER_01]: could it has a integrated Supply chain
that already is, you know fast and easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of work within compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reporting is done under general
narcotics law, so So that was the approach
[SPEAKER_01]: of Basel the easy one the fast one.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it was obviously very fast approved
Zurich went with 2,000 consumers at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are small numbers for you,
but we're a small country So it's quite
[SPEAKER_01]: significant for their Compared to the
amount of actual users and there is 21
[SPEAKER_01]: points of sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be social clubs It can be and we
have this thing that if you you know drop
[SPEAKER_01]: points if you are an addict for heroin you
get methadone governments and government
[SPEAKER_01]: support it and And normal dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did Switzerland do Switzerland
allowed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stakeholder driven approach to understand
all the different needs and challenges
[SPEAKER_01]: that are within This industry so they
didn't say in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like this and in the US it's like
this and I think what is very forward
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking what I like about that approach
is that we really Everybody has the chance
[SPEAKER_01]: to come up with a thesis and share why it
would work like this in their direction So
[SPEAKER_01]: you have I would say the first and only
real all stakeholder approach towards how
[SPEAKER_01]: to then create a legal framework and in
the I think a year ago I spoke about this
[SPEAKER_01]: and everybody said well the Swiss,
you know the Swiss small country They do
[SPEAKER_01]: what they do a couple of months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany went the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So We have a lot of opportunities on the
table there and I just like to you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some insights from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What what would you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even gonna ask how would you put
your perfect model project together?
[SPEAKER_01]: But now you have the chance with the magic
wand.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you set this up for the future?
[SPEAKER_03]: I Wanted to be some Switzerland really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great that they've started to
move forward with the pilot projects,
[SPEAKER_03]: but Unfortunately patients have been left
behind It was only until last year that
[SPEAKER_03]: Switzerland actually started allowing
medical cannabis to really meaningfully be
[SPEAKER_03]: sold It was it was they had a legal
program for a while now, but certainly not
[SPEAKER_03]: to level that that 20 years That's that's
happened, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So and now access is starting to be
available and certainly the recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis pilot projects are definitely a
model way for Europe to be following and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's Refreshing that Switzerland is
actually taking that approach Now because
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it really is in very interesting
way to comply with UN treaties You
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned UN treaties earlier and I think
that's a very creative compliant way to
[SPEAKER_03]: come up with it And I think that's exactly
what we did in Canada, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We basically looked at UN treaties.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know we're technically in violation of
UN treaties But it's a principal
[SPEAKER_03]: non-compliant approach that we decided to
take in Canada We had kids under the age
[SPEAKER_03]: of 18 that were accessing cannabis at a
higher rate than any other country in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world and so we Decided to regulate it so
we could start to actually have
[SPEAKER_03]: conversations with you around that So I
think it's important to be making sure
[SPEAKER_03]: we're taking you know care of some of the
foundational stuff patients I think is one
[SPEAKER_03]: Lucas bought up the social equity piece I
mean that's another really important one
[SPEAKER_03]: and that can be built into these
legislations and that needs to start
[SPEAKER_03]: happening very early and it also then sort
of enables countries to go to the UN and
[SPEAKER_03]: have a meaningful dialogue to change these
treaties because That's eventually what
[SPEAKER_03]: needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're obviously going To have
countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia
[SPEAKER_03]: that are vehemently opposed, you know to
cannabis legalization But at least then
[SPEAKER_03]: you start to get more and more people on
your side is when you've had a robust
[SPEAKER_03]: system when you've factored in social
equity when you factored in You know age
[SPEAKER_03]: of access you factored in a number of
conditions within the country So I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: that's quite important the data approach
like clinical trials I think if we were
[SPEAKER_02]: starting from scratch, it would be you
know Let's isolate this compound these
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds these cannabinoids, you know
over 130 of them the cannabis plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: actually conduct the research because
regulations are based off of public
[SPEAKER_02]: consultation, but also the sort of the
political stance of the the regulators the
[SPEAKER_02]: politicians involved in creating these
regulations and Public consultation is
[SPEAKER_02]: fueled from the actual data that's
available the scientific data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having that data in hand I think would
create a set of regulations that is much
[SPEAKER_02]: more Fair and robust and really pays
attention to you know what cannabis can do
[SPEAKER_04]: and what THC is really capable of And you
know, I'm not going to present here a
[SPEAKER_04]: thesis on the model regulatory framework,
but I mean, I think you know whenever
[SPEAKER_04]: we're talking About adult use or
recreational use two very important
[SPEAKER_04]: factors I mean, well first and foremost
you're gonna have to be the illicit market
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know two ways that I think are
very important one of which is Being done
[SPEAKER_04]: to some extent and one not so much one
being is accessibility I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got to be able to you know,
have a wide range of products that are
[SPEAKER_04]: available Because if they're not going to
be provided in the illicit market and
[SPEAKER_04]: people folks will just go straight back to
the illicit market but then also The the
[SPEAKER_04]: stigma around consumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that even in the US Still,
you know, we are seeing some consumption
[SPEAKER_04]: lounges.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm starting to you know take place now,
but you know, you look at like the even
[SPEAKER_04]: the the German Framework that's been
leaked is you know, there's still the
[SPEAKER_04]: stigma around Around consumption and you
have to bring consumers out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: shadows, you know, even in the the German
Framework, they're saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: there would be no consumption allowed in
the clubs You know home grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to keep it very, you know,
your neighbors can't even see the children
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so, you know, but there's still the
stigma around consumption I think as long
[SPEAKER_04]: as that stigma is still around it's gonna
be very hard to compete with the illicit
[SPEAKER_01]: market The consumption lounge is also are
there is no smoking clubs anymore So
[SPEAKER_01]: there's there's again there is many
different aspects that feed into this from
[SPEAKER_01]: different parts from other industry We
have in Barcelona if anyone they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal and I'll shout that out there
every single Club in Barcelona is illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gray area that was made for another
for another Issue which was heroin
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption in the 70s and 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a legal model and Yes,
you can smoke inside there and it's nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: is you know, no repression on them and I
think what really is important is that we
[SPEAKER_01]: got to find a legal model not saying now
legalize it or whatever this is this but
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to find a set of rules and
regulations That on one hand side works
[SPEAKER_01]: for the industry and on the other hand
side works for the regulator I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: heard harm reduction enough on this stage
is very important in Europe anything that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens in opening anything towards the UN
would be very much in the focus of harm
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction and not creating, you know,
just a flourishing industry and And in
[SPEAKER_01]: general, yes, there are these different
models out there and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not being They're not not being
Chased or whatever you want to call it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but That lack of actual regulatory
harmonization behind which is what would
[SPEAKER_01]: then in the future allow us to kind of
work together across, you know across the
[SPEAKER_01]: pond and towards Asia and There's some
some, you know standardization approaches
[SPEAKER_01]: around that are trying to move into that
and I think one of the big things at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment Deepak we quickly touched it before
is there are There are bodies in place
[SPEAKER_01]: that regulate narcotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a narcotics board from the UN and
Still the industry wants to kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: do their own way in their own direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Well open question there if we where
should we as an industry try to drive this
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually?
[SPEAKER_01]: Realistically based on best-case practices
from around move this whole Or navigate
[SPEAKER_01]: through the regulatory landscape to bring
this industry further I think the UN
[SPEAKER_03]: Treaty one is is really interesting and I
think you brought up the INCB particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the International Narcotics
Control Board and basically their job is
[SPEAKER_03]: to monitor control activities of what
would be an illicit subs or control
[SPEAKER_03]: substance And you know despite
legalization in Canada You still have
[SPEAKER_03]: reporting requirements to the INCB because
they want to know what's happening and
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada has done a really bad job And I
think that's where you get into challenges
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got hundreds of kilos that when
missing at the Ontario Cannabis store and
[SPEAKER_03]: no one could account for where they went
in a fully regulated track and trace seat
[SPEAKER_03]: to sale High vaults, you know dozens of
cameras yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've had cannabis magically gone missing
I think the INCB is going to start looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at that and going you've actually done a
pretty poor job on regulating that so I
[SPEAKER_03]: think having compliance systems is very
important and I think it's refreshing even
[SPEAKER_03]: on the Swiss case to hear that
Switzerland's actually Outsourcing some of
[SPEAKER_03]: those activities because in Canada what
the government did was implement an
[SPEAKER_03]: internal track and trace system where
everyone had to report into them and we
[SPEAKER_03]: know governments do a horrible job
managing IT systems generally and I think
[SPEAKER_03]: that's really been a poor thing that we've
seen in Canada So again a takeaway that
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry can say is suggest an
external entity that everyone can agree to
[SPEAKER_03]: a process through which you'd comply with
those reporting obligations So you aren't
[SPEAKER_03]: on side with INCB, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to make your life easier
because I can tell you the CTLS which is
[SPEAKER_03]: our cannabis tracking licensing system is
is a ridiculous System to be using and
[SPEAKER_03]: managing and it clearly doesn't work the
fact that you've got hundreds of kilos of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis disappear magically Something's
not working on a personal note.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very happy that they kept it the way
they kept it I approached him in 2018 and
[SPEAKER_01]: asked him if I can bring this or learn
from this system bring it to Europe They
[SPEAKER_01]: said no, this is Canada only we don't want
to deal with outside countries The
[SPEAKER_01]: underlying basis of it is the GS1
international standards for supply chain
[SPEAKER_01]: transparency, which is a global
non-for-profit and it gave me the chance
[SPEAKER_01]: To build a product on that, but we have
three minutes 40 seconds and Gaio stood up
[SPEAKER_01]: when Gaio stands up That means something.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're not done yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sorry Any any closing statements
by all of you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you take from the panel and you
know again navigating through the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory landscape?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think creating a pathway for research is
going to be very important for success not
[SPEAKER_02]: just in Germany, but in any other market
as well Allowing the partnership between
[SPEAKER_02]: either government or commercial entities
and non-profit not-for-profits Those like
[SPEAKER_02]: universities who are conducting clinical
trials phase one phase two phase three and
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding what it is this is capable
of these medical cannabis products and
[SPEAKER_02]: Allowing claims to be associated to these
products so that we can get that monograph
[SPEAKER_02]: that Deepak was referring to for medicinal
cannabis products I think that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: the path forward From my side.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll really be three things one
Don't chase sign shiny objects wait until
[SPEAKER_03]: the regulations actually develop I think
what we are seeing is a lot of What we saw
[SPEAKER_03]: in Canada very early on is what we're
seeing in 23 at least in certain European
[SPEAKER_03]: countries particularly Germany And you
know slow down right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to we need to understand what the
regulations are actually saying I think
[SPEAKER_03]: we've really put the cart before the horse
Developing business plans and figuring out
[SPEAKER_03]: what products we're gonna sell and really
there's a leak draft that's out there in
[SPEAKER_03]: the ether so I think You need to walk
before you run and really understand what
[SPEAKER_03]: the regulations are going to be the second
I'll say is all politics is local So,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we touched on this a little bit
but I can't restress the importance of
[SPEAKER_03]: making change locally and going to your
politicians and kind of really working
[SPEAKER_03]: closely with them and the last thing I'll
say is you know, just the importance of
[SPEAKER_03]: You know working collaboratively as an
industry right being part of European
[SPEAKER_03]: medical cannabis industry associations or
any of the various organizations that
[SPEAKER_03]: exist I think It's it's critical for the
industry to have a single voice both at
[SPEAKER_03]: the national and the international level
or the European level And I think you know
[SPEAKER_03]: banding together and making sure that
you're building the industry to
[SPEAKER_03]: collaboratively is a responsibility of the
industry I Would just like to stress if
[SPEAKER_00]: you are a manufacturer processor anything
like that to regulate yourself beyond what
[SPEAKER_00]: the current regulations may be because
current regulations are Very fluid they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to change, you know, so for example
Start with child safe packaging even if
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe that's not required in your
providence or country or state and then
[SPEAKER_00]: next I just want to kind of repeat what
Deepak said is Collaborate with the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and collaborate with your
regulators It is much better to be friends
[SPEAKER_00]: with your regulators than enemies with
them start that conversation early often
[SPEAKER_00]: Collaborate and form a very strong team
with other people in the canvas industry
[SPEAKER_04]: and Yeah, we talked a lot about the kind
of patchwork regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the successful companies in
this space, you know have some agility
[SPEAKER_04]: Baked into what that what they do because
there is so much regulatory change and
[SPEAKER_04]: patchwork So, you know, we try to empower
our clients doing that through things like
[SPEAKER_04]: daily tracking Not just you know bill a is
going through this, you know, here's its
[SPEAKER_04]: current state But tracking those
discussions those debates that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: narrow in on, you know where there is
agreement where there is Some consensus
[SPEAKER_04]: and what may change in the future so that
companies can be a little more agile you
[SPEAKER_04]: know and how they operate and navigating
that landscape and You don't see this but
[SPEAKER_01]: we literally on the second are at zero
zero zero right now So I would like to
[SPEAKER_01]: thank my panelists here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we did a great job and now is the
time for applause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Much applause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it again You You
