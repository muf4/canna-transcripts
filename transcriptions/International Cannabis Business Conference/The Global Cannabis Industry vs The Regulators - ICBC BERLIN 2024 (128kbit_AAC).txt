[SPEAKER_03]: To lead us on this, attorney-at-law from
MME Legal and a leading visionary in the
[SPEAKER_03]: field, let's hear it for Daniel Heyman.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, may I ask the panelists here to sit
down as well?
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish it was a Westling match.
[SPEAKER_07]: A Westling match is over after I don't
know what 15 minutes or a few times three
[SPEAKER_07]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is taking years and I've lost my
hair in the process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my name is Daniel Heyman.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a lawyer from Switzerland,
previous commodities trader.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the co-founder of the International
Cannabis Bar Association Europe chapter
[SPEAKER_07]: together with Kai, another lawyer
colleague of mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do a lot of corporate work and also
product regulatory specifically in the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm quite excited to have a few super
interesting people with me here and I will
[SPEAKER_07]: let them make their introductions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gaspar, Lisa, Frederick and Atiya.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Atiya you can take it away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe one two minute introduction.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we go in this direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Atiya Feroz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the founder of AgCan Consultancy,
which is a consulting firm that offers
[SPEAKER_01]: operations, post-harvest, quality
assurance and tissue culture consulting,
[SPEAKER_01]: specializing in emerging markets all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also the founder of the International
Cannabis Quality Standards Association,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a group that was formed earlier
this year to bring together industry
[SPEAKER_01]: stakeholders and thought leaders and
develop industry best practice guides as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as provide information and
consultation services to regulators and
[SPEAKER_01]: policy makers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, my name is Frederick Borgsloff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, unless what is written there,
I'm a lawyer from Berlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: As an entrepreneur, I took part in the
first tender 2017, then in the second
[SPEAKER_04]: tender and we applied with a company we
created for imported wholesale license.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since a couple of years, we are
offering our services to clients from
[SPEAKER_04]: especially Israel, Africa and French.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Lisa Haag.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the CEO and founder of MG Universe
GmbH.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are a strategic consulting company,
but we're also operating our own projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys maybe know Kraut Invest,
a B2B magazine for the German cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry and beyond.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm also part of the board of the
German industry representation.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find us outside in the exhibition
hall if you want to know anything about
[SPEAKER_05]: lobby work in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Gasper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the chief compliance officer for the
Thalmann Group and a licensed attorney.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my experience with cannabis first came
as my job as an attorney, as a defense
[SPEAKER_02]: attorney.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I went into the cannabis industry
like a year and a half, two years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm pretty new to this, still learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Thalmann Group now basically what
we're doing is we're connecting different
[SPEAKER_02]: participants in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learn something new every day and I
expect to do it even today.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we say time working in the
cannabis industry is like dog years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've been in the industry for a while
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen you here a few times.
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk today about the
challenges faced by the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_07]: the biggest regulatory challenges,
the relationship between the regulators
[SPEAKER_07]: and the regulated in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to address you guys with the
first question.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are the biggest challenges in this
industry that you face?
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoever wants to take it up first?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, from what I learned is that we
don't have a constant, especially in
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany where we have a federal system,
all the regulators more or less apply the
[SPEAKER_04]: rules in a different way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to give you a little example.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have two clients, both of them from
Israel, both of them want to obtain EUGMP,
[SPEAKER_04]: so we need an audit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The regulator from Bavaria allows an
online audit for obvious reasons,
[SPEAKER_04]: actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other one, we are struggling with
the regulator.
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to argue, well, there's an MRR.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Israeli GMP is basically way more
harder than the European one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And more or less we're stuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know when the political
situation in Israel will be better and the
[SPEAKER_04]: clients want that early.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're eager to obtain EUGMP and to be
able to market their product.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's super interesting, but you're
already going really quite into the
[SPEAKER_07]: specifics.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I asked.
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's start a bit more in the meta
field because essentially there's one
[SPEAKER_07]: overarching theme on the highest level,
which is the narcotic, the Staatsvertr√§ge,
[SPEAKER_07]: basically.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where it starts, the international
conventions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you can speak about that and why the
single convention may be one of the
[SPEAKER_07]: biggest impediments to a harmonized
framework?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm saying that for a very long
time, that for us as the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, the single convention is
actually a big, big trade barrier.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is limiting us because of the status
of the flower and the resin as a narcotic
[SPEAKER_05]: drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: That has a lot of implications.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also, to a certain degree, provides the
framework.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, that's not only the only
aspect in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the biggest global aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I also see a lot of limitations
and restrictions through the appropriate
[SPEAKER_05]: marketing category.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that I call category
appropriate marketing so that really the
[SPEAKER_05]: companies understand what category their
ingredient relates to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, here the focus is really more on
those things like the cannabis flower and
[SPEAKER_05]: the resin, but there are way other areas,
like also in construction or in developing
[SPEAKER_05]: novel cellular-based solutions that are
highly limited through that barrier.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the barriers, really,
I would say, in the single convention is
[SPEAKER_07]: that it only allows cross-border
cooperation in the field.
[SPEAKER_07]: It only allows cross-border cooperation in
the field of scientific research and in
[SPEAKER_07]: the medical space.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it doesn't open up anything for the
recreational space, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That, I would say, is like the first level
of challenge that we have, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, we as members of the European
Union, I mean, you're a bit different from
[SPEAKER_02]: Switzerland, besides, well, because you,
besides the UN Convention, we also have
[SPEAKER_02]: the European legislations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we all know, the UN, they have no,
actually no punitive approach towards
[SPEAKER_02]: countries who would be in breach.
[SPEAKER_02]: While the European Commission,
they have quite severe punishes that could
[SPEAKER_02]: be inflicted on the member states that
would break it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for European member states,
that's an additional issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as a European state, we would have
it hard to allow ourselves to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, like what Canada did or what
some other countries did because European
[SPEAKER_02]: commissions, like they have had experience
in Germany when they first came to the
[SPEAKER_02]: European Commission and asked,
could we legalize recreational use?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were told, quite frankly,
no, you cannot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will sue you in front of the court.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so enforcement is a big issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, what you addressed really is the
interpretation of what cannabis means,
[SPEAKER_07]: the definition in the single convention,
which really does not distinguish because
[SPEAKER_07]: the single convention was created at the
time where people have not discovered THC
[SPEAKER_07]: yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it actually comprises everything
that's derived from the cannabis plant and
[SPEAKER_07]: from the fruiting tops and so on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these definitions, do you think the
interpretation of these definitions,
[SPEAKER_07]: is that something universal or is it
something where you have an individual
[SPEAKER_07]: interpretation in each jurisdiction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd say that every single country
comes at cannabis with usually not enough
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so their understanding of the
different plant components and what they
[SPEAKER_01]: contain and what the potential uses of
them are is very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just helping one of my clients go
through the narcotics licensing in
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had a meeting with the
regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, OK, so we want you to
destroy all of the cannabis waste that has
[SPEAKER_01]: THC in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, THC or THCA?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just stared at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, the leaves in the stocks
don't have THC inside of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at a certain level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we going with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, your rule is anything below 1% THC
is hemp material, CBD material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you want to do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were just completely lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't understand that it's not
everything is consistent throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we ended up having a chat with
them about is saying, OK, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: how about when we do our first few rounds
of destruction, we'll actually do an HPLC
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis for the level of THC,
THCA in the different types of waste
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can prove to you that it's below
the threshold, can we just throw it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: regular garbage?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, OK, yeah, that seems
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to come up with these
solutions yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we have to pay for our
destruction in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're paying a lot of extra money to
haul off product that could just go in the
[SPEAKER_01]: regular waste if you don't come up with
these solutions to not challenge the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators, but I guess to help inform
them on the knowledge of the plant that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have as industry experts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And on top of that, we also have very
different regulations depending on which
[SPEAKER_07]: product regulatory category we put the
product in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in Switzerland, for example,
where I'm from, cannabis up to a 0.3% if
[SPEAKER_07]: the THC content of up to 1% is not
considered a narcotic drug, that's already
[SPEAKER_07]: not harmonized, because in Europe,
it's 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have other jurisdictions within Europe
that accept up to 0.6%.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's quite a wide area.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I may address something in
Switzerland now that's interesting,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's the first time that the Swiss Medic
and Federal Office of Public Health has
[SPEAKER_07]: put out an information that in the field
of cosmetics regulation, for example,
[SPEAKER_07]: anything that goes up to 1% is not
considered a narcotic drug.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a big issue about whether THC
could be, whether cosmetic products could
[SPEAKER_07]: entail or have a component of THC at all,
because there's a prohibited narcotic
[SPEAKER_07]: regulation in cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now the regulator actually made clear
up to 1% is more or less fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see how that pans out in
enforcement, but that's where we are today
[SPEAKER_07]: in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can just jump in, we have a very
interesting situation in Slovenia with
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like most of European countries up
to 0.3.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the position of our Supreme Court is
that on the list of illicit drugs in
[SPEAKER_02]: Slovenia is cannabis as a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't matter if it's 0.2,
0.3.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you cultivate it, it's a criminal
offense unless you have a license from the
[SPEAKER_02]: Ministry of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have it and you cultivate it,
you cultivate hemp, it's a criminal
[SPEAKER_02]: offense regardless of what the THC level
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, we have the National
Institute of Health who says, no,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, industrial hemp is legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow it, you can do everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not even the regulators and the courts
are on the same page here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes also the regulator just tells
you to sue them because they just can't
[SPEAKER_05]: change the situation by themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the way we have to go via
courts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and as we know, that's something
that's difficult to afford for many
[SPEAKER_07]: companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also it takes a lot, a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the reason we came to this
place in Switzerland is because it's
[SPEAKER_07]: already been three years that also myself
have been litigating these cases.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's three years on that they've
realized that they can't just take the
[SPEAKER_07]: definition of the Single Convention but
actually have to take a specific
[SPEAKER_07]: interpretation into account.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you can speak about your experiences
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: We spoke on a meta level.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we take it a bit more down to a
country level.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your experience in Germany with
those regional differences?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you dive a bit into more detail there?
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends really on the local regulator.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look into Northern Westphalia,
they're pretty open-minded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bavaria as well, even though for the
upcoming recreational market we see that
[SPEAKER_04]: Bavaria will be a hellhole more or less.
[SPEAKER_04]: They already put on an execution of order
allowing people to be fined if they smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: with youngsters, minors I mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the given moment there's no,
let's say a red line in between the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulators.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm assuming it's going to be the same
way for recreational market as well as of
[SPEAKER_04]: the medical market in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no red line.
[SPEAKER_04]: More or less you have to have experience
where you apply for your medical license,
[SPEAKER_04]: import or wholesale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm assuming it's going to be the same
thing for cannabis clubs especially for
[SPEAKER_04]: the production sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you've heard that Mr. Lauterbach,
that's our health minister, he issued a,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what to call it, it's like a
protocol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before the election in the second chamber
in which he said for the CSC, for the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis clubs we represent that pooling
up production sites is not allowed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah that changes a lot in the whole
economic view even though I'm not allowed
[SPEAKER_04]: to say that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a binding order that was issued or
what's the legal nature of that?
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has never been done before.
[SPEAKER_05]: No but maybe I can say something in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we've had this discussion and we have
a couple of members in our industry
[SPEAKER_05]: association who also want to pursue that
model.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we have that limitation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still in the formulation as it said
it's unclear how many clubs can be in one
[SPEAKER_05]: location to not be considered many.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's still there may be some clubs
together in one spot but if too many are
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 or 15 it's unclear so we have to see
how this all rolls out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think like one point that is very
important here to show is that we just
[SPEAKER_05]: have defragmented regulations across the
globe so it is also up to us if we want to
[SPEAKER_05]: have more safety in acting and safety in
how we can make transnational trade.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all need to lobby more for more
harmonized rules and regulations or the
[SPEAKER_05]: thing that you just said with the CBD
cosmetics in Switzerland we have the same
[SPEAKER_05]: issue here where some entrepreneurs from
Hamburg have been facing, they just did
[SPEAKER_05]: regular CBD oil as a cosmetic and they've
been facing charges for narcotics trades.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those kind of things come from the
single convention so I'll stick with my
[SPEAKER_05]: statement that we all need to lobby to get
cannabis out of the single convention
[SPEAKER_05]: because otherwise we'll be stuck with
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah but we do know that's going to be a
long shot and it's going to take many
[SPEAKER_07]: years until this will be implemented.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now there's movement and the
regulators start to get interested in
[SPEAKER_05]: these kind of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to create solutions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before that it was just like cannabis,
no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now all of a sudden this huge massive
economy pops up and there's a willingness
[SPEAKER_05]: to create new regulations or to have
standards for audits.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean that's also potentially a lot of
your work at here talking with the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulators about just explaining how this
is possible, explaining cannabis to them
[SPEAKER_05]: because they have no clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it's actually really shocking like
because I work in so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: markets the whole reason I started the
association is I would just see things
[SPEAKER_01]: that were written in regulations or things
that my clients had to adhere to that just
[SPEAKER_01]: made absolutely no sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know deciding that every five or
fifteen pounds of finished product is its
[SPEAKER_01]: own individual batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to do that but they're
just you know racking up millions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars in testing fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned too even with having
clients in Switzerland wanting to sell CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: into Germany we're doing these really
dangerous chemical wash downs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's making the product garbage to be
honest and they're respraying it with the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene spray and they're pumping it into
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they could just come to an
understanding of the same level of a THC
[SPEAKER_01]: limit for the product to move freely
across even just Europe alone that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to have more of this
international harmonization because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that as an industry we need to come
together and unify a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I move product around the world all the
time and it's always this weird balancing
[SPEAKER_01]: act.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean even when we move product out of
Switzerland that's over 0.6, 0.7 that's
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately a narcotic in other countries
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there needs to be this kind of
assistance I think for the regulators and
[SPEAKER_01]: Lisa's totally right like a lot of them
weren't open to any information really and
[SPEAKER_01]: as countries have come online and a lot of
them have made mistakes or they've kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: made missteps I would say they're now a
lot more open for these conversations in
[SPEAKER_01]: these discussions and saying okay maybe we
don't know what we're doing maybe it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more complex than we thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know where can we get some guidance.
[SPEAKER_07]: We feel the same in Switzerland to be
honest it was a very difficult
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation in the beginning but it's
also understandable because to some extent
[SPEAKER_07]: we're talking about some tension between
illicit markets where operators had to
[SPEAKER_07]: learn to find the path of least resistance
for marketability right and now suddenly
[SPEAKER_07]: markets are opening up but to a very small
degree and in a very complex manner and
[SPEAKER_07]: suddenly you have to take into account
various product regulatory fields like
[SPEAKER_07]: cosmetics regulation, foodstuffs
regulation, chemical regulation,
[SPEAKER_07]: therapeutic product act regulation and
they don't understand the context and they
[SPEAKER_07]: just bring products to market and this
creates a lot of tension and frustration
[SPEAKER_07]: on the side of the authorities and
understandably a little bit an attitude of
[SPEAKER_07]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes Lisa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe also interesting for Switzerland
particularly because you had that CBD and
[SPEAKER_05]: a massive CBD boom yeah and there were all
these producers coming up like offer a
[SPEAKER_05]: sudden as a massive oversupply.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean some of that cannabis definitely
also went into let's say unregulated or
[SPEAKER_05]: even illicit value chains from that
because it was not properly tracked and
[SPEAKER_05]: there were no rules to keep the product in
the legal market so that is definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: something that I think it should be like
on our list of priorities to also build
[SPEAKER_05]: value chains where the product stays in
the value chain and does not migrate
[SPEAKER_05]: anywhere at some point and then you have
other issues popping up through that and
[SPEAKER_05]: then the regulator will be unhappy again
so it's also like that we need to find
[SPEAKER_05]: some solutions and make this more tangible
more traceable and make it like so it's
[SPEAKER_07]: transparent and just to make this a bit
more specific what you're speaking about
[SPEAKER_07]: is actually CBD flower being sold into the
illicit market because CBD flower is
[SPEAKER_07]: relatively cheap versus THC and then it's
simply sprayed with synthetic cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_07]: or even spice and then distributed in the
market and there's a lot of product from
[SPEAKER_07]: Switzerland that actually ends up in the
black market it's not it's an open secret
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's very hard for the conversation
with the regulator can you guys tell me a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit how this how how is this
conversation with the regulator when you
[SPEAKER_07]: speak when you say you meet with the
regulator are the barriers very high do
[SPEAKER_07]: you get the meetings easily how does it
work in Slovenia well in Slovenia it might
[SPEAKER_02]: be a bit easier because we're a small
country so it's kind of easier to get in
[SPEAKER_02]: touch with them and the approach the tweet
took is up until like eight nine months
[SPEAKER_02]: ago the situation was really bad I mean it
was everything was banned and there was no
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding on the side of the regulator
also due to the fact that as we basically
[SPEAKER_02]: all mentioned they didn't know much about
it and so we in September we said okay
[SPEAKER_02]: let's organize a conference actually with
the help of ICBC science and technology
[SPEAKER_02]: and we invited a lot of scientists and a
lot of politicians also the members of the
[SPEAKER_02]: government came and we showed them look
cannabis is not just people smoking on the
[SPEAKER_02]: streets is not just stoneheads it's a
whole industry behind it and not just
[SPEAKER_02]: medical a lot of it and this was kind of
the first step so a couple of months later
[SPEAKER_02]: with the help of the Cancer Patient
Society we organized an event in our
[SPEAKER_02]: National Assembly or now in the National
Council and it helped would just be like
[SPEAKER_07]: the Bundesrat yeah I know Alex shared a
few of those pictures on LinkedIn so yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah it's great and it was I mean even for
me it was in bit surprising that in such
[SPEAKER_02]: short few months we managed to get
basically to the Parliament and it helped
[SPEAKER_02]: and now they're willing to listen and I'm
having I'm having a meeting next week with
[SPEAKER_02]: with the government to talk about a new
bill and everything so things are moving
[SPEAKER_02]: forward and as I said we took the approach
of showing them what cannabis can be so I
[SPEAKER_07]: think this is a very interesting framework
and maybe it can be implanted in other
[SPEAKER_07]: jurisdictions in Switzerland I feel and in
other European countries the regulators
[SPEAKER_07]: have understood that the the current
framework of narcotics regulation has
[SPEAKER_07]: failed and and even addiction
organizations and so on are all advocating
[SPEAKER_07]: for an opening of the market for other
frameworks so our experience is also
[SPEAKER_07]: they're very happy to listen and we have
the pilot projects now going on what I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: interested in because we don't have much
time left and I want to leave some time
[SPEAKER_07]: for a few questions as well Atia you're in
one of the most you live in Thailand now
[SPEAKER_07]: which is an interesting market I've been
there recently and it's cannabis is just
[SPEAKER_07]: omnipresent it's an absolute madness maybe
you can give us a little bit of insights
[SPEAKER_07]: from your experiences what's happening
there yeah I mean I actually moved
[SPEAKER_01]: Thailand to Thailand specifically from
Canada because I had been kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: splitting my time between Canada and
Europe for the past few years what
[SPEAKER_01]: Thailand has done no other country will
ever do again that no other country will
[SPEAKER_01]: say just do whatever you want and we'll
see what happens for cannabis so I wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to go down and kind of see it up close and
personal and it is it's quite wild there's
[SPEAKER_01]: 6,000 dispensaries there's no enforcement
no one's really coming around the products
[SPEAKER_01]: that they they do have a small law saying
are illegal are all available in the
[SPEAKER_01]: stores there's no supply chain tracking
there's no traceability so there are a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of really fantastic operators especially
the clients that I work with that are
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing forward and they're doing a lot of
self-regulation and they're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: export of course so they're trying to
adhere to international standards or get
[SPEAKER_01]: GMP or at least GACP so there's people
there that are you know making those
[SPEAKER_01]: changes themselves but the government's
really lagged behind on that and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not really well informed on what they need
to do so they're now trying to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: reverse a little bit and so what we've
heard is that they want to basically make
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational no longer allowed and switch
to medical now when we say switch to
[SPEAKER_01]: medical I mean I think the maybe a few
months ago that news came out everyone was
[SPEAKER_01]: like are you moving out of Thailand like
are you leaving everybody on the ground is
[SPEAKER_01]: just still working nobody has stopped
everyone's expanding their facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's continuing it's a huge revenue
stream no government really tends to say
[SPEAKER_07]: but you know fine get rid of the revenue
so is cannabis taxed is there taxes not as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as it should be because they don't
have supply chain traceability right so
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't really know how much each
producer is making they don't really know
[SPEAKER_01]: how much is going into different areas so
I think they do taxing on something but
[SPEAKER_05]: not enough from the INCB requirements also
they should need that need to know that
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah or isn't that like a requirement sir
what say that you document how much
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis you're producing for the
International Narcotics Control Board yes
[SPEAKER_07]: you're supposed to look we've seen in
Canada you're we've seen the world doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: end if you don't comply I'm determined for
that also yeah yeah maybe we need more
[SPEAKER_07]: chutzpah we call it right to actually go
and do some and push the barriers I think
[SPEAKER_07]: we have a few minutes left maybe we can
take some questions from the audience
[SPEAKER_06]: thank you I'm Martin from from SGS we are
a testing house so I have a question as I
[SPEAKER_06]: understand the senior convention of
narcotic drugs is a major issue for for
[SPEAKER_06]: developing the future business of cannabis
worldwide so and I understand that two
[SPEAKER_06]: countries in the world legalize cannabis
already like Canada or Uruguay do we have
[SPEAKER_06]: any issue do you ever heard that there's a
criminal proceedings happens against these
[SPEAKER_06]: countries because they actively work
against the UN single convention and if
[SPEAKER_06]: Switzerland has these triads in the moment
and if Switzerland could be the next
[SPEAKER_06]: country to make it legalized so you will
be third country if you legalize it
[SPEAKER_06]: completely like Canada or Uruguay so you
will be the third country maybe or what I
[SPEAKER_06]: heard yesterday Czech Republic or in means
also that you're more and more countries
[SPEAKER_06]: going in this direction so would this be a
nice open discussion point to discuss with
[SPEAKER_06]: authorities worldwide to think about the
change of the UN senior convention of
[SPEAKER_07]: narcotic drugs anyone wants to answer that
one I mean you're the lawyer yeah so but
[SPEAKER_07]: well there's there hasn't been any
enforcement really warning letters I think
[SPEAKER_05]: they have been sorry warning letters
warning letters and warning letter also
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah but the UN warning letters yeah but
the UN can't find anyone it can can't find
[SPEAKER_04]: a country baiting out or breaking the the
UN Convention and warning letters are
[SPEAKER_05]: sweet yeah but as Gaspas said before like
the bigger risk here in Europe is to get
[SPEAKER_05]: like fines for breaching European law and
it's not necessarily the single convention
[SPEAKER_05]: but nevertheless it's the law that is
governing many of our processes so it
[SPEAKER_05]: needs to be it's something that needs to
be changed that may be through interstate
[SPEAKER_05]: modification but again also these are like
these processes take time but in best case
[SPEAKER_05]: we should all keep on lobbying to remove
cannabis from the single convention so the
[SPEAKER_04]: legal pressure come from Brussels but we
can yeah we can neglect New York but the
[SPEAKER_04]: pressure comes from from Brussels they can
find the countries they can find them big
[SPEAKER_07]: time and nevertheless there's still some
gaps in interpretation also in scholarly
[SPEAKER_07]: writings as to how far does the single
convention go is very blunt here it's two
[SPEAKER_05]: countries who are keeping us in the single
convention and cannabis China and Russia
[SPEAKER_05]: correct yeah so yeah as long as that is
not changing and as long as there is no
[SPEAKER_05]: movement there so that's will be blockage
more questions maybe maybe I can is there
[SPEAKER_00]: oh sorry thank you with the global markets
opening up do you think it's possible that
[SPEAKER_00]: countries signed on to the UN single
convention to be forced to withdraw from
[SPEAKER_00]: the treaty if the voters of those
respective countries applied specific
[SPEAKER_07]: political pressure there is various ways
on how you could potentially circumvent
[SPEAKER_07]: the problems that you have with the single
convention getting out of the single
[SPEAKER_07]: convention obviously is very challenging
because it does not only affect cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: it affects all kinds of medicines and and
and medical products so it this is not
[SPEAKER_07]: really there's been discussions in Germany
maybe getting out of the single convention
[SPEAKER_07]: and then reentering after with an
exception that's a possibility there's
[SPEAKER_07]: possibilities to do intersame
modifications between various countries
[SPEAKER_07]: but that's a conversation honestly for a
whole different panel or five panels there
[SPEAKER_07]: are potential options but they're all very
challenging and the interest to really get
[SPEAKER_07]: out of the single convention is very low
and I don't think that's a very realistic
[SPEAKER_07]: scenario it's rather breach it and and
live with the warning letters so maybe I
[SPEAKER_03]: can add a question if there's no more
question what's about the believing
[SPEAKER_03]: approach when believer legal they re
legalized the coca plant and they left the
[SPEAKER_03]: single convention and reentered and that
worked out in that case so is that not
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be would that be a solution for
Germany that's an interesting question
[SPEAKER_05]: actually Micha because that's for the
traditional use of coca yeah and that is
[SPEAKER_05]: also something that is super interesting
for global national national trade we have
[SPEAKER_05]: some countries of original origin for
traditional cannabis products like for
[SPEAKER_05]: example Moroccan hash yeah so that is a
typical traditional product made of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis and the coca regulation that
Micha mentions they are really for the
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional use in the culture I would
like to answer also I think it is a viable
[SPEAKER_07]: potential Avenue because it's unlikely
that if Germany would really take the step
[SPEAKER_07]: and get out of the convention that they
would be let back in just because they're
[SPEAKER_07]: actually bracketing out cannabis from from
the nerd codex list thank you if we have
[SPEAKER_07]: no further questions well I would like to
thank the panel for this conversation
[SPEAKER_07]: could obviously as have been much longer
and we're still around if you have any
[SPEAKER_07]: questions so thank you very much guys
let's hear it again very informative thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you thank you very much
