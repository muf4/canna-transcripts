[SPEAKER_05]: David, Joel in the middle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is all, I think we've migrated.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got David Wenger, Henry Ball at the
end, and we've got Joel Sherlock in the
[SPEAKER_05]: middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gentlemen, just give them a quick outline
of yourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about everyone still awake after
lunch?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm David Wenger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the Chief Global Initiatives Officer
for the Vang Corporation.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the keynote sponsors of the event.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope everybody has a chance to come to
our party tonight at the Space Monkey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been investing in the industry,
cannabis industry, since 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started investing in Canada and then
invested in the United States early on in
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the now leading multi-state
operating operators.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently, I started shifting some of my
investment focus from multi-state cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: operators to brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the companies that I invested in is
Vang, and I've gotten to know the team
[SPEAKER_03]: more and more, and now I'm joined by David
Wenger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Joel in the middle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my name is Joel Sherlock.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been invested, starting on the
private equity side in the Canadian space
[SPEAKER_06]: since 2011.
[SPEAKER_06]: Started as very generalists and weren't a
lot of the big names very early on,
[SPEAKER_06]: so it's been a good market to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had a focus in the US for the last
couple of years and now really focused on
[SPEAKER_06]: European opportunities here and really
narrowed down our scope into our
[SPEAKER_06]: investment ecosystem, if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my name is Henry Gohl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working from Frankfurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We control a small family office.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have not invested into CBDs
and cannabis companies yet, but the main
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why I'm here is to look at
opportunities and potential for such
[SPEAKER_00]: companies in the next one or two years,
but I could also make a very short term
[SPEAKER_00]: investment if there are some interesting
deals right along here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys see we've got a really diverse
group on the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Investors basically rooted in Europe,
Canada, and the US, but all of them
[SPEAKER_05]: investing globally.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where the market is right now.
And all of them touching both private and
public companies.
So really interesting viewpoints.
Jumping right in, as we sit in
Switzerland, some of the other panels
discuss the differences with the view and
the flexibility that actually lends to
[SPEAKER_05]: Swiss, but really jumping in, what are the
primary differences in raising funds right
[SPEAKER_05]: now in Europe versus North America?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me start with Joel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our first funds were mainly backed by our
capital and then Canadians, but most of
[SPEAKER_06]: our experience in the public markets in
the early days was actually selling things
[SPEAKER_06]: that we deal to publicly traded companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: The biggest difference I see when you look
at the aim or the next or some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: markets over here, the barrier to entry
and just the diligence required over here
[SPEAKER_06]: is quite a bit higher than maybe the
venture or the CSE and the Canadian
[SPEAKER_06]: landscape where most of the cannabis
companies sit now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there'll be a lot more questions,
a lot more diligence, and a lot more
[SPEAKER_06]: requirements just around reporting,
business plans, kind of basically all the
[SPEAKER_06]: things we should have in Canada sometimes
that is actually more mature from the
[SPEAKER_03]: point of view.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think the maturity aspect is very
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think looking at where the US was a
couple of years ago as an investor,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a pretty fragmented landscape and
you weren't quite sure how the business
[SPEAKER_03]: would perform and a lot of the companies
raising money were not very professional.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's become much more professional.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in Europe, looking here,
looking around, there's a sense that a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of the operators here are bringing up very
high level of professionals and right from
[SPEAKER_03]: the get-go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that also looking at this market
from a US operator's perspective and
[SPEAKER_03]: investor's perspective, we've seen now
twice what has happened in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industries in Canada and the United States
going from some talk and building that
[SPEAKER_03]: talk building up to a ground level of
support to an industry built.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that looking at the Europe
market, there's no question that same
[SPEAKER_03]: thing is going to happen here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So investors are going to be looking at
this market with a certain degree of
[SPEAKER_03]: patience and they're also bringing capital
that has already been made in other
[SPEAKER_03]: markets from cannabis activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a degree of confidence that
companies and operators and investors are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to have looking at the market here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it bodes very well for
operators here looking to raise money and
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for partners and also for
investors looking for opportunities here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just add that I see the potential
of CBD right now as the 2000 investment
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity where we had the bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now in Europe, we are still very
premature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the US companies or
some interesting CBD companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: they start from the seed all the way down
to the selling of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would rather invest in a US kind of
deal where they grow seeds in whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: state, I don't want to name any,
compared to some European countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely Syria.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me take a quick poll here.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD seems to be a pretty hot topic here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are all operators or investors in
the sector.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who here operates a business or investment
industry?
[SPEAKER_05]: A business that is THC only?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hands?
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And CBD only?
[SPEAKER_05]: THC and CBD?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's segue into a question right now
about investing in CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Henry started us off.
[SPEAKER_05]: David, you've obviously made not just an
investment, but you're also putting in
[SPEAKER_05]: additional resources, your mind shift into
essentially CBD by way of your investment
[SPEAKER_05]: in bank and others.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your take right now on CBD
relativity or other investments in the
[SPEAKER_05]: space?
[SPEAKER_03]: I view CBD to be one aspect of the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the cannabis plant is where
the vast, the work worth of potential is
[SPEAKER_03]: before this industry is the whole plant
and all the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that THC is a big,
big part of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have to of course deal with the
radiatory realities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that CBD is available now and
there is a quicker radiatory pathway to
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD being one aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's where the market is falling
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But from a personal perspective,
I think that the demand for THC is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually underestimated as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I'm talking about necessarily
high THC of people getting stoned,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there is something to being home in
the afternoon of your house life and
[SPEAKER_03]: cleaning up the laundry or have a husband
and have a little bit of THC to make it
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we're not talking about getting
stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that this whole plant offers a
lot of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a personal take on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two ancillary businesses that work
synergistically together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the farm bill rocked our world.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gave us a much bigger, for instance,
with Bud.com instead of delivering in
[SPEAKER_05]: California and then going and setting up
partners and framework in Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_05]: and then doing that in Florida,
in the states that allow those fragmented
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we can go ahead and ship CBD next day
or basically globally.
[SPEAKER_05]: It upped our addressable market
immeasurably.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when over 99% of the people go to our
site, Bud.com, I generally can't deliver
[SPEAKER_05]: them to cannabis unless they live in these
parts of California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so all of a sudden it's changed the
game.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of companies for whom this
has happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, as a professional investor,
Joel, what do you see with CBD?
[SPEAKER_06]: As a professional investor, I'm always
focused on managing downside risk.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like if everything goes well,
we make a profit, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what happens when it doesn't go well?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so from a cultivation standpoint with
THC, I was never pro-cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have jurisdictional risk.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're limited to one state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you buy a license in Washington and
look at the pricing in Washington,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can't do anything else with that
license.
[SPEAKER_06]: So CBD has a whole lot of really
interesting opportunities simply because
[SPEAKER_06]: you can cultivate it here, make a brand
here, and then ship it in a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: different areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our focus has now been things that
don't have that kind of jurisdictional
[SPEAKER_06]: risk.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, from equipment companies that
manufacture machines to, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have an ethanol company.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the companies I started called
Vitalis, which manufactures extraction
[SPEAKER_06]: machines.
[SPEAKER_06]: We make those in Canada and ship them all
over the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that's really been a big
important part of our thesis is just not
[SPEAKER_06]: having that jurisdictional risk,
which is exciting to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Joel, one of your big plays is a
hardware manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, so it's extraction equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: What percentage of that equipment do you
think is being used to extract CBD?
[SPEAKER_06]: A huge amount of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the interesting part for us is we
used to buy extraction equipment and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we had this machine over here
and a different one over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I just fundamentally
believe that if you're investing in
[SPEAKER_06]: brands, you need the same extraction
methodology.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there needs to be consistency of
that brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when you go to a Starbucks or
McDonald's, it's the same espresso
[SPEAKER_06]: machine, the same cash register,
you know, it's consistency of that
[SPEAKER_06]: experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you get a license to brew
Budweiser, they don't tell you to just go
[SPEAKER_06]: out and buy whatever equipment you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's exactly what they need so that it's
the same in every market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, when we started Vitalis,
it was just so that we had a standardized
[SPEAKER_06]: platform for everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we started making really big
equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, we started making that for the
CBD markets, but now we're starting to see
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, CO2 extraction machines that are
a whole facility that can do multiple tons
[SPEAKER_06]: a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that's been an incredible
pace.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just in the scale of some of these
facilities and the amount of biomass that
[SPEAKER_06]: they can get through.
Well, I think that speaks to the fact that
CBD is just thriving on this volume we
wrote.
It just flat out is.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also run a hardware business where we
make pre-rolls for the patent tech that
does that and the scale to which right now
our festival market is grown for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wouldn't have built those CO2
machines without CBD driving that,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's definitely the volume.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the other interesting thing is what CBD
has done is it's brought folks in that
[SPEAKER_05]: were averse to THC for whatever reason,
regulatory, because part of the
[SPEAKER_05]: psychoactive work with their models.
[SPEAKER_05]: But an investor like Henry, who has
invested broadly in different verticals,
[SPEAKER_05]: now finds himself in this room because of
CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to add that I am from a
medical doctor and I never really liked
[SPEAKER_00]: the toxic part of the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have a non-toxic product
available which can be used in multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have approached by one of our
own energy drinks that people months ago
[SPEAKER_00]: or half a year ago asked if we had a
problem to put CBD in the drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we got aware of,
wow, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So moving past the sort of CBD,
it's gotten so big, but it's only one
[SPEAKER_05]: component of this space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And generally when we talk about CBD,
just like when we talk about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: it still breaks out is it hardware,
is it software, is it flowers,
[SPEAKER_05]: is it cultivation, is it packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now the question to investors on
the panel is narrowing down what are the
[SPEAKER_05]: types of verticals, what products,
what within the space is right now sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: most lucrative and what looks best or
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my perspective on investing in this
industry is that there's so much white
[SPEAKER_03]: space and so much opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this doesn't only go for investors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes for operators, for anybody
watching the business.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much opportunity all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in order to succeed, you need to have
a measure of focus on whether it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain area that you're focused in or a
certain market or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have a lane because if you're
just looking for the next opportunity,
[SPEAKER_03]: it is just too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way I've looked at it is I've tried
to become an expert in companies that make
[SPEAKER_03]: and sell cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't really look at any of the
other ancillary verticals, not that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's not a lot of opportunities there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course there are, but I focused in that
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And within that particular area,
at least in the U.S., I've seen a trend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote a white paper in September of
2018, and I spoke about this in Berlin
[SPEAKER_03]: called the Green Radiatory Arbitrage,
a case for investing in U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: multistate vertically integrated cannabis
companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that set out the history of where I
think prohibition, where I think
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization is headed, and my thesis for
investing in at the time, multistate
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis operators.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those are still great investment
opportunities in the United States,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think that brands in the United
States are where the real, real winners
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: The multistate operators, some of them are
going to develop brands, but the reason
[SPEAKER_03]: why lately my personal investment focus
has turned to brands and why I've joined
[SPEAKER_03]: banks to help them with global initiatives
is because this is a CPG industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody really, really cares where it was
grown or who grows it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some kind of source might, but most people
don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are buying a product,
a CPG finished product, and they want it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And many times from a credible brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bang is one of the first cannabis
companies in the United States founded in
[SPEAKER_03]: 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: The company has navigated all of the
challenges of existing in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry for 10 years to go
public in the next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if you're looking at
investment opportunities, look for brands
[SPEAKER_03]: that have traction, that have stood the
test of time, and have the potential to
[SPEAKER_03]: become, in the case of the U.S.,
national brands, or as our ambitions are,
[SPEAKER_03]: to be a global brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So CPGs, brands, manufacturers,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Joel's got a different strategy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also it should be noted that brands
are, right now I think it's a little
[SPEAKER_05]: prohibitive in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: Non-existent?
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that, one would say.
[SPEAKER_06]: First and foremost for us is always
people, the management team is the first
[SPEAKER_06]: thing we look at.
[SPEAKER_06]: But ultimately, whether you're looking to
make an investment or if you're looking to
[SPEAKER_06]: receive investment, look on the other side
of just the cash.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else can you bring to the table?
[SPEAKER_06]: What else does that company need?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have the right people to actually
execute the strategy?
[SPEAKER_06]: In the early days of Canada, it was like,
oh, we have a license, and then the values
[SPEAKER_06]: would go up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's come to a grinding hold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you actually have to be able to
execute a business plan and make that
[SPEAKER_06]: important stuff called profit.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the Canadian companies forgot to
do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for us, it's always about if we're
negotiating on a deal, and the
[SPEAKER_06]: infrastructure that we already have can
really help the company.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're investing in our money's not the
same color.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can make the investment, we can get the
operating capital, but we can also provide
[SPEAKER_06]: them with, be it our global network of
supply people on the equipment side,
[SPEAKER_06]: if it's another equipment company,
or if it was a brand, if we can introduce
[SPEAKER_06]: them to our licensed processors who all
have the same machine, we can invest in a
[SPEAKER_06]: brand, introduce them to our clients,
and globally get them into legal markets
[SPEAKER_06]: with partners who all have the same
extraction machine, here are the SOPs,
[SPEAKER_06]: and that gives the brand an unfair
advantage.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's good for the brand, it's good for
our investment, and it's also good for the
[SPEAKER_06]: people who own our machines.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's full transparency.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is a win-win-win.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it makes us a very good partner for
what we call our ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's really what we're focused on
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super important to focus, just to focus,
I think the overarching, if you talk to
[SPEAKER_05]: investors, there is so much out there that
you can't really dive in and understand a
[SPEAKER_05]: space or a level if you're not entrenched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of you have some insight there?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I totally agree with what the two
gentlemen said before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just in the learning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very excited about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the new opportunity here for the
CBD investment, but I agree to what
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else said before, so that's the
thing that I can add.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be focusing on CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, not with all the cash,
but I would definitely consider an
[SPEAKER_00]: investment role.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sort of back real quick on CBD,
but touching on the regulatory component,
[SPEAKER_05]: just because David, sitting here,
has some very interesting color,
[SPEAKER_05]: working essentially with Senate
committees.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love for you to sort of share some of
what you see, because that will absolutely
[SPEAKER_05]: impact the investment landscape.
Right now, it's a big open question.
What are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And please also describe what task you're
working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the white paper that I mentioned
before, which was published on new
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis ventures, was read across the
world and also in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congress and got me invited to join the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Senate Cannabis Working Group and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: House Cannabis Working Group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm in D.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: twice a month in these two working groups,
which are members of their congressional
[SPEAKER_03]: staffers working on drafting and crafting
federal cannabis legislation and trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: get more support for it in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congress.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we worked through a whole bunch of
issues on the cannabis side, on the PhD
[SPEAKER_03]: and CBD side.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably speaking from the
legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I very much agree with Congressman
Roragreker's view this morning,
[SPEAKER_03]: and frankly, the whole industry worldwide
owes a debt of gratitude to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Roragreker FAR amendment is a single
most important piece of cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: legislation here in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I agree with him that it's moving
forward quickly in Congress.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot, a lot of activity behind
the scenes in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congress.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Safe Banking Act is very likely,
it appears, going to pass, I think it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: happen this summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's gonna advance the industry
very, very significantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: When banks like J.P.
[SPEAKER_03]: Martin, Bank of America, Seabank are
banking the industry, it's gonna become
[SPEAKER_03]: normalized quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the CBD side, at a recent meeting,
there was a discussion that Mitch
[SPEAKER_03]: McConnell, who is the second most powerful
person in the United States after the
[SPEAKER_03]: president of the Senate majority leader,
he was largely responsible for getting the
[SPEAKER_03]: Farm Bill passed at the end of 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Farm Bill removed him from the
TSA.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no longer a drug, it's now
agricultural.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mitch McConnell used, Senator McConnell
used a lot of his political capital and a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of his key supporters in Kentucky were
pushing to get the Farm Bill leaked in
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he got it done, a monumental
accomplishment in the Congress.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now, the FDA has effectively put a
brake sign and said, no, you can't put CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: in food.
[SPEAKER_03]: The claims, of course, they need to police
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't market ourselves as a dietary
supplement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've started an industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this massive demand and the FDA
has stepped in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Congress, I think, is frustrated
with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not happy with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the FDA has said things like,
as indicated, that they want Congress to
[SPEAKER_03]: legislate some more about hemp,
about how CBD can be active food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Congress's perspective is
that, no, you, FDA, are an agency charged
[SPEAKER_03]: with doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the messaging that it should take four
years is unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the FDA regulates drugs and alcohol,
which kill people every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are sold every single day.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD is, at worst, not helpful,
at worst.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at the upside and the
downside of it, the downside versus the
[SPEAKER_03]: upside, the FDA should be able to,
within, I'd say, six months, figure out
[SPEAKER_03]: how this can be brought to market in a
sensible way with dosage, medications,
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're not dealing with something
that's dangerous here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Congress is actively looking at forcing
the FDA to move forward quickly,
[SPEAKER_03]: including through appropriations measures
and other measures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that don't be too pessimistic
about the progress of CBD in food in the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there's going to be progress
there soon, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree with 100% of what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the logic there is undeniable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those barriers have created a ton of
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's certainly things that you have to
watch out for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's state by state, or the
different rules in Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_06]: to Denmark, to wherever, around potencies
of CBD, potencies of THC, different
[SPEAKER_06]: allowable limits, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's great opportunity,
if you know how to navigate that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, as soon as safe banking comes in
and foreign bills totally clear down,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's also going to bring in a whole lot
more competition, both on the capital
[SPEAKER_06]: side, but also on the production side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once there's lending and people can
build much bigger farms and get mortgage
[SPEAKER_06]: rates, and you're not having to go out and
work as hard as everyone in this room has
[SPEAKER_06]: worked to build the businesses that they
have, there's a whole lot more scale,
[SPEAKER_06]: a whole lot more production, which is
going to drive prices down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a great opportunity right now,
but you still have to make sure that
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a plan for the price compression
that is coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: So no doubt, I'll say as an operator,
clearly having just more readily access to
[SPEAKER_05]: the big banks, as far as funding is one
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for us, having a business with 120
employees that are paid out in cash weekly
[SPEAKER_05]: is asinine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's beyond asinine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a person that counts money.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that person's job.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the efficiencies that are going to
come from that, my friend, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_05]: even sort of put into words.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're just, it's rough operating
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it will smooth things,
not just with access to capital,
[SPEAKER_05]: but man, like normalize operations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the crazy thing in California,
where we're the fifth largest economy in
[SPEAKER_05]: the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're the largest cannabis market in the
world and get bank accounts closed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now our industry is hiring more
than any other industry in our state,
[SPEAKER_05]: no doubt.
[SPEAKER_05]: So interesting things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think in all of them, absolutely
opportunity wise.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know where we're at,
but generally this is a panel that elicits
[SPEAKER_05]: tons of questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to go ahead and take it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for sharing your experience there.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Graham Debar.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm from Ireland, which is like a
cryptocurrency payment system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So would you be looking towards
cryptocurrency as an alternative method of
[SPEAKER_07]: having a diversified asset class in your
companies?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's been looked at a lot,
obviously, because of out of necessity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's sort of an option.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of folks have taken the view
that two negatives don't make a positive.
We're already sort of in a difficult
industry.
And so now sort of poking the barrier a
little bit more and saying, hey,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're going to use this sort of off the
charts method of taking in our funds.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because the bigger players don't
think that potentially it's a great look
[SPEAKER_05]: for the regulators right now that we're
trying to convince to let us pay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you guys have any insight onto that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I've been asked that question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've taken a look at a ton of them
from PopPay, GreenCoin, a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: If someone could bring me a paper that
basically would like the KYC side of this
[SPEAKER_06]: E &T money laundering approval,
that this would be OK to process cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: payments that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in all day long.
[SPEAKER_06]: It solves a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's been able to prove that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm with you there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two wrongs don't make a right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an interesting solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't think it's quite there yet for
me personally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any solutions to get a look right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that's where long term folks
are sort of holding, because we think that
[SPEAKER_05]: things are coming in the summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: For Microsoft, I agree with everything
that's been said.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that blockchain in the cannabis
industry is interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: IBM is doing a partnership with a company
called Wasabi to build blockchain to cover
[SPEAKER_03]: the entire Canadian cannabis industry now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any time that I see crypto in a cannabis
deck, I usually stop reading.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because there's anything wrong with
crypto, but just to the point that he
[SPEAKER_03]: made, I think it's too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a leap too far to take both of these
leaps in one shot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there other questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's got to be more questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a question?
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably have a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about this crypto thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it work in general, crypto?
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that's not totally accurate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it does work.
[SPEAKER_03]: The difference between crypto and cannabis
is that cannabis is very easy to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand, and the demand is proven for
those two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are two things that we don't have
with crypto.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't actually have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just also wanted to mention the cut down
on costs that you were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier with counting money and also the
fact that you need right now armored
[SPEAKER_01]: vehicles to move your cash flow rather
than on the banking system.
[SPEAKER_05]: The nuance sucks, but what's worse is
you're risking lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: People will be killed.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Oakland, which is a huge cannabis hub
in California, the crime is a big issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had our facility broken into.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of our neighbors, most big brands in
California deal with this, and it's no
[SPEAKER_05]: fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just about the nuisance.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about putting our friends and
employees in danger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Related to that is that you walk into a
dispensary and there's security and guns
[SPEAKER_03]: and cameras and it's all because it's
driven by you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, lucky people do though.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could lobby the federal government,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state banking act is going to resolve
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that this time next year
we're going to be having the same
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why even companies in the cannabis
space that are, I think, the closest to
[SPEAKER_03]: this issue that have been processing
payments for cannabis companies are really
[SPEAKER_03]: ramping down their operations.
[SPEAKER_03]: In anticipation of having regular banks
get involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a point earlier, we did one of
the questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about the biggest differences in
the US and Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the maturity and the fact
that you come out without this sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: prevalent market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously there are pockets in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The culture is there, but the business is
growing up basically like ground up legal
insurance.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were a lot of deals that we looked
at in the US which would have been
[SPEAKER_06]: fantastic investments, but for me to jump
on a plane and go and pick up a hockey bag
[SPEAKER_06]: every month is just not an option.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to pass on them.
[SPEAKER_06]: The track record that was talked about,
the European landscape is going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: The borderless nature of the EU is very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so much opportunity here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say that I think
another compelling part for the government
[SPEAKER_01]: to sign on to the Safe Banking Act is also
the aspect of money laundering and how
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with cash facilitates it more
easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: The funky thing is that someone used funky
earlier as a German word.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a German word.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are different components to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually the connotations with cash are
like, hey, it's cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to stop it away.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not true though in our case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is run through track and trace
and through our books.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the benefits of cash money are not
there in this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally just a nuance of carrying
fucking bags with you places and to pay
[SPEAKER_05]: our taxes with bags of cash, our excise
taxes, hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just make one more point about the
point from before.
[SPEAKER_03]: As the FDA looks at companies and looks at
this more closely, and I think for sure
[SPEAKER_03]: the same thing will happen in Europe,
the companies that won't be targets for
[SPEAKER_03]: the FDA and will succeed in the industry
are ones that follow meticulous QA
[SPEAKER_03]: standards and have detailed labels and dot
all the I's, cross all the T's,
[SPEAKER_03]: follow all the rules to a T, and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: we have GRAS publications.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would encourage anyone in this space
looking at the food category, just in
[SPEAKER_03]: general, being meticulous about all the
things that you think you should be
[SPEAKER_03]: meticulous about because it will be to
your advantage as this industry becomes
[SPEAKER_03]: more and more regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just say one thing to that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that what we're seeing,
we've seen it in Canada with a company
[SPEAKER_03]: like Chronos.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen it in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: with other companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Companies that are able to navigate this
regulatory landscape and comply with it
[SPEAKER_03]: are the ones that succeed, and otherwise
you just can't succeed in California over
[SPEAKER_03]: and over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just important to be very attuned
to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A company like ours has done this for a
decade.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very well suited to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen all the shifts, but we'd be
careful to hedge back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you need to do to be able to
stomach investing in a company that right
[SPEAKER_05]: now has all these sort of regulatory
issues?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the guy that liked CPGs,
so these are all plant-touching.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was that process like?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that if you look at any
investment, any investment is a balance of
[SPEAKER_03]: risk versus reward.
[SPEAKER_03]: On one side, there's risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other side, there's reward.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the reward side of this industry and of
cannabis products is known.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all here in this room because we
know that the demand for this product is
[SPEAKER_03]: massive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's underreported, and it's going to be a
tremendous one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a regular, normal-weight product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at the reward is known.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the risk side, I think the illegality
is what the risk is, and it's not,
[SPEAKER_03]: in my view, a real risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a question of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no question.
[SPEAKER_03]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: will decriminalize, reschedule,
legalize cannabis butter with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no question about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in my view, there's no question about
it in Germany and Switzerland and places
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because once we do it, the single
convention will have to be revised,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're the ones who cause this mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we dig ourselves out of the mess
that prohibition has been, the rest of the
[SPEAKER_03]: world, I think, will follow suit over
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that the perceived risk of
investing in cannabis products is large,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's not an actual risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the title of my white paper,
The Greening Radiotory Arbitrage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an arbitrage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mismatch in value because of this
artificial fear that's been created.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this fear is where there's lots and
lots of money to be made.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we're running out of time,
but is the fear really artificial?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, people go to jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: People go to prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there hasn't been a wave in the
United States since 2016.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, maybe not a federal raid,
but there's still states.
[SPEAKER_03]: There hasn't been a federal raid or
seizure on a cannabis company since the
[SPEAKER_03]: end of 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone knows of an instance,
please call me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not federal, but there
definitely have been raids.
[SPEAKER_05]: But look, I think the point being here is,
I think you went in and you assessed,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the risk relative to the reward,
and clearly, you made your decision.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an investor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've invested a lot of my own money into
my businesses, and we saw the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please don't see me as a complainer
about bags of cash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just talking about that as it's a
nuance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously, there are efficiencies to
be gained.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's an amazing market in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually make profit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been selling a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, on that note.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
