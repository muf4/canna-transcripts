[SPEAKER_05]: To discuss novel food in the EU,
we've assembled an expert panel,
[SPEAKER_05]: and to moderate that panel for us,
the Director of Regulatory Solutions at
[SPEAKER_05]: Lawrence Stevens, please welcome Ricardo
Giala!
[SPEAKER_01]: So, morning everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just wait until the last people to
leave the room as they carry on their
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations about cultivation in
Germany, which I'm sure from sitting on
[SPEAKER_01]: that, it's still early days, even though
the law has just changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think probably licensing is only 24
months away.
[SPEAKER_01]: From really actually seeing someone grow
something in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Peter's in the audience, maybe he can
advise you on that when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, thanks for joining us today,
this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about novel foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still very much novel when it comes
to CBD in the UK and in Europe and Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm pleased to introduce Sita
Schulberg, a lawyer and investor with many
[SPEAKER_01]: years of experience in pharma and biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being in the cannabis industry since
2016, if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And founded the European Medical Cannabis
Association in Brussels in 2019,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm sure she'll discuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to my far left there, Constant Ma,
who's joined us all the way from Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: and has trained as a food scientist and
has been in the industry for about 15
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're very, very much pleased to have
him on the panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then myself, as a lawyer, I was
introduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a partner of a law firm, but director
of our regulatory solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a lawyer for about 17 now plus
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in the cannabis industry for
about four and have advised clients in
[SPEAKER_01]: both the medicinal and the CBD and
wellness space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not recreational yet because the UK is not
like Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can't discuss those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise I'll get in trouble with the
authorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Sita, what's on our plate in Europe
when it comes to cannabinoids or anything?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think the situation is very,
very mixed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know the audience is a little bit
maybe more recreational.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I received all the
congratulations like weeks ago about the
[SPEAKER_06]: development, I was a little bit astonished
because I thought, OK, what for exactly?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sitting here also as an industry
representative for the industry is pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: nothing in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought like, wow, OK, there's some
association.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are nonprofit, no profit,
no loss, no taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, this is a way to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we will see how it will develop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also the budgets of such kind of an
association, OK, you can make your easy
[SPEAKER_06]: math.
[SPEAKER_06]: 500 people, let me say 500 euro membership
fee.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are 250,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anybody who even run a charity
organization, as also I do, 250,000 is not
[SPEAKER_06]: much money if you have also to grow and to
have people engaged for the growing,
[SPEAKER_06]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will see the development how this
will go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So of course, the other option was,
OK, it's maybe something in the novel food
[SPEAKER_06]: area.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it the food area?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we see through Europe that edibles
are tolerated.
[SPEAKER_06]: This does not mean that they are
legalized.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they are tolerated in several
countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, you don't know how things
are going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we know that CBD is, of course,
under the focus already of the EFSA.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that there were about 150
applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: 19 remained.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm really not an authority batter.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you see the movement of EFSA and
the time they need to evaluate something,
[SPEAKER_06]: it is pretty painful.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have even probiotics still in
evaluation, which we already know,
[SPEAKER_06]: since Danone and Nestle, that this is
something which is favorable for your
[SPEAKER_06]: well-being and your microbiome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And still, we do not have an assessment
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is why my hope to have for CBD a
quick reach is not very optimistic.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think another situation which is,
of course, developing is the ban of being
[SPEAKER_06]: a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this is a very interesting
approach, because it was a political,
[SPEAKER_06]: not a pharmacological decision.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know it all.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you have food and you have,
until now, the barrier that you cannot mix
[SPEAKER_06]: it with a narcotic, which was OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody understood.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is now not a narcotic anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I will be very interested in the
legal argumentation of the authorities how
[SPEAKER_06]: to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the Food Administration authority
has presently refused cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: of course, due to being a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their web page did not change yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, the European side on
cannabis is very critical.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have still even countries who did not
approve medicinal cannabis yet,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially Eastern countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is where we are in discussion with
the governments in Romania, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_06]: to lift that ban, to train them on the
situation, and also to give them
[SPEAKER_06]: information from other authorities,
like B-Farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: The survey was maybe statistical,
not really accurate.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was excellent, but I think it brought a
lot of information which maybe one
[SPEAKER_06]: authority can adopt from another
authority.
[SPEAKER_06]: The same was also for the Spanish hearing,
which is now ongoing, where we commented
[SPEAKER_06]: as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is things which are moving,
but it is something what you have to
[SPEAKER_06]: consider to be on a long run.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is nothing which we can solve,
I think, in one or two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's quite interesting from
a European perspective, in the sense of,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for the audience, and we're both
CETA and I, European.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I'm from the UK, so the
continent Europe, not part of the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just lucky I've got two passports.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, for those that are not part of
Europe, novel foods has been around since
[SPEAKER_01]: 1997.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, if it's not been in your
dietary system since, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: the 15th of May, 1997, if I'm correct,
it's seen as novel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we got water is not novel,
this has been in our dietary system
[SPEAKER_01]: forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: In February 2019, if I'm not mistaken,
Europe or Brussels decided that CBD was
[SPEAKER_01]: novel in its extracted form, not hemp seed
oil compressed, but CBD itself was novel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why novel foods is relevant for
Europe and the UK, because even though the
[SPEAKER_01]: UK left with Brexit, we adopted the same
philosophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically, anything with CBD had to
go through your application process,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the UK, we basically carbon copied
that approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there was a hybrid model.
[SPEAKER_01]: The UK thought that they'd be clever
because of Brexit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whilst we were going through our
transitional period, which was back in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2020, what we said was, and I think,
if I'm not mistaken, around about the 13th
[SPEAKER_01]: of February 2020, the Food Standards
Agency in the UK said, look, we adopt the
[SPEAKER_01]: approach by Europe to say that CBD is
novel and you have to submit a novel foods
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you're on the market,
so basically, if you've been selling
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you shouldn't have been
selling at that time, you can continue
[SPEAKER_01]: selling, but you've got to submit an
application once we open our portal,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was 1st of January, 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got to submit an application
and you've got to submit the application
[SPEAKER_01]: before the 31st of March, 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally, though, they said they would
validate all applications by the 31st of
[SPEAKER_01]: March.
[SPEAKER_01]: They then changed the goalposts because
there's someone here in New York in the
[SPEAKER_01]: audience, a client of mine that was
involved in a couple of these
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had over 800 applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, the Food Standards Agency
had never dealt with a novel foods
[SPEAKER_01]: application because it was all through
EFSA previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they thought, oh darn, we're not going
to be able to validate all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they changed the goalposts at
submission point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you'd submitted your applications by
the 31st of March, 2021, you could
[SPEAKER_01]: continue selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what happened was they said,
we're going to have to validate everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to be very careful with the
language.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is where a lot of our
friends from the States and Canada and
[SPEAKER_01]: those that weren't part of the European
discussions at the time, confused words
[SPEAKER_01]: with validation and authorization because
they're completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So validation, and I don't want to bore
you guys, as I'm a lawyer, because no
[SPEAKER_01]: one's paying me for this discussion,
so there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually charge for this, but no,
I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I don't want to bore you on the
legal side of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, validation is a tick box
exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, have you submitted an
application?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it contain all the relevant parts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you submitted all the information,
including testing and so on and so forth,
[SPEAKER_01]: and when that data is going to be readily
available?
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, that's a valid application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's validated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's as basic as I can get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it goes through the regulator
checking it and seeing if it's safe and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the various toxicology data and
reviewing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get authorization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Europe, that's the only time that
you can sell once you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: authorization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that's clear in the mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the UK, they said, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you're validated, you can carry on
selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we authorize you,
great, you can continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not authorized, then you're off
the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That created, one, a hybrid model,
but also a monopoly for those that were
[SPEAKER_01]: already selling illicitly, and they
shouldn't have been, which meant that
[SPEAKER_01]: investment or other opportunities from the
states or Canada couldn't bring in a
[SPEAKER_01]: product where maybe they had the safety
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they already had a product that was
selling that had no THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could submit an application.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because they hadn't been selling
pre-13th February 2020 in the UK,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would have to wait until they were
fully authorized, a bit like in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it created this monopoly, which I had
massive arguments with the Food Standards
[SPEAKER_01]: Agency because I said, that's not your
role as a regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your role as a regulator is to ensure that
consumers are consuming something that is
[SPEAKER_01]: safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't be creating this infighting
between the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are we now since all of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the UK, we've now got a public list of
those that are, I would say, a few that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been given that validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Food Standards Agency is still saying
on their public list, awaiting evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I checked this morning, just so I gave you
a proper, proper idea of what of how many
[SPEAKER_01]: products on that list.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12,115 products on that list, of which I
don't know how many companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: because obviously, as you can imagine,
some companies have a variety of SKUs and
[SPEAKER_01]: product lines and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one way, it's a good thing,
I think, and I'm not saying this because
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a UK lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was completely against the process,
so I just want to make that clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in one way, it's been beneficial
because at least those businesses can
[SPEAKER_01]: continue selling and earning some money,
because they then invested so much money
[SPEAKER_01]: into their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones that are probably still there
are probably the ones that are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue still being there for longevity,
subject to the regulator giving them that
[SPEAKER_01]: final certification that they're
authorized to continue selling,
[SPEAKER_01]: subject to those products being safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the screenshot of where we are
in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like now to introduce Constant
again, because obviously, he's a scientist
[SPEAKER_01]: from the food industry, and he can give us
some insight of where Canada is now,
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe the journey that Canada's taken,
because fundamentally, us here in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: and the UK are always looking at Canada
and the US saying, you'll leap years
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead, but are you when it comes to food?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just after hearing how you described the
UK and the approach that the UK is taking
[SPEAKER_00]: on novel food, I do draw some
similarities, but there are stark
[SPEAKER_00]: contrasts between what the Canadians are
doing versus the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Health Canada, CFIA, they always get a
bad rap in Canada because they're always
[SPEAKER_00]: seen as over regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some situations, that is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that Health Canada and their
approach for novel foods or just edibles
[SPEAKER_00]: in general, sounds to be probably a very
good middle ground to ensuring really the
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimate goal is to consumer safety,
making sure that the food products that is
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the marketplace is safe for
consumption, there's no contaminants,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no micro, and that your consistent
quality is met for every different batch
[SPEAKER_00]: that you produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the approach that Health Canada takes
for approving novel foods is that for
[SPEAKER_00]: producers, let's take it from like a
producer who's never done edibles before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they would need to do is they need
to establish their food safety program,
[SPEAKER_00]: prerequisites, such as your preventative
control program, to ensuring that every
[SPEAKER_00]: step of your manufacturing process
controls and mitigates the risks to an
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be your chemical contaminants,
heavy metals, aflatoxins, you name it,
[SPEAKER_00]: to micro levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Health Canada doesn't dictate which
pharmacopoeia you can use, so there is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually quite a bit wiggle room between
different testing standards that might fit
[SPEAKER_00]: better for your product category,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, the EP pharmacopoeia
versus that of USP, EP is quite a bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: stringent in terms of micro requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see a lot of Canadian producers
actually choose the less stringent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacopoeia.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're registering new products as
well, it's actually on the burden of the
[SPEAKER_00]: producers to ensuring that their products
is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through your PCPs, once you've done
that, then you do your final testing to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that it's homogenous,
so your cannabinoids, all that stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent batch to batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have that, you just keep it
in-house, you don't really need to present
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you submit a new cannabis,
sorry, notice of new cannabis product to
[SPEAKER_00]: Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is where we do things a little
bit differently, in that Health Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't technically have to put a rubber
stamp on your new product to say that this
[SPEAKER_00]: is approved, now you can sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you a 60-day window of the time
that you submit for an NNCP, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: after that 60 days, automatically you can
start selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of good in a sense that it
leaves the responsibility and the
[SPEAKER_00]: ownership of the safety, the
commercialization as well as the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of the product up to the LP and that,
sorry, licensed producer, and if that
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed producer produces fantastic
product, it's consistent, it's also safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can pretty much guarantee that it's
gonna have no issues down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also seeing issues now where
people do these NNCPs, they wait to 60
[SPEAKER_00]: days, they start selling, but then Health
Canada comes in because they get a market
[SPEAKER_00]: complaint saying that this product may not
be compliant to certain regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most recent issue that came within
Canada is the edible extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which one of you guys here
are Canadian or not, but basically what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened was in Canada, you're only
allowed to have 10 milligrams of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: within your finished product, retail
product, whereas these companies kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: found a loophole and classified these as
extracts as opposed to edibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the extracts requirement is you're
allowed to have way more THC within your
[SPEAKER_00]: finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, Health Canada stood fast
on their determination that these
[SPEAKER_00]: particular products, which are like
lozenges, things that typically in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past when it's not infused with cannabis,
is more seen as kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: over-the-counter health products,
like cold remedies, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other products in the marketplace
as well that was caught with the mixture
[SPEAKER_00]: of melatonin with cannabinoids,
the justification for somehow piecing the
[SPEAKER_00]: melatonin as a stabilizing agent,
but really it's an active ingredient and
[SPEAKER_00]: in the eyes of Health Canada, when you
have an active ingredient such as
[SPEAKER_00]: melatonin, you must have a DIN number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Constant, that's quite interesting because
obviously, I don't know if the audience
[SPEAKER_01]: has picked up on this, but you've been
talking about products that contain THC as
[SPEAKER_01]: food, edibles, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the UK and Europe, we've only submitted
applications that contain CBD because
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational is not yet legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, it is now in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, and I could be wrong here,
maybe just a side question here,
[SPEAKER_01]: how's the European Food Standards Agency
going to look at an edible that contains
[SPEAKER_01]: THC because that will still have to go
through a novel foods application,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for the F side, it would be an
easy one because, of course, the German
[SPEAKER_06]: legislation does not apply for the
European regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: For them, it will be still, of course,
a narcotic and will be seen as that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think here, the door will be closed very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in similar terms, Germany,
if it's a food product, follows novel
[SPEAKER_01]: foods, so if it's an edible that's THC,
would that still have to have novel foods
[SPEAKER_01]: authorization if it was going to be sold
as a food supplement of some sort?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and I think this is where we have the
difficulties that we do not have
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmacological arguments, what was put
now in place, but political.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, EFCE is not listening to
political arguments in that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have here now, of course, a disruptive
situation with Germany and the European
[SPEAKER_06]: community.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why the legalization let me say is
concentrated on clubs and not like a
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial trade business because then we
are still in the Schengen, which is at the
[SPEAKER_06]: end replicating the single convention
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and the reason I raise that as a
point of discussion just for food for
[SPEAKER_01]: thought, using novel foods, food for
thought for the audience really is because
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to think about this because
obviously, I don't know who's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: audience, but I'm sure there's
entrepreneurs and people that are looking
[SPEAKER_01]: to invest in business or maybe continue
with their business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because Germany has gone recreational
doesn't mean that we've all blown
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational because again, like all of
cannabis, you've got a variety of products
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can create.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to read a lot of what's happened in
Canada, the good and the bad stuff because
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe doesn't really like Canada when it
comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've not done some great things,
obviously present company excluded,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when it comes to where the
recreational market, and this may be
[SPEAKER_01]: something for you just to touch on,
we all see the news that everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to ban smoking generally,
and that's tobacco, nicotine, and what
[SPEAKER_01]: that looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read, and I could be wrong,
and you're from Canada, maybe you can
[SPEAKER_01]: explain, that when it comes to
recreational cannabis, it's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people want to get high,
but they don't want to actually smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: something to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to eat something or they want to
experience another way of getting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a general trend in Canada as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of restrictions in
Canada, and it varies provincial to
[SPEAKER_00]: provincials, what the requirements are and
what you are and you aren't allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general rule is you're not allowed
smoking anything inside a building,
[SPEAKER_00]: a public building, and within X number of
feet or meters from an entrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, and there's also that stigma to
cannabis that even though Canada has been
[SPEAKER_00]: full legal for five, six years now,
like full recreational, there's still that
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma that the Canadians are still trying
to overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles and even vape products,
it's a good alternative where you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need to have that cannabis smell,
the pungent cannabis smell, especially for
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals who like to partake,
but they obviously don't want to have any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of negative thought process from
people exterior if they walk by them and
[SPEAKER_00]: they smell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your point, I think there is a push
towards more edibles now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing a ton more edibles launching
every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a justification for that,
and it's because more professionals
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't want to smell like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a younger generation as well
don't associate with smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm old enough to remember watching movies
where people used to smoke on screen or
[SPEAKER_01]: even smoke on planes, and that whole
culture is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's also changed for producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are also producing something that
they know that culturally it fits with
[SPEAKER_01]: their younger generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It obviously feels that Canada and
something that Europe still is far away
[SPEAKER_01]: from is food products that contain THC
because we're only talking about food
[SPEAKER_01]: products that contain CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still far from that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're right, until it's not seen
as a narcotic from the foods perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's hard to see how that's going to
happen any day soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how much time we've got
because there's no time on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could leave some questions now for the
audience before I can continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have a few, but if there's any
questions from the audience, there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: guys with mics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've left.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've bored the organizers on food.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've all left the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have an idea of how long this could
take to have the first novel food
[SPEAKER_02]: authorization on CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, for example, some synthetic
applications where you have no risk of
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've returned to the building.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first ones, the assessment is expiring
this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were really wondering if this year
something will come out or it will take
[SPEAKER_02]: longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I can take that because I think
this is the complication of the EFSA
[SPEAKER_06]: because EFSA is not one body but a
container.
[SPEAKER_06]: It contains several subcommittees.
[SPEAKER_06]: To bring it through this kind of,
let me say, odyssey of bodies,
[SPEAKER_06]: this is why I'm taking and this is why I
mentioned the sample of the probiotics,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is so clear for us for more than 25
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still, we are not having valid claims,
although so many even big companies,
[SPEAKER_06]: Nestle supplied a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot predict anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a good lawyer, I will not give you any
bad promises.
[SPEAKER_06]: The situation is still open and you all
know that CBD was meanwhile even under
[SPEAKER_06]: control substance, which then has been
stopped fortunately because there was also
[SPEAKER_06]: no pharmacological reason for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the situation still remains
unclear and we are delivered to the mercy
[SPEAKER_06]: of the authority.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're taking my job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it for Sita.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sita, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Marijn.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask, two years ago,
or was it three years ago, there was a
[SPEAKER_03]: Polish court which decided that hemp leaf
extracts are not novel food.
[SPEAKER_03]: This made quite some waves, but
unfortunately I haven't heard anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a reply from the EFSA rebuting
it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but hemp is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hemp never been a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seed is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is allowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it is a problem in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of cases where companies are
not allowed to sell because they say
[SPEAKER_03]: there's still novel food in application.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get the letters.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can give you later the page of the
authority for food and there's clearly
[SPEAKER_06]: stated that seed, that hemp is not a
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not talking about seed,
I'm talking about the leaves and the
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the biggest chocolate brands,
Ritter Sport, has created a cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: chocolate which was of course based on
hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had the cannabis leaf in front.
[SPEAKER_06]: They made a kind of few batches,
but then it disappeared.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was some kind of admonition because
they said, I don't know, just theory,
[SPEAKER_06]: but they made some chocolate which was of
course with hemp and not with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as one of the biggest chocolate brands,
they are not very risk-adaptive,
[SPEAKER_06]: so I am sure that there was some
clarification that this is possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we have hemp oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to add to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flower, like in most of European
countries and in the UK, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: food, it's a controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on that side of things, it's very
difficult to say that that's not novel as
[SPEAKER_01]: a food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen the Polish discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I explained right at the beginning,
there was a big, big case that went before
[SPEAKER_01]: Brussels, before 2019, that tried to quash
the notion that CBD wasn't novel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm not arguing for that or against
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: That discussion happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: That discussion actually came from the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually the CTA and I think,
I've forgotten the European counterpart,
[SPEAKER_01]: that put an application or statement to
Brussels to say, CBD is not novel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been in our dietary system and so on
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp has been around for hundreds if not
thousands of years and they lost,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why, they lost, I wasn't
there, I didn't argue the points,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they lost on the technicality,
I believe, I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was after that that they made the
announcement that CBD as an extracted form
[SPEAKER_01]: was novel and if it was going to be
contained in food, it had to go through
[SPEAKER_01]: this novel foods process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I hate to have to cut you off,
but we are over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it again for our wonderful
panel, Ricardo Geada, Sita Schubert,
[SPEAKER_04]: Constant Ma.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the International Cannabis
Business Conference, Berlin, 2020.
[SPEAKER_04]: 24.
