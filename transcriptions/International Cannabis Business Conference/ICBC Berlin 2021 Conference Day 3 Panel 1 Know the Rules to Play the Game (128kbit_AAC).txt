[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus, whenever technology works,
literally downloading, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, I'm Nick Easley,
CEO of 3C, also managing director of
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiverse Capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome that you all have the courage to
be here today and do what you do in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be it new, be it 15 years, be it the
people that are in fricking prison for
[SPEAKER_00]: getting medicine to people for literally
almost the last 80 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being here and having the
courage to stand up for this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patience, each other, be it if you're
driven by profit, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: After this last year and a half,
holy shit, we're still here and we're only
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little disclaimer, I always have to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a CPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what you do in this industry,
you must use these sorts of professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structuring companies, tax, finance,
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do one thing wrong, you lose your
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do one thing wrong, you lose your
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to fucking jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a once in a lifetime opportunity
when it comes to capital raising,
[SPEAKER_00]: structuring your companies and creating
things that are gonna be legacy entities
[SPEAKER_00]: or generational wealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That only happens once in a blue moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like alcohol happened, tobacco happened,
tech happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other big pioneer industries do we
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're like, I'm gonna do this new
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a time and a place for that,
but if there's professionals that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been there and done that, you don't go
climb Everest and be like, I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna do that without a guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Wim Hof, but I don't even think he
wore clothes or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wim Hof, you know him anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry if I offend you, your company,
your business, you can't fix stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not to offend, but when you fight the
truth, you lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the truth being, I've done this for 15
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm originally a farm kid from Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty poor farm kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisconsin's kind of like Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mustard, Nuglaris, like cheese,
sauerkraut, sauerruben, like very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of German sounding towns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very, very familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was in the United States Air Force
and was a crypto linguist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that ability of being in the military,
that professionalism and learning,
[SPEAKER_00]: I also got hurt in the service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, hey, if I hadn't gotten
hurt, I would have never found cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got out when I was 22 and a half,
went to Colorado in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tried cannabis compared to 14 drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this plant's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth giving a life to, like all of
us have pretty much done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many stories like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having been a true pioneer and not
having gotten killed yet, I've got some
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons for you from these trenches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanna share that based on EU and
what's happening in the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely use that microphone,
that microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, double fisting technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Global cannabis, some shit's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember when we first started the
compassionate use in 1996 in California?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all these other countries
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then things started moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Uruguay legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought that the International
Narcotics Control Board was just gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy that little country and nothing
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Canada happened on a medical
basis for federal as a country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that under compassionate use laws
because normally a new drug or something
[SPEAKER_00]: has to go through so much clinical trials,
API development.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just start making medical
claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember in the 80s when AIDS got
freaking crazy and people were like dying
[SPEAKER_00]: in the streets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we don't have time to go for 11
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are dying and the risks of these
new drugs and antivirals are worth the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is literally the same
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we have compassionate use
medical programs in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's those sorts of things that you
only have a window that that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this global landscape's
developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the United States we're close to 30
billion probably in revenue of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sales this year legal for medical and
adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the illicit market in the United
States many people thinks like 50,
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like close to 200 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not tracked and logged, not taxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just transitioning from one
thing to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't a brand new thing that we're
scared people might not use as investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: People already use it but we're making
standardized consumer packaged goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as this is happening you have one shot
to secure some of these opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now just like Giada said the most
interesting thing that happened this last
[SPEAKER_00]: year was in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said at the investment forum a
few days ago like when Ukraine leaned
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and he's like yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like damn he put us over the line
and we didn't think that was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we rescheduled cannabis
internationally so it's no longer like
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin which cannabis was the same as
heroin until December last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all like watching Netflix in
pajamas and the U.N.
[SPEAKER_00]: amended the scheduling for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still needs more research but has been
shown to have some medicinal benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step one of three steps that's going to
change the global landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like is that going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It frickin did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of the member nations of the
United of the United Nations that signed
[SPEAKER_00]: that drug compact in 1961 single
convention treaty on psychotropic
[SPEAKER_00]: substances are in violation of
international law that they said that they
[SPEAKER_00]: would agree to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all supposed to amend our own CSA
controlled substances act to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: alignment with that drug policy that we
ratified again in 1971 and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: times after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is huge news for investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clinical trials standardization of drugs
not just like GW pharmaceuticals with
[SPEAKER_00]: Epidiolex and some of those kind of crappy
products that are really expensive not
[SPEAKER_00]: super efficacious and have a few
milligrams of something from a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to allow other people to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that company's what market cap eight
billion dollars for a little pill that's
[SPEAKER_00]: got two point five milligrams of THC and
two point five milligrams of CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the United Nations kind of a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So raising capital in this industry is
very hard because it has been federally
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we break every day in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I break federal law with everything I do
like Pablo Escobar was like very little
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to what I've done in like
racketeering going state to state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't fly with weed from one state to
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like what we've literally done big
time and many of you to like we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about something that's literally illegal
and how to facilitate forming companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why many German lawyers or others
in the beginning with the Tinder they
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't even work with companies even on
Guam or many states the state Supreme
[SPEAKER_00]: Court or Bar Association Bar Association
will say you can't work with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like we're lawyers we're kind of
looking out for our client interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to raise capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just go to a bank and be like
I've got a business plan family offices
[SPEAKER_00]: high net worth individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go out public in a country that is
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada the CSE TSX.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why all of those Canadian public
companies were able to happen after 2015
[SPEAKER_00]: because it wasn't federally illegal there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't just start an IPO and go to Nasdaq
and be like hey cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this is a federal exchange
that's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't raise money to do something
federally illegal on a federal exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're not first you're last.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes when you're first you
actually get frickin murdered which if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely some navigation that
needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States is one of these key
markets that being there breaking federal
[SPEAKER_00]: law state by state the cannabis we grow in
one state we can't bring it to another
[SPEAKER_00]: state to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like I have to grow cannabis in
Alaska to sell it in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to manufacture vape cartridges
edibles chocolates in Massachusetts from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis grown in Massachusetts to sell in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people can come from another state to
buy it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States now there's 19 states
that have legalized adult use cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: 21 years or older.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only about 10 well 10 currently
doing active sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: DC doesn't really count where our capital
is even though it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's this Harris amendment that
doesn't allow the federal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feds are like we won't give you any
taxes but and they won't allow stores but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's literally legal in Washington D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: for recreational cannabis where our
capital is where Buffalo Man like went and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like took it over in January which
we don't like to talk about but kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the United States is emerging fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where we make all of our revenue
all possibilities happen based on what's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you see brands and consumer
packaged goods and the development of new
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics next door and like challing with
Bedrikan in the Netherlands like they have
[SPEAKER_00]: their six standardized genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States when you look at
Phyllis Bioscience and some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: galaxies of genetics like there's over
16,000 individual different cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: chemovars or if you want to say strains
like this type of dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16,000 in the United States alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from land race varieties and
everything else this is a dioecious plant
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning like cannabis keeps its house its
sex in two houses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a male plant and a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the development in genetics there you
can't protect them like Driscoll in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biggest berry company in the world but
they have they make eight percent off of
[SPEAKER_00]: every plant that they sell and they get
first order refusal on the strawberries
[SPEAKER_00]: the blueberries you know the raspberries
but without even having to grow a single
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can't protect a genetic if I get a
seed of yours or cutting of yours a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: and I make a copy of that like I go to
your grandma's house and she's got a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: African violet and I take that little leaf
and put in some water grows little roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a clone like that Dolly sheep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the exact same thing but you can't
sue me for stealing your intellectual
[SPEAKER_00]: property because there's no breeder's
rights in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Internationally once you standardize
genetics you can start to do brand
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing of those and surprisingly in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and internationally it's not illegal to
own the intellectual property to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an ancillary opportunity which
isn't even high risk which big banks and
[SPEAKER_00]: others could actually get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more states coming forward it's
only a matter of time there was a two week
[SPEAKER_00]: period this last year where New York
governor signed adult use New Jersey New
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico and Virginia and I was like what
the fuck just happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd been going slowly state by state
educate senators we get this medical law
[SPEAKER_00]: passed it goes through a bunch of BS and
was just like boom boom boom boom and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like holy shit like I guess we're gonna
need a bigger boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was one of those moments that is
like this is faster than we even thought
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're not ready for federal
legalization in the United States because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so compartmentalized state by state
doing different pesticide regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking taxation that we're not actually
ready to like just do a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: consolidation because the second that
federal legalization does happen massive
[SPEAKER_00]: rollups institutional capital will gobble
up through consolidations and mergers and
[SPEAKER_00]: none of you unless you're that has a shot
and like British American tobacco Philip
[SPEAKER_00]: Morris everybody's on the sidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is too risky for them to play in
these little games.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll let us take all the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh you're gonna make a couple hundred
million dollars here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh you a billion dollar valuation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna buy you and if you don't sell to
me I'll destroy you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these are very powerful entities that
have generational wealth behind them that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have one shot to build this and as I
commonly say it's not about I'm gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: the next Pfizer or I'm gonna be the next
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: There already is a Pfizer there already is
an Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to sell to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very seldomly do you actually get to have
a disruptive company like Airbnb but then
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have challenger companies like VRBO
or the 19 other million things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Uber and then you got DD and then
you got this and then you got you know
[SPEAKER_00]: here now or whatever you guys use of
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the United States look what's happening
there because it's gonna dictate kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like what's happening in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 minutes in kicking ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest things is understanding
cost of goods sold in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're like I'm gonna be the next world
leader in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have this massive greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: See large Denmark or some other places
it's like what's the cost of production
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your VAT taxes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your climate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember farm kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much does it cost me to grow that
Echinacea to make one gallon of milk or
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.78 liters you know fucking Americans
with our measurement systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so idiots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apologize in advance for America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like little toddlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happened originally is yeah we're
like new like you guys been around for
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds like thousands of years people
have been living here and the same in
[SPEAKER_00]: America but like with like developed
civilizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get this first mover opportunity just
like the Canadians and that's why they
[SPEAKER_00]: built like hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of hectares of greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor plantations massive warehouses
like till really I'm gonna take a giant
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate factory and make it into a giant
weed factory like when it costs you six
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred dollars or five hundred and twenty
some euros to produce one pound or a half
[SPEAKER_00]: a kilo of cannabis that doesn't make sense
from an agricultural standpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature airflow humidity daytime highs
nighttime lows precipitation frost free
[SPEAKER_00]: days all of these things determine where
is the best place to grow strawberries or
[SPEAKER_00]: oranges or pineapples or whatever
agricultural commodity it is which this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a fucking plant we're talking about that
makes amazing biological compounds it's
[SPEAKER_00]: also an entheogen just like lots of other
plants and fungi that are illegal but only
[SPEAKER_00]: do one weird thing at a time you know
cannabis we got to get this thing legal in
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine for everybody but if you
understand your cogs you're raising
[SPEAKER_00]: capital it's not just about that if you're
not first your last thing sometimes being
[SPEAKER_00]: first is stupid but like licenses
hopefully the person's maybe not here but
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday there's this person's like I
have this license I'm like I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: literally gotten you 10 million euros for
that in 2017 I'm like I don't even really
[SPEAKER_00]: see the value of like 150 200,000 for that
piece of paper anymore there's pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: paper that canopy until Ray and Aurora
went after that they spent 30 50 80
[SPEAKER_00]: million dollars not on bribes but like
government relations and then those assets
[SPEAKER_00]: have been sold for like three million
euros like what they did in Spain what
[SPEAKER_00]: they did in South Africa what they like
they were like we're gonna take over South
[SPEAKER_00]: America and spent billions of investors
money from their stock exchanges and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a single position there anymore
even though that's where if you've heard
[SPEAKER_00]: of a company like Dole if you hold your
Colombian positions your Peruvian
[SPEAKER_00]: positions and you make it through and you
understand your cogs when this emerges and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not this compartmentalized patchwork
of I can do this here and not here and
[SPEAKER_00]: that and this is a bona fide commodity
you're gonna be dull it's not gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: like oh we have a greenhouse in Iceland
and like we're gonna take over the world
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah that happened with Canada didn't work
so much we buy their greenhouses we
[SPEAKER_00]: rebuild them in the United States for like
ten cents on the dollar right now and they
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep growing more and more so here we
are you Europe navigating this complex
[SPEAKER_00]: framework which I've been doing since 2015
like having done you know Denmark Germany
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal worked with Slovenia Romanian
kind of Hempside Poland Hempside France
[SPEAKER_00]: like that first kind of R&D market
experiment thing is the only market we
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't participated in from a new license
application standpoint which getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: first piece of paper even though I'm
saying sometimes doesn't have value they
[SPEAKER_00]: do majorly but when you think about what's
happening in the European Union minus
[SPEAKER_00]: Brexit ish kind of thing which is kind of
you know still one of those touchy
[SPEAKER_00]: subjects over here but that's gonna be a
unique opportunity with the UK as well
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with their Commonwealth or like
a couple conversations yesterday like with
[SPEAKER_00]: France or other places that still have
those territories back from like
[SPEAKER_00]: imperialism days which we don't like to
talk about too much but kind of still
[SPEAKER_00]: happened and actually still super
profitable from war rape till it tyranny
[SPEAKER_00]: from like 500 years ago but what's gonna
happen in Europe is gonna dictate based on
[SPEAKER_00]: EU GMP compliance standards especially
with PICS countries so you know American
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of scene here it's like we landed on
the shore we're like fuck you Europe like
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna go do our own thing over here
it's awesome it's like we were with you
[SPEAKER_00]: but like we don't want to like we're gonna
sign this declaration and do our own thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's like what's over there what's to
the West who knows new green field
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities blue ocean sorts of
opportunities you're like it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking incredible we're gonna like find
all this stuff and gold and then sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you literally get murdered and
there's people there to like this is ours
[SPEAKER_00]: or like I'm gonna go over here this is a
great idea and bam you fall off a cliff so
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes being first is very very
important but it takes a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: first pioneers that got out there and like
just like I like that bottom picture there
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like if you do things wrong you're
the same as that dude like how you doing
[SPEAKER_00]: like where you going so as you're paving
this way here this is green field as well
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe it's green field around the
world and it's green field in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States but I have seen hundreds and
hundreds of companies thousands start fail
[SPEAKER_00]: scale merge and it's not about I'm gonna
go and claim and plant my flag here and
[SPEAKER_00]: take this like I said the other day it's
like you look left you look right that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be your biggest competitor here or
there but when we collaborate in human
[SPEAKER_00]: culture and human nature we always succeed
more like many of the languages I had to
[SPEAKER_00]: study it's like there's no personal
pronoun of I it's only we this is ours we
[SPEAKER_00]: share this and like we do and this plant
it's like I own this this is my IP but
[SPEAKER_00]: like this plant we're caretakers of it and
it's our duty as an industry to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: this responsibly for one time with some
consciousness before it just gets taken
[SPEAKER_00]: over and all of a sudden you've got
Seagrams and Bacardi and Constellation and
[SPEAKER_00]: just giant companies that have had things
for like ever like from fur trading to
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco when there's a new thing you've
got one shot but it's the collaboration of
[SPEAKER_00]: not like I'm gonna use this investment
it's mine yeah sometimes I'm a fund
[SPEAKER_00]: manager I do protect my portfolio
companies but I make them bigger by
[SPEAKER_00]: combining investments of other investors
so really just think like even though
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like this is mine and there's so
much competition out there if you all
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborate you can be strong against
things and even though the Native
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans were actually right in this
context we were kind of the wrong ones but
[SPEAKER_00]: that metaphor just let it stick with you
if you do things wrong and you think you
[SPEAKER_00]: know everything you literally might get
shot in the back front side doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's the best idea in the world
they even still fail so a big thing like
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Dutch weed experiment I wanted to
go over Giada I saw you yesterday so I had
[SPEAKER_00]: my staff use one of yours this was big we
applied for this we helped two groups to
[SPEAKER_00]: get this and also a big United States
company cookies brand got this so the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment we all know about coffee houses
in the red light district and how that all
[SPEAKER_00]: works out kind of not from personal
experience of course or any of you so in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Netherlands this whole coffee house
thing like you can't grow it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands you can't import it but they
regulate the sale of it for residents but
[SPEAKER_00]: then they only check IDs at the border
near Germany at those certain coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: houses so then the Dutch government's like
one fucking Dutch love taxes who doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: but like taxes are like heroin to a
government and once they get a taste
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how we've tricked so many states
into legalizing it's like tax revenue jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're like mmm and they literally
become addicts and then they'll be fight
[SPEAKER_00]: the other markets and they'll go after the
illicit market because they're not paying
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes and more importantly especially like
you know Lewis the past director of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana enforcement division here had to
deal with like wow we're regulating a new
[SPEAKER_00]: industry but then there's all these
pesticide issues or safety issues or like
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't call OSHA to come and deal with
like all these bamboo stakes and like
[SPEAKER_00]: people burning sulfur inside to kill kill
fungus you do that in like greenhouses or
[SPEAKER_00]: caves and things like that but not when
people are there this is the most
[SPEAKER_00]: important shit that's happening on your
goddamn continent right now this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: first adult use sanctioned weed experiment
even though it was a weed experiment
[SPEAKER_00]: before they called it officially the weed
experiment it was hilarious when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing those applications and having to
translate all this stuff into Dutch it was
[SPEAKER_00]: nuts I'm like this is the first legally
sanctioned produced cannabis in Europe for
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe and you've all gone to Amsterdam
maybe or maybe not and had an Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: space cake or some random cones you're
like I'm gonna try this Bubba Kush or this
[SPEAKER_00]: you had no idea what you're getting but
the amount of pesticides fungi and other
[SPEAKER_00]: things in that from the test that we've
done from independent sampling not like
[SPEAKER_00]: this maybe a little not this one maybe but
these 10 companies are the only companies
[SPEAKER_00]: with licenses to do this and the brands
that are developed there as tourists go
[SPEAKER_00]: there and get familiarized with those
consumer packaged goods like I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: start a giant brand in Germany or like
with this and that when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis internationally it's not
about brands it's about cost of production
[SPEAKER_00]: and like the contract for import export
and all about compliance it's not even
[SPEAKER_00]: about your brand at all but this is gonna
change everything for Europe this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: foothold into this continent got two
exclusive positions on investment there
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to be massive and not just
for the revenue the Dutch will make but
[SPEAKER_00]: for the IP and brand licensing companies
that are established the consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition of those consumer packaged
goods and that will dictate the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: future of this continent and what's gonna
happen in the next year year and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: two years so is Germany gonna be the
cannabis capital of frickin Europe no
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not B farm was kind of annoying to
deal with originally thank God that B farm
[SPEAKER_00]: inframed all of these the Danish medicines
agencies do what they do but each one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those is just like each state regulator
like that we have to deal with how are we
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna regulate pesticides how are we gonna
give licenses who's gonna pay me more to
[SPEAKER_00]: do this I'm gonna give licenses to my
brother and my cousin and my uncle not
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about North Macedonia here but
maybe or some other places or Greece or
[SPEAKER_00]: how the military is gonna do all Italy's
minus the Hempside awesome things are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna happen here and thank God the B farm
allowed compassion use medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for patients that needed medicine which is
the main reason we do what we do getting
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine to people be it medical or
through adult use there's gonna be great
[SPEAKER_00]: companies here ancillary business
opportunities you're not first next door
[SPEAKER_00]: is think about some investment there
especially with BV and their taxes be
[SPEAKER_00]: really careful with some of these other
novel cannabinoids as you're going through
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe you're like well I can't get this
license I'm gonna do CBD I'm gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta 8 that's gonna get scheduled like
heroin very soon whenever you isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: something from nature it's a very
dangerous and takes 11 years of clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trials and about half a billion dollars to
know if it's safe or not even for
[SPEAKER_00]: something like vitamin C so just because
there's this quasi gray area it's
[SPEAKER_00]: literally black and white and you can't
build an empire on ambiguity like that so
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to be very careful picks countries
are super important look at all those blue
[SPEAKER_00]: ones in Europe if you do clinical trials
drug development standardization of
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines that's where you can sell it to
all the big countries with all the money
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world that have the largest market
share of drugs and then the generics start
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen but any of the countries that
are in blue that also have medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis programs massive opportunities
screw all that IP super important I talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about that a tad the ancillary
opportunities are enormous also for Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: as this is starting to develop because
like I said it's not illegal to own
[SPEAKER_00]: something the property and knowledge on
how to do this or the real estate and like
[SPEAKER_00]: some of our conversations this week like
in the United States we make 12 to 18
[SPEAKER_00]: percent on real estate where I own the
building and I'm literally making 18.8
[SPEAKER_00]: percent because they can't go to a bank I
get huge returns for our investors on that
[SPEAKER_00]: and when it comes to just like our
dispenser is going to be legal in Germany
[SPEAKER_00]: and then well which real estate churches
schools parks daycares addiction centers
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial zoning one manufacturing to
commercial zoning for this that the other
[SPEAKER_00]: like I got this property is gonna work
probably not in my experience like 10,000
[SPEAKER_00]: real estate type plays 99 percent of the
time if you have a property it's not zoned
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly doesn't have three-phase power
doesn't have natural gas doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: water doesn't have legal access or
entitlement no one wants to go and live
[SPEAKER_00]: and work there like the 40 20-hectare
greenhouse in Arizona that a company I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna say their name built middle of
goddamn nowhere so you have to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: all these things and really analyze those
but the ancillary side is huge there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: hilarious pitches there but I think it
self-censored me because I was too too
[SPEAKER_00]: vulgar I'll leave that up to your mind but
in the future just know when you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: through these new greenfield places if
there's a body on your left and a body on
[SPEAKER_00]: your right and something has been done and
people have failed numerous times in other
[SPEAKER_00]: markets like the most valuable thing in
human history is knowing what not to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it's only through knowing what not to do
can you actually start to see what to do
[SPEAKER_00]: so look at all these examples in Canada
like giant warehouses high cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: production using bad pesticides not having
good integrated pest management I dealt
[SPEAKER_00]: with a company in Colorado they were not
gonna name 58 million in revenue they were
[SPEAKER_00]: netting $300,000 58 million in revenue
that's like an airline profit margin even
[SPEAKER_00]: worse like airlines are like one to like
six maybe Southwest is like 12% probably
[SPEAKER_00]: not these are numbers pre-runa I don't
know the post ones this is it we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: very short window until these UN laws
start to happen countries are gonna start
[SPEAKER_00]: to fold and massive positions like
Columbia where it was first just oil now
[SPEAKER_00]: flour they're not a picks country but like
I can produce a kilo of the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: quality cannabis you've ever seen there
for about five euros and less and less in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future through combines and things so
agricultural commodity consumer packaged
[SPEAKER_00]: goods retail consumer experience if you
focus on this like outside industry things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are already known you will succeed if
you come up with some harebrained idea on
[SPEAKER_00]: how to do a cannabis cryptocurrency
crowdfunding program with some blockchain
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't know throwing some drunk
hookers in there too and you think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be a great idea or like a body sushi
party like we have to be mindful no I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna say that company's name either
we have to be mindful in what we do this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity this
is probably the last great emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in humankind and if we do it
right it's not just for you and your
[SPEAKER_00]: profits or generational wealth we're
creating something we're in a past of
[SPEAKER_00]: future generations this plants been with
us literally from the sea squirt 330
[SPEAKER_00]: million years ago through a weird little
evolution that made a cannabinoid receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: and this thing's not even brain that we're
relatives to has been like passing through
[SPEAKER_00]: it that was a receptor for a plant that
hadn't even evolved yet we're caretakers
[SPEAKER_00]: of this we're evolving with this evolve
adapt use good experts we are fighting a
[SPEAKER_00]: war and need so much capital to do this
and a lot of the big companies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: out there are very terrifying investment
opportunities but there's so much good to
[SPEAKER_00]: be done in this space and we can't do
without good collaboration so really
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate the opportunity here today I
somehow made it on time I don't know if I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a question or two for you or if
somebody has one quick question don't be
[SPEAKER_00]: shy this your once-in-a-lifetime it's you
what do you got all right where where
[SPEAKER_00]: where did somebody raise their hand to
yell it out what you got
[SPEAKER_00]: here's the question like how do you like
small-scale operations mom-and-pop type
[SPEAKER_00]: things like little things kind of scale
like how do you fit into that especially
[SPEAKER_00]: with like bio or organic certifications so
one example in the United States organic
[SPEAKER_00]: certification is through the USDA the
United States Department of Agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: states can also do their own certification
and standards like Oregon and a few states
[SPEAKER_00]: can do that just like each state can do
their own pesticide regulation but when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing something federally illegal
it's really hard to get federal organic
[SPEAKER_00]: certification so one of my due diligence
like instant red flags is someone's like
[SPEAKER_00]: we grow cannabis organically so here's a
25,000 euro sentence for you we cultivate
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis following organic methodologies
using certified organic inputs I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: say I was organic anywhere I said the word
twice I marketed you think it's organic
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is it's close to it without that
label that is so expensive to do even as a
[SPEAKER_00]: small farmer when we tried to get organic
certified it was like a $10,000 thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like an acanacea farm in like
Wisconsin you can't do that so small mom
[SPEAKER_00]: and pops they've taken the risks merge
merge consolidate grow and get bought by
[SPEAKER_00]: something everyone can brew beer everyone
can make wine how many people do it how
[SPEAKER_00]: many people had some wine last night that
was home brewed it's fun to do once until
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to clean all those bottles and
deal with it so it takes a lot of money to
[SPEAKER_00]: do this well compliantly scale take market
share deal with liquor distribution but
[SPEAKER_00]: like I love a farmers market more than
anyone but like farmers markets how many
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes are sold at farmers markets
versus in supermarkets it's about 1.3%
[SPEAKER_00]: globally and that's including all like the
really poor countries that don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: Cisco or Nestle or other types of things
like that so if you are a small mom and
[SPEAKER_00]: pop and you have something unique you must
scale quickly or you will die and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: make false statements or health claims my
product cures cancer they will literally
[SPEAKER_00]: destroy you do not make fake health claims
do not make fake certifications do not lie
[SPEAKER_00]: do not make fraud and no matter what
there's a conversation or two yesterday I
[SPEAKER_00]: had like we're gonna do this we have this
building and this and that I'm like I've
[SPEAKER_00]: literally read your hundred and sixty page
law and know that what you're telling me
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually not even possible so if you're
gonna play this game and you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: die you don't get shot you don't want to
lose all your family's money or waste your
[SPEAKER_00]: life which is the only thing you have know
the rules to play the game and if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: help to write them and influence those
rules you're gonna own that game but do it
[SPEAKER_00]: legally not with corrupt lobbyists but
absolute honor to share what I know with
[SPEAKER_00]: you sorry for being offensive but like I
said this is what we've done what we do
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm not guessing so absolute honor
everyone thank you and wish you the best
[SPEAKER_00]: of luck Nick easily
