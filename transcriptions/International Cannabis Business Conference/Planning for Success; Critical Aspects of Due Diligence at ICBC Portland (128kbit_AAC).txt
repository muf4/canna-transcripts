[SPEAKER_04]: This one's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't always, this is often an
overlooked, an overlooked facet of the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Due diligence is very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to do your research.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to know your facts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have a plan in place,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're gonna bring up our moderator.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's the managing director of FTI
Consulting, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They work on cyber threats.
[SPEAKER_04]: They work on how to be in compliance with
the anti-money laundering laws,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: All the fraud, all your supply chain
issues, all your due diligence.
[SPEAKER_04]: They work on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can work with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna introduce her right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it for the one and only Elaine
Carey!
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your attention or for
joining us today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know people sort of their eyes can
glaze over when you talk about due
[SPEAKER_06]: diligence and compliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like a no, not more of those
things we have to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd like to, and I think my panelists
will join me in saying that it has a
[SPEAKER_06]: different, you can look at it in a
different way, i.e.
[SPEAKER_06]: to protect your bottom line, to make your
business stronger, to make it more viable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, in the future, you do wanna,
you know, when it becomes legal federally,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you wanna cash in on that, these are
the things you have to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you have to do it just now,
just to make your business survive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stand out from all the rest.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I always say to people, I have an
investigative background.
[SPEAKER_06]: If somebody else's business is softer,
they're cutting corners places,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's where the regulators, the
authorities are gonna go, and the bad guys
[SPEAKER_06]: as well, to infiltrate, because it's
easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've crossed all your T's,
dotted all your I's, you're a much safer,
[SPEAKER_06]: much healthier business.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we're here to talk about
today, which is the financial,
[SPEAKER_06]: operational, regulatory, and reputational
risk that you need to guard against.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not, it doesn't have to be heavy
lifting or really, really expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do this for clients, I do due diligence
backgrounds on the clients to give to
[SPEAKER_06]: investors, or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done anti-money laundering reviews
for financial institutions that wanna bank
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis money, thank goodness they're
willing to begin to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done it for Armour and Cart,
there are companies that wanna bank.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is interest out there,
but you've got to do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we've brought together a
pretty interesting panel that covers the
[SPEAKER_06]: entirety of those risks.
[SPEAKER_06]: We start with Bernard next to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bernard is from Emerge Law Group here in
Portland.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're the very first law group to
get into the business and have deep
[SPEAKER_06]: experience in a variety of issues that you
face, from land use to corporate
[SPEAKER_06]: structures, to tax, to employment,
to HR, and probably things I've forgotten
[SPEAKER_06]: that Bernard will tell you about.
[SPEAKER_06]: And next to Bernard is my colleague,
Lincoln Eckhart, who is a valuations and
[SPEAKER_06]: appraisal expert.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things I like about Lincoln
is he's also a native to Portland.
[SPEAKER_06]: But very early on, we started doing
cannabis services at FTI, which is a
[SPEAKER_06]: little unusual, because we are a publicly
traded company.
[SPEAKER_06]: We called up Lincoln and said,
can you value a cannabis company,
[SPEAKER_06]: even though it's kind of a startup and
they don't have a lot of formal processes
[SPEAKER_06]: and procedures, and maybe their books are
in Crayon, I don't know, or on maybe an
[SPEAKER_06]: Excel spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he goes, oh sure, done it before.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are the kind of people that you
need to, what we wanna do today is give
[SPEAKER_06]: you some concrete takeaways.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the last panelist member, Matt Murphy,
is Vice President of Chiron Life Sciences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Matt brings two unique attributes to
our panel today.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, he's actually running a cannabis
company that's based in Canada,
[SPEAKER_06]: but doing work in Columbia, as in Bogota,
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_06]: And two, Matt is a retired DEA agent who
was on the diversion side and worked in
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmaceuticals for more than 25 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think particularly helpful to have
Matt today after the DEA moved CBD from
[SPEAKER_06]: schedule one to schedule five the other
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think hopefully he can provide some
unique insight into how that happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's start with you, Bernard.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are some concrete things that
companies need to do in terms of being in
[SPEAKER_06]: compliance with the law, but that aren't
going to just sink the ship at the very
[SPEAKER_06]: beginning by getting, if you might say,
expensive legal advice, but that helps
[SPEAKER_06]: them grow and prosper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So expensive legal advice is tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tough target to hit sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of being able to cover your
bases on the front end without sinking the
[SPEAKER_00]: ship, as Elaine says,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the most productive approach is
to, is to identify the categories of
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it emerged, there's Emerge Law Group,
the firm I am with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of corporate lawyers
with deep securities law background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're starting a company and
you're looking at raising money from
[SPEAKER_00]: outside investors, it makes sense to be
meeting with someone like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you're not yet ready to form a
corporation or what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you're getting off on the
right foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another area that matters is obviously the
licensing end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now in the licensing environment
in Oregon, you're often talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: going through a process that can take many
months and there might be twists and turns
[SPEAKER_00]: along the way as the industry and the
regulatory environment continues to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not going to want to lose time
because you kind of went down,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe went down what seems to be a wrong
track in retrospect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also a number of areas that at
least a cannabis business person that is
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively new to what we used to call
kind of above ground business practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can make a lot of sense to be meeting
with an employment lawyer to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what steps you need to take now so that
you're not dealing with a potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive problem maybe just a few months
down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course there are land use and
local code and zoning issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's my area which is tax
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an area where I guess tax
professionals often kind of privately
[SPEAKER_00]: gripe about always being brought into
transactions late.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that is oftentimes you're
brought into a transaction and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of have an only if moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only if we had been having this
conversation three months or six months
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, we could be talking about a much
smaller tax bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of the discussion you'd be
having with a tax person on the front end,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd be talking about well, what sort of
business entity are we going to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we gonna be using more than one
business entity?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're trying to pencil out our
financials, what is this tax code section
[SPEAKER_00]: 280E issue and how does that really work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might end up setting up a very
small business that you know in your
[SPEAKER_00]: context makes sense from a tax
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you might be setting up a multi entity
structure with kind of specific goals in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe protecting risk averse investors
from potentially adverse or expensive tax
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences flowing through to their
personal returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you might be looking at ways to allow
your business to have access to the kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of expertise it needs without the
compensation you're paying those people
[SPEAKER_00]: being non-deductible because of 280E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you might be looking at ways to ensure
that when you renew your lease,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, that you don't end up losing
a $300,000 tax deduction just because you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't plan ahead in how you set up your
lease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're sitting down with an attorney
or different specialist attorneys as you
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of learn the lay of the land,
if you're sitting down with them on kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a brainstorming, a planning level,
and then you get together with your team
[SPEAKER_00]: after you've I guess educated yourself
somewhat in that environment, then I think
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to find that not only are
taxes much, it'll be a much less expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: proposition, but you're also going to be
able to manage those taxes in real time
[SPEAKER_00]: and not get behind the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then getting to the due diligence
portion of things, you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: having a potentially awkward conversation
with an investor who or a potential buyer
[SPEAKER_00]: down the road who comes from a world where
tax compliance is taken for granted and is
[SPEAKER_00]: just expected and who might start to
wonder what other problems you have simply
[SPEAKER_00]: because you have some unaddressed tax
issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Bernard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lincoln, we've seen all these mega
valuations coming out of Canada that could
[SPEAKER_06]: make anybody's eyes get stuck with dollar
signs in them because it just looks so...
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful, but at the same time maybe
fantastical.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things you'd said to me is
value is all about pricing risk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you explain what you mean about that
and what you see, what you think about
[SPEAKER_06]: these sort of, if you will, sky high
valuations going around and is that going
[SPEAKER_06]: to stay there forever?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thanks Elaine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's important to bifurcate the
public market from the private market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in Canada you have seen some sky
high valuations applied to cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a couple of reasons for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, it's Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different regulatory structure,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, the company's gone public.
[SPEAKER_03]: When a company goes public, it's really
been de-risked by a large magnitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also a lot of hot money that's
moving into that sector.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not atypical to see some of these
cannabis companies in Canada publicly
[SPEAKER_03]: traded that are trading at 100,
200, 400 times revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you come back to the private sector
and you look at what's happening in
[SPEAKER_03]: transactions in the private sector,
you see much more pedestrian multiples.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say there's a recent transaction in
Washington state of six large retail
[SPEAKER_03]: operations that sold at one times revenue
or .7 times next 12 months revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a far cry from a 400 times revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a big part of that is really what
I want to hit on in terms of the due
[SPEAKER_03]: diligence considerations, which is
valuation essentially is a pricing risk
[SPEAKER_03]: exercise.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're basically pricing risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Value equals the present value of future
expected cash flows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the sexiest thing in the world,
but that's how you value a business or any
[SPEAKER_03]: asset.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look at what are the expected future
cash flows and you present value those
[SPEAKER_03]: cash flows back to today.
[SPEAKER_03]: That present valuing exercise is that you
use a risk adjusted discount rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of build up a discount rate
based on the risks that you see in the
[SPEAKER_03]: asset or in the business.
[SPEAKER_03]: With cannabis companies, one of the
challenges are there's already sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: systematic risks that are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially because of the regulatory
environment, because of public perception,
[SPEAKER_03]: because of other factors, you already have
a risk premium built in when looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think to the benefit of owners or anyone
operating a business in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, the most critical thing you can
do is try to de-risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're thinking about a potential
exit down the road or trying to raise
[SPEAKER_03]: capital from outside investors,
whatever you can do to de-risk the
[SPEAKER_03]: enterprise, it's a direct correlation
between de-risking an enterprise and
[SPEAKER_03]: increasing the value.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're inversely related.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have systems in place,
processes in place, if you have money cash
[SPEAKER_03]: management systems, seed to sale systems
in place, you have contracts with your
[SPEAKER_03]: suppliers, with your wholesalers or
retailers, whatever aspect of the industry
[SPEAKER_03]: you're in.
[SPEAKER_03]: If those contracts have been vetted by
lawyers or written by lawyers and they've
[SPEAKER_03]: been validated, your financial systems,
your accounting systems, all these things
[SPEAKER_03]: that sometimes seem sort of mundane and
not of great value to you, you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily too concerned or thinking
about the more mundane aspects of the
[SPEAKER_03]: business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when you go to a point of trying to
raise capital or get a value assigned to
[SPEAKER_03]: this asset that you're building that you
own, it's all about that de-risking
[SPEAKER_03]: process, that an outside investor can come
in and look at your business and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, everything checks out, I don't see
any red flags here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That process and creating that system in
place, that enterprise, will directly pay
[SPEAKER_03]: off in terms of increased value.
[SPEAKER_03]: As Elaine said, we first started talking
about value in cannabis companies and she
[SPEAKER_03]: said a client, what happens if they just
have some spreadsheets and all their
[SPEAKER_03]: financials or basically just a couple of
Excel data sheets and that's all that we
[SPEAKER_03]: really have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're talking about the risk premium,
which is the risk that people are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: apply when you're present valuing those
cash flows or whether you're using a
[SPEAKER_03]: market multiple is directly correlated to
the quality of the information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another really important point is people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have great financial statements,
you can have these systems in place,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can have these checks and balances
built into your operations, to make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that you've minimized risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, what an appraiser or what an
investor is going to look at is the
[SPEAKER_03]: quality of management.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care what industry you're in,
that's probably the single most important
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as you look to build or expand or
partner with other companies or you bring
[SPEAKER_03]: in outside people to help build your
business, as Elaine alluded to earlier,
[SPEAKER_03]: something that she does is does due
diligence on people, due diligence on your
[SPEAKER_03]: suppliers, your wholesalers, whoever
you're in your chain of operations,
[SPEAKER_03]: just make sure you put forth the effort to
really research who it is that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: working with because that's something
that's going to be very important to a
[SPEAKER_03]: potential investor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I said, everything you can do to
have a low risk, well documented,
[SPEAKER_03]: well insulated infrastructure will behoove
you when you go to raise capital or sell
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's going to have a direct impact
on what you basically can achieve in the
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace for your asset.
[SPEAKER_06]: Showing you how devastating it can be if
you don't know who the people are and
[SPEAKER_06]: you're involved with your partners,
other management, etc.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a case recently where I was doing
an anti-money laundry review at a credit
[SPEAKER_06]: union in California that was going to bank
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were talking about whether or not
they had actually terminated any clients
[SPEAKER_06]: recently.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said yes, they had had two
gentlemen come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a partnership of three people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two people had come in recently and they
said they were completely just ashen faced
[SPEAKER_06]: and they were just so downtrodden and they
said we had to come in and tell you
[SPEAKER_06]: personally that we just found out our
third partner had been sanctioned by the
[SPEAKER_06]: SEC.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they knew exactly what was going to
happen which was their account.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were one of the few people that was
lucky enough to actually have an account
[SPEAKER_06]: in a bank.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the account was, you know,
they realized what was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: The account was closed and they were back
to zero.
[SPEAKER_06]: All because even though they were partners
in a business, they hadn't looked closely
[SPEAKER_06]: enough at each other to figure out what
their prior histories had been and whether
[SPEAKER_06]: or not that was going to impact the
business.
[SPEAKER_06]: And boy did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So turning to you, Matt, you're the one
person who has very hands-on experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you, and I also know that you're very
familiar with a lot of these systems
[SPEAKER_06]: because you and I have talked about seed
to sales tracking systems which was a
[SPEAKER_06]: good.
[SPEAKER_06]: How important that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you talk to us a little bit about the
concrete steps that you tell people to
[SPEAKER_06]: take and that Chiron has taken to protect
the company?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I guess the other two points I'd
like you to make are one about diversion
[SPEAKER_06]: because obviously that was your history at
the DEA.
[SPEAKER_06]: You were a diversion expert and how you
help people deal with that in their
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course we need to hear from you on
the whole schedule one to schedule five
[SPEAKER_06]: for CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a whole mouthful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have something for you to take on?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I can handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to talk a little bit about my
background, as Elaine mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent over 25 years as a special agent
with the Drug Enforcement Administration
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll just answer the question you're
all thinking because I get it all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how did you end up a DEA agent in this
space?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really been a pretty seamless and
easy transition for me because part of my
[SPEAKER_02]: job responsibilities back in the day,
if you will, was at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_02]: opioid epidemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on the front lines of shutting down
first internet pharmacies where people
[SPEAKER_02]: could go online and order a prescription
drug by Googling hydrocodone without a
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: Websites would come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would order a Vicodin and they
basically filled out an online
[SPEAKER_02]: questionnaire that would be sent to some
doctor who could be sitting on a boat in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Bahamas who would just hit click,
click, yeah, approve, approve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happened was that would be sent
to an online pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them were in Florida that would
just fill prescriptions and send them out
[SPEAKER_02]: FedEx, UPS, all over the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Ryan Haidt Act was passed that
mandated a face-to-face doctor-patient
[SPEAKER_02]: visit before a prescription for an opiate
could be issued.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason I bring that up is because
that was the early stages of the opioid
[SPEAKER_02]: epidemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at headquarters at the time and
worked with a guy named Joe Ranzese.
[SPEAKER_02]: 60 Minutes did a big report about that
because of things that happened that
[SPEAKER_02]: shouldn't happen, but when pain clinics or
internet pharmacies were outlawed,
[SPEAKER_02]: pain clinics became the norm because they
had a doctor on site and then this issue
[SPEAKER_02]: just got worse and worse and worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when 60 Minutes did their piece,
I was interviewed as well and was on
[SPEAKER_02]: camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happened over the years is I've
determined and believe, which I've heard
[SPEAKER_02]: much talk of here today, which I'm happy
to hear that I believe and many others do
[SPEAKER_02]: as well, that medical cannabis can be an
alternative to opioids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody in this country, I'm sure
everybody in this room knows somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: who's been touched by the opioid epidemic,
whether it's a friend of your child or
[SPEAKER_02]: friends of yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Opioids, and again, I've been there,
opioids as far as I'm concerned are bad
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs and they're dangerous and they're
addictive and people die.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, medical cannabis I believe
is a good alternative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've written articles about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as my work with Chiron,
I was approached by another agent that I
[SPEAKER_02]: worked with Chiron's a company that is the
first seed to sale medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: company to be operating in Columbia and
Columbia legalized medical cannabis about
[SPEAKER_02]: a year ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was recruited by Chiron to come in
and stand up their compliance and
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory division and what I've done is
brought basically DEA's rules and
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations as it pertains to regulating
the pharma industry for controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: substances to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I think that's important for
the folks in this room is because as
[SPEAKER_02]: Elaine mentioned yesterday, I'm sure many
of you know, maybe some of you don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: DEA rescheduled CBD oil from a schedule
one to a schedule five controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: substance, which means that the code of
federal regulations that are enforced by
[SPEAKER_02]: DEA as it pertains to controlled
substances will now be applied to CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think and I've thought for a long
time that that is just basically the start
[SPEAKER_02]: of prohibition ending as we, you know,
CBD oil which has a very low THC obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: for any THC content at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So FDA has already done so as far as
rescheduled.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that this is how this
prohibition ending will evolve from CBD
oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: To that medical cannabis and we'll see
where it goes from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when that happens, I think the DEA will
take over regulatory for the industry at
[SPEAKER_02]: some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that could be a big leap for me to
say, but I do believe that the same
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations that are applied now to
controlled substances for pharma companies
[SPEAKER_02]: will be applied to the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good thing about that is it'll bring
consistent regulation to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of in Oregon where maybe it's
the alcohol commission, those folks that
[SPEAKER_02]: were here earlier and other states where
you have, it's the Department of Health or
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever it is that regulates the industry
in every state, it's regulated a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the industry evolves and the
government evolves and prohibition ends,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll see consistent regulation I think
throughout the industry, which I think
[SPEAKER_02]: will be a really good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the folks mentioned on the panels
prior that saving the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: it sounds like saving the industry in the
state means that you need to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: export to other states and maybe other
countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, consistent regulation and
prohibition ending is gonna bring that a
[SPEAKER_02]: long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the due diligence, we apply the
due diligence standards that are in the
[SPEAKER_02]: CFR to our regulations in Chiron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed to sale, and technology that can
advance and monitor seed to sale is very
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Serialization, technology, very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are software companies out there
that you may, I'm not sure if in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're mandated to use one company for
reporting to the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the case here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which company do you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metric, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some states use BioTrack THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a company that we're familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of that has to do with
both compliance to prevent detective
[SPEAKER_02]: version, but it's also, I think,
for tax purposes for reporting so that
[SPEAKER_02]: they can tax the growers and what not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But operating in Columbia is a very unique
and creates circumstances very specific to
[SPEAKER_02]: the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that the same methodology can
be applied anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're starting a company from
scratch, building a grow operation on the
[SPEAKER_02]: equator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, because of Columbia being a
narco state in the past, with people like
[SPEAKER_02]: Pablo Escobar and kingpins and cartels,
it presents a very unique set of
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges for us that you may not have
here in the United States, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're a different society.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you drill down into what it takes
to operate a successful regulated
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, the same challenges apply in
Columbia or anywhere in Latin America or
[SPEAKER_02]: South America that apply here in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as Elaine mentioned and my colleagues
mentioned here, the due diligence is about
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing your customer, knowing your
suppliers, knowing your vendors,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that due diligence on those folks to
ensure that they're not involved in
[SPEAKER_02]: activity that may bring adverse action
against your license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's very important to know the
people that you're in business with
[SPEAKER_02]: because that can lead to big problems for
you in your operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as another gentleman on the panel
previously said, asking for forgiveness is
[SPEAKER_02]: not an option.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important, whether it's your sea
to sail technology or it's knowing your
[SPEAKER_02]: vendors and suppliers that everybody is
well vetted and you're doing business with
[SPEAKER_02]: people who are legitimate as opposed to
gray market or black market folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I cover almost everything?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you got there, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bernard, what would you say was the
biggest legal mistake people make in terms
[SPEAKER_06]: of getting their cannabis businesses
going?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen indications now that litigation
is beginning where partners may have
[SPEAKER_06]: started off with a handshake and then as
the business grows they begin to fight and
[SPEAKER_06]: then there's no contract or no corporate
bylaws, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you seeing that begins to trip up
companies and cause them the most grief?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would actually be an interesting
question to poll lawyers working with the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my case and I think with a lot of the
number of the attorneys I work more
[SPEAKER_00]: closely with,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of failure to formalize what are
in essence legal relationships is very
[SPEAKER_00]: high on the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think often times there's a reluctance
to go down the path of I guess reviewing
[SPEAKER_00]: all the ways you maintain a business
relationship with someone, whether it be a
[SPEAKER_00]: supplier or a service provider or whatever
or quite likely a business partner and
[SPEAKER_00]: going down that path of identifying those
areas where maybe you don't maybe see eye
[SPEAKER_00]: to eye or maybe one of you wants one thing
and the other one wants something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there can be both a learning
curve as business people become familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with concepts like formal contracts but
also maybe a reluctance to have some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the I guess more pointed discussions that
you need to have on the front end and then
[SPEAKER_00]: of course over time if you don't have a
document that you and your business
[SPEAKER_00]: partners or you and another person or
business can refer to to figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: the rules are and what the deal is,
then the relationship can start to drift
[SPEAKER_00]: and just like personal relationships,
unless there's kind of an effort at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point to kind of bring things back in line
with an arrangement that works for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone, then you can have those very
expensive issues where a healthy business
[SPEAKER_00]: is maybe damaged or maybe needs to be
liquidated because some of the key owners
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't getting along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just want to add to that because
that's a really great point and my
[SPEAKER_03]: practice does a lot of litigation support
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do a lot of valuations economic
damages work in the context of litigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say one of the number one reasons that
you see people in litigation around value
[SPEAKER_03]: of businesses is that the shareholder
agreement or wherever the operating
[SPEAKER_03]: agreement was that was constructed was
poorly written and poorly executed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every business is either going to be sold
or it's going to liquidate at some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not really any other outcome for a
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So putting forth the initial effort in the
beginning to really make sure you define
[SPEAKER_03]: terms around value and ownership and what
happens upon different exit scenarios,
[SPEAKER_03]: what happens upon an owner's death,
what happens upon a shareholder dispute of
[SPEAKER_03]: one type or another is critical because
I'd say no exaggeration, 50% of the
[SPEAKER_03]: litigation work I see is due to poor
agreements and there's a falling out
[SPEAKER_03]: between business partners and then there's
a fight because it wasn't clearly spelled
[SPEAKER_03]: out how the shares or how the interest the
units in an LLC for example should be
[SPEAKER_03]: valued and it creates massive headaches
super expensive and it's you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but so just to your point I mean making
sure those agreements are in place and
[SPEAKER_03]: really well thought out and terms are
defined like is it you know fair market
[SPEAKER_03]: value?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have consideration of shareholder
discounts, minority level discounts,
[SPEAKER_03]: discounts for lack of marketability?
[SPEAKER_03]: All these terms that appraisers use every
day obviously most business people aren't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily familiar with them,
but just think about you know that
[SPEAKER_03]: question of value and what happens upon
some sort of exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay and just because tax is kind of my
area I will without getting technical
[SPEAKER_00]: observe that a common result of maybe
being slow to address tax issues maybe in
[SPEAKER_00]: part because we as individuals you know we
kind of think about tax once or twice a
[SPEAKER_00]: year as April 15th approaches and then
maybe as the extended deadline approaches,
[SPEAKER_00]: if someone's running a business say for a
year or 18 months dealing with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: complexity and so on and hard work that's
involved, if they're not addressing tax
[SPEAKER_00]: issues almost in real time kind of on a
monthly or maybe quarterly basis which can
[SPEAKER_00]: require maybe being a little bit forceful
with one's CPA who might be used to
[SPEAKER_00]: clients that think about these things once
a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't do that then you the company
can maybe just be starting to become
[SPEAKER_00]: established you know maybe some people in
the business are starting to feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're hitting their stride a bit and
then you get to tax return time,
[SPEAKER_00]: March, April, whatever and then you
suddenly realize you have a $200,000 debt
[SPEAKER_00]: that you didn't know you had before and
maybe you just made a business decision
[SPEAKER_00]: two months earlier you know maybe you just
entered into a deal based on the idea that
[SPEAKER_00]: you thought you had $200,000 that maybe
now you realize you don't have or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of issue flows through to a
risk-averse investor so then at that point
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting the email or the phone call
from the investor after they just had a
[SPEAKER_00]: very tense and uncomfortable discussion
with their CPA or maybe their spouse and
[SPEAKER_00]: that addressing these issues that type of
issue on the front end can be helpful but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very common that people aren't able
to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are either of you seeing any intellectual
property problems coming up and maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: resulting in litigation?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen bits here and there but I don't
know if you've dealt with those yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're coming for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah they're coming, they're coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't dealt specifically with that
issue yet but I've been reading it you
[SPEAKER_03]: know obviously it's being discussed and
the IP valuations in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_03]: are you know are very significant and
there's a ton of a lot of these operations
[SPEAKER_03]: or businesses the value really is in you
know the IP whether it be a license or you
[SPEAKER_03]: know trying to a brand, a trademark,
any sort of process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean there are patents being issued and
I think there's gonna be litigation coming
[SPEAKER_03]: from you know claims of patent
infringement but to answer your question I
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't done anything specifically in that
space but I believe it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lincoln do you have any thoughts on what
businesses can do to identify IP that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be worth protecting or going to
be valuable when they get to a point of
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially selling the business?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I mean I think that's you know I
think if you have if you're let's say it's
[SPEAKER_03]: a product or a brand that's getting that's
driving value I mean certainly you can
[SPEAKER_03]: always you know have someone look at that
question for you and certainly IP is
[SPEAKER_03]: valued every day and you look at a
business and you kind of allocate value
[SPEAKER_03]: from the different assets in that business
one of those assets key categories is
[SPEAKER_03]: intangibles which covers you know patent
and IP and other intangibles but you know
[SPEAKER_03]: if you believe you have something of value
that is not a tangible asset there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: reason why you're able to generate returns
or earnings it's a good chance it could be
[SPEAKER_03]: in an intangible asset having that
identified and patented or trademarks
[SPEAKER_03]: licensed in some way secures that that
becomes transferable that asset now can be
[SPEAKER_03]: transferred to a buyer without that sort
of recognition or trademark or legal
[SPEAKER_03]: protection a buyer is not going to pay you
anything for it because there's no there's
[SPEAKER_03]: no guarantee that they'll be able to
maintain the value of that asset so I just
[SPEAKER_03]: you know if you think that you have a
business that has intangible value and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're thinking about you know bringing in
outside investors or an exit scenario it
[SPEAKER_03]: behooves you to have someone help you
understand look at that and quantify that
[SPEAKER_03]: and then talk about with an attorney
obviously you know how to license it how
[SPEAKER_03]: to protect it because you know a lot of
businesses large percentage of the value
[SPEAKER_06]: is locked up in that that intangible value
Matt what I know you do some reviews of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis businesses for operational and
security problems what sort of things do
[SPEAKER_06]: you find that people overlook in those
situations that cause them problems on
[SPEAKER_02]: those two fronts security and
record-keeping are probably to the the
[SPEAKER_02]: main issues I think that that can get
folks in trouble in regards to compliance
[SPEAKER_02]: and reporting but depending on whether
it's a dispensary a grow operation or what
[SPEAKER_02]: your business operation entails we like to
look at cannabis operations the way you
[SPEAKER_02]: would probably fortify in the US a bank
with CCTV coverage and I'm sure that in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon there are certain criteria that are
mandated by the state I know the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations are onerous and as far as the
the CCTV biometrics for employees is very
[SPEAKER_02]: important I know somebody mentioned
earlier about background investigations on
[SPEAKER_02]: employees and ensuring that they they
don't have any felony drug arrests is is
[SPEAKER_02]: important diversion as it pertains to
employee theft and loss is very important
[SPEAKER_02]: we we through the through the technology
that's available that we're utilizing and
[SPEAKER_02]: tracking and tracing you know from sea to
sail you know it's important to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: put your your fingers on a plant at any
time during the production chain during
[SPEAKER_02]: the supply chain as it moves as it moves
through the growth process so protecting
[SPEAKER_02]: the operation from outside infiltration is
obviously very important as is employee
[SPEAKER_02]: theft and diversion and I think that you
know obviously this industry is is very
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a new industry it's evolving and
credibility and legitimacy are very
[SPEAKER_02]: important as we move forward so that the
folks that are the naysayers out there
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have a leg to stand on in regards to
your operation and being legitimate
[SPEAKER_02]: credible good neighbors good in the
community that you're working within is
[SPEAKER_02]: very important because right now they're I
think they're they're believers and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're a naysayers just like anything
else so I think that it behooves everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: to to be good corporate citizens and be
good neighbors and to make sure that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have the most robust security and
compliance program that you can both to
[SPEAKER_02]: protect your own license and of course to
prevent that diversion and loss from
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring as well Matt I know a good
number of businesses out there and some
[SPEAKER_00]: some some businesses that that I'm
familiar with have had these issues arrive
[SPEAKER_00]: arise where they discover the diversion
issue or they discover something about a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular employee or business associate
do you have any thoughts on how best to
[SPEAKER_02]: move forward with those situations when
they come to light I think you know if you
[SPEAKER_02]: have an employee that's stealing first
thing you need to do is terminate that
[SPEAKER_02]: employee obviously and depending on on the
scale of the diversion and the theft you
[SPEAKER_02]: would want to notify the authorities
regulatory agency I think that if you just
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is how it worked with the farm
industry as well if you determine the
[SPEAKER_02]: diversions taking place before they do
that's much better than being told by an
[SPEAKER_02]: outside entity that you have a problem
within it's going to be a lot worse for
[SPEAKER_02]: your operation if a regulator finds a
problem that you didn't know existed and
[SPEAKER_02]: that happens in the farm industry all the
time and it's not good when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: fines and adverse actions against their
DEA registration so if you have an issue
[SPEAKER_02]: within your operation and you can talk to
the regulators and bring it to their
[SPEAKER_02]: attention say hey this is what happened
but we dealt with it and this person you
[SPEAKER_02]: know we notified local authorities persons
been terminated and of course being able
[SPEAKER_02]: to determine exactly what that looked like
from a theft and loss perspective
[SPEAKER_02]: reporting it should put you in a good
place as far as we're how you're viewed by
[SPEAKER_02]: that authority as opposed to them coming
in finding there's something wrong and
[SPEAKER_02]: something missing and things are missing
now you have to find out which employee
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a problem with and then of course
you could be dealing with significant
[SPEAKER_02]: issues against your license and so it's
always better to be ahead of that I would
[SPEAKER_02]: say and that's about due diligence about
doing audits about inventories and
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully that you know the software tools
that you use will assist you greatly and
[SPEAKER_05]: that aren't you taking I think about time
for about one more comment we're running
[SPEAKER_00]: out of time sure just this is sort of a
lawyer comment the in a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: situations in a lot of situations where
people discover employee theft or really
[SPEAKER_00]: any number of I guess anxiety producing
scenarios which the industry is familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with given its history it's it can be very
important to take a deep breath I think in
[SPEAKER_00]: my view and to meet meet with your
attorney or at the very least kind of have
[SPEAKER_00]: an internal sit-down within an
organization and discussion but meet with
[SPEAKER_00]: but meet with an attorney and kind of talk
through what's going on and the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: implications and start to figure out how
to address it in kind of a methodical way
[SPEAKER_00]: and the reason I say that is because so
often it seems like these these situations
[SPEAKER_00]: arise and then because a company or an
individual takes sort of an iterative
[SPEAKER_00]: approach you know maybe having a having a
discussion amongst the people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: company other than the person that is is a
bad actor and and then maybe only later
[SPEAKER_00]: than having a discussion with them and
then being undecided as to whether there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a way to remove that person from the
company because of these these kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: iterative approaches and maybe even a bit
maybe a little bit too much of a focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the authorities going to do if
when they find out because of that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: end up with a scenario where it looks
worse than it is or it looks like maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: more people in the company were involved
in the bad acts then then really then
[SPEAKER_00]: really it should and really it needs to
all right I think with that we're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: have to wrap it up could we have one
question we have one question and then
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll wrap it up let's hear it again for
the whole panel everybody I my name is
[SPEAKER_01]: Roberto Robles I'm from Oregon I do
transportation policy and audit work and
[SPEAKER_01]: what we found in the state of Oregon after
the Columbia River crossing debacle when
[SPEAKER_01]: we dropped the ball on building a new
bridge to Washington because their data
[SPEAKER_01]: modeling systems were inaccurate so I want
to ask you guys to put on your risk audit
[SPEAKER_01]: policy hats and look at the cannabis
systems at the OLCC and are there going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be any hidden skeletons in data accuracy
data transitions for how we manage those
[SPEAKER_01]: data systems because right now we could be
exporting our knowledge we can't export
[SPEAKER_01]: flour but we can export our knowledge and
so I'm really concerned about the state of
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon's ability to manage these databases
well we do have experts that are data
[SPEAKER_06]: analytic experts that look at that sort of
thing and figure out where data is going
[SPEAKER_06]: and what you've got there but it's a very
technical question and probably not one we
[SPEAKER_00]: can answer fully at this point one of my
colleagues from emerges is here that might
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to speak to some specific specific
issues there so I'd be happy to introduce
[SPEAKER_04]: you great thank you let's hear it again
for Elaine Carey and the rest of the panel
[SPEAKER_04]: that's FTI consulting I'm sure they'd be
happy to talk with you more outside the
[SPEAKER_04]: halls and once again let's hear for
Anthony you you you you you
