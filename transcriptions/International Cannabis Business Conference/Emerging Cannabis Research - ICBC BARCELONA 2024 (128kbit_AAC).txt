[SPEAKER_05]: All right, what's up Barcelona?
[SPEAKER_05]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so you guys have been outside already
I see All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well have an excellent panel here today
We're gonna be talking about research
[SPEAKER_05]: advancements and some of the emerging
research that's been going on with these
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome panelists who all let them
introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't we start with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much everyone for coming
Thank you very much for the organization
[SPEAKER_01]: to invite me to this amazing event.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Alberto Science I'm from Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm based in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need any recommendations later,
you can hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem So my background is in
psychology and neuroscience and I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: working for the cannabis industry for the
last 10 years I'm a clinical and
[SPEAKER_01]: behavioral scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing research on how cannabis
affects the brain and how the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_01]: potential of cannabis can actually work on
humans so Through my work in the academia
[SPEAKER_01]: and the work on the industry we are trying
to find if cannabis is actually Helping
[SPEAKER_01]: patients to treat their diseases to treat
this their symptoms for this I work for 10
[SPEAKER_01]: year for eight years in a greenhouse
company that had a medical branch and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was doing research from biomedical to
clinical like from in vitro studies to
[SPEAKER_01]: human studies also with animal studies and
For the last two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working as a consultant In a company
that is called the Broughton group from
[SPEAKER_01]: the UK and we help Companies to put their
products on the market mostly vaporizers
[SPEAKER_01]: from the nicotine cannabis and pharma
industry So I think I'm really looking
[SPEAKER_01]: forward for this conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's gonna be a really good one
I'll let him introduce himself now.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon I'm very happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank the organization for the
invitation to be in this panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Swiss watch I'm founder and CEO
of para lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a company based in Portugal and
Spain we have a mix of distribution of
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory analytical and process
instrumentation for initially for many
[SPEAKER_02]: years for over 40 years on the
pharmaceutical industry and we did
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting legalization of medical cannabis
production and processing in Portugal in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2018 We were brought to these to these to
these fields extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been always One of our main topics
in our business either manufacturing
[SPEAKER_02]: systems either distributing more higher
capacity systems to But over these years
[SPEAKER_02]: by request of our customers somehow we
expanded also For the post harvest so
[SPEAKER_02]: bucking trimming and so on so we can say
that From the moment you cut you harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been present One of our big
concerns it has always been because in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe until now it has been medical
cannabis So we have to follow you GMP
[SPEAKER_02]: guidelines to make sure that solutions
were compliant with these guidelines and
[SPEAKER_02]: also to optimize the processes most
specially on extraction and on
[SPEAKER_02]: purification where we see that the
knowledge that There is for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't allow yet to take these processes
many of processes on extraction of
[SPEAKER_02]: purification to the most efficient level
to the most efficient and also according
[SPEAKER_02]: to the guidelines consistent products with
purities and Basically to assure that the
[SPEAKER_02]: product is a safe product for the
consumers medical cannabis very cool
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see everybody here.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Justin Tom B I am here on
behalf of the Talman group as we sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: lead Efforts to upgrade research and
development activities here in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry both in Europe and
globally to more professional standards
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from Oregon originally My background
is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up in the culture I've been
involved in sort of every stage of the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry's development from pre-medical to
medical to recreational to hemp at scale I
[SPEAKER_04]: helped found and lead a hemp breeding
company by the name of phytonics where we
[SPEAKER_04]: did genomic cross indexing of phenotypes
and genotypes to different cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: profiles and then different cultivation
methodologies and produce lines and
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties of hemp for different
application I've also had a background at
[SPEAKER_04]: one point in a R&D tech incubator for
non-thermal plasma technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know the value of good R&D good data
management and good practices and
[SPEAKER_04]: methodology a lot of which has been
missing in cannabis research over the
[SPEAKER_04]: years because of various biases and and
lack of basic supporting context and
[SPEAKER_04]: information So our goal here is to kind of
elevate the conversation about what Makes
[SPEAKER_04]: good research in the cannabis space and
how we can get there and I'm looking
[SPEAKER_05]: forward to this conversation Awesome,
and then my friend from Slovenia Hello
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody, I'm Božida Radicević.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming from Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am founder and project manager of
Research Nature Institute We are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting Slovenian and international
patients with the quality control of their
[SPEAKER_00]: products now for last nine years,
I think And later on this was the first
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also starting to organize education for
doctors and nurses because we realized
[SPEAKER_00]: that if Doctors are not educated cannabis
will never be a part of the medical system
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's the most important issue
and I hope that industry will you know
[SPEAKER_00]: accept that and maybe support More
research like the pharma industry do But
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is very special and The field so
I hope that the industry will see that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really necessary other things that we
are doing Because I was also in jail
[SPEAKER_00]: because of cannabis we started to make
this legalization or regulation process in
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia which in last two three years
also with help of the German group who
[SPEAKER_00]: made the big leaps in Slovenia and I hope
That we will be the next country following
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany soon Very cool round of applause
for our panelists.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna get this thing started and
Thank you, and my name is Alex Revich.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from Canada started in 2013 in the
legal industry which ten years in the
[SPEAKER_05]: legal industry feels like a hundred years
sometimes and I've been helping with ICBC
[SPEAKER_05]: since the first one in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we'll see you there And excited
to be talking with these great panelists
[SPEAKER_05]: about research and the first thing we want
to talk about is Why is the research so
[SPEAKER_05]: important?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean we touched on it a little bit and
maybe we'll start with you since you kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of touched on it You know, why is research
so important?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why why do we need to even be doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course the research is most important
that the professionals get to know enough
[SPEAKER_00]: usable data To bring the cannabis into
mainstream medicine Actually cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: the most research plan on the planet with
over 150,000 published studies but still
[SPEAKER_00]: the the doctors or the professionals they
don't have any Protocols they don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: actually any any Base to prescribe
cannabis at least in Slovenia Cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: last 70 years was mentioned just in a bad
connotation not as a medicine and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: this 70 years All propaganda still ongoing
made a big damage and this is what we want
[SPEAKER_04]: to turn over Why else is research so
important any other thoughts So I think
[SPEAKER_04]: research is always important in that it
generates Knowledge and data that can be
[SPEAKER_04]: used in practical application,
but it's dependent on the methodology of
[SPEAKER_04]: the research, right so you can conduct
studies with sort of narrow scope and Kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of preset biases about what your outcomes
are likely to be or you can also conduct
[SPEAKER_04]: research without necessary context and
those are going to predispose your results
[SPEAKER_04]: to To limited application.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things that's happening now
is we're looking at sort of a wider range
[SPEAKER_04]: of how we can carry research out that
certainly wasn't a lot before in and I
[SPEAKER_04]: think that the the outcome of having more
data Available is that then there's more
[SPEAKER_04]: specific specificity and more
effectiveness in application and whether
[SPEAKER_04]: that's medical right and whether we're
talking about the use of Cannabinoids is
[SPEAKER_04]: agonist for CB and one and two receptors
that reduce cell proliferation and Tumor
[SPEAKER_04]: formation for glioblastoma, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very specific, but then which
cannabinoids in which ratios?
[SPEAKER_04]: In which clinical settings are going to be
most effective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, okay have we addressed that or if
we're talking about the use of You know
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis fibers in electrophoresis for
substrates for super capacitors and energy
[SPEAKER_04]: storage these are really different,
but the the the level of Background
[SPEAKER_04]: contextual information the openness to
different outcomes and the methodology
[SPEAKER_04]: used will definitely Influence what the
the result is and that's what we really
[SPEAKER_04]: want is we want good results to guide good
decision-making So we have to have high
[SPEAKER_04]: quality research to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a good point and we were
backstage We were talking about the
[SPEAKER_05]: importance around education.
[SPEAKER_05]: We hear doctors all the time saying oh,
there's not enough research and we don't
[SPEAKER_05]: know enough research Well, you know,
how do they get this research because
[SPEAKER_05]: there is a lot of research out there but
Sometimes they don't really make too much
[SPEAKER_05]: of an effort to go out of their way And
maybe it's because the pharma companies
[SPEAKER_05]: are are so in their face with all their
research You know, what can we do better
[SPEAKER_05]: to make sure that the doctors are learning
about this research because it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: important Well First point is we have the
research because research gives you
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge But it's also the way you do
this research if we want doctors to start
[SPEAKER_02]: prescribing Cannabis we have to do
research with Statistical relevance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that Ideally, this would be
like farm away, you know with clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: studies and so on but this takes many
years and tens hundreds of millions,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the studies have to have Statistical
relevance then with this data is
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely necessary as to start educating
the doctors And it is I think not one
[SPEAKER_02]: Magical solution for everything different
countries have different realities Maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: even legal requirements, but it's
absolutely necessary to create I think
[SPEAKER_02]: Courses it's not just making like a
Congress I talking about Portugal where I
[SPEAKER_02]: come there is one or two meetings per year
About medical cannabis in which doctors
[SPEAKER_02]: are invited but after these two meetings
doctors go home and they forget either if
[SPEAKER_02]: there isn't a specialization few weeks
Ideally some mouth specialization training
[SPEAKER_02]: that doctors can attend There will never
be doctors that will be really Willing or
[SPEAKER_02]: a big number of doctors that is really
willing to start describing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a main issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need Specialization courses on cannabis
how long it will depend but is not with
[SPEAKER_02]: meetings Congresses you need this strength
this this discourse Now depending and
[SPEAKER_02]: again with with the Portuguese reality We
should strive to have the doctors
[SPEAKER_02]: Association blessing Because without these
doctors session blessing there will be
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah by just by happening there will be a
Doctors start describing by being
[SPEAKER_02]: evangelized it understanding the benefits
of the medical cannabis but to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: major major impact than It comes with
lobbying also it depends what is
[SPEAKER_02]: stakeholder Maybe sometimes is the
government in Portugal is not so much dog
[SPEAKER_02]: to the government But exactly these
medical association that they have to give
[SPEAKER_02]: the blessing to these courses So that then
the doctors win without fear of any
[SPEAKER_02]: lawsuit or liability That they can start
describing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good point Alberto.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah to me is quite clear that we need
research to understand exactly how
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis affects the body and and the
therapeutic potential of of this plant we
[SPEAKER_01]: need to know exactly if these treatments
are safe and we also need to investigate
[SPEAKER_01]: the efficacy of these treatments and
Obviously we need to train the doctors so
[SPEAKER_01]: they can understand when they can
prescribe these but The evidence that we
[SPEAKER_01]: are creating at the moment is only
clinical evidence and clinical evidence
[SPEAKER_01]: cost a lot of money and a clinical trial
cost millions of euros and Not everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: is able to spend that money to create that
evidence that doctors may need In the
[SPEAKER_01]: other hand, we also have what is called
the real-world evidence that these types
[SPEAKER_01]: of studies are observational studies that
can still be run by doctors so we can
[SPEAKER_01]: train the doctors to collect the feedback
data from the patients and use that data
[SPEAKER_01]: to create that evidence to understand how
cannabis can really help to certain
[SPEAKER_01]: medical conditions and That knowledge will
come back to the doctors to understand how
[SPEAKER_01]: it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we not we don't only need to Train the
doctors on how they can Use cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: the patients, but we also have to train
them to collect data so we can make the
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence Larger we can we can create more
evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know exactly how cannabis works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great point Justin Yeah, I just wanted to
add real quickly to what Alberto was
[SPEAKER_04]: saying a real-world example John Hopkins
University is launching in this year a
[SPEAKER_04]: study of a large cohort of 10,000 patients
who are engaging What they call from a
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis naive position.
[SPEAKER_04]: So their first time to begin using
cannabis medically And they're they're
[SPEAKER_04]: working with a nonprofit out of Colorado
called the realm for caring they got a 10
[SPEAKER_04]: million dollar grant from the federal
government and they're tracking the
[SPEAKER_04]: Variety of different health indicators and
metrics over a minimum of the first year
[SPEAKER_04]: frequent Check-ins to begin with later
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're looking at They're looking at
dosage.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're looking at cannabinoid ratios.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're looking across these wide range of
again health indicators to create kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: adaptive database About a bunch of
different therapeutic uses and then that
[SPEAKER_04]: would be an aggregate form of data that it
back to Alberto's point could be utilized
[SPEAKER_04]: to better inform and train doctors about
how Cannabis use and all these different
[SPEAKER_04]: contexts effects, you know interactions
with other drugs different health outcomes
[SPEAKER_04]: things like that so Having the the
research and the data on one side and then
[SPEAKER_04]: having that accessible to the health care
professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important I just want to add
something, you know Until the cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system will not be the
part of curriculum in the schools and
[SPEAKER_00]: Universities we have done nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are just throwing a little bit of water
into big fire and There will be no
[SPEAKER_00]: success, you know, that's the point and if
we start to educate those people today It
[SPEAKER_00]: will be available in ten years when we
have first generation of you know informed
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians That's excellent point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you applaud that for sure To touch
on therapeutic benefits of these
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids, you know in Canada We have a
lot of CBG CBN products that getting a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of talk and I hate when people say that's
a new cannabinoid They're not new
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: These cannabinoids have been there the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just never really knew anything about
them But it's creating a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: excitement.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like my own my mom is taking CBN gummies
And I was joking with you that she used to
[SPEAKER_05]: yell at me that cannabis is ruining my
life and now she's taking it And she's
[SPEAKER_05]: telling her friends about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're starting to see a lot of these cool
new therapeutic Cannabinoids without
[SPEAKER_05]: really any of the research and I wanted to
see from the panelists What other exciting
[SPEAKER_05]: things are you seeing on the research side
that you're excited about on the
[SPEAKER_05]: therapeutic advancements?
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything you'd like to talk about anything
specific that you're excited about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah from my side well I'm really looking
forward for the data of what I was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: before of the real-world evidence like the
job Hopkins Study that is being done and
[SPEAKER_01]: also and there is a program in the UK that
is called 2021 That they're also
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting a lot of feedback from
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what's gonna change
everything once we know exactly what works
[SPEAKER_01]: and for what and for which medical
conditions from the real experience of the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients I'm really looking forward for
that and in the other hand well One of the
[SPEAKER_01]: studies that I'm gonna start soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also the psychopharmacology of minor
cannabinoids to see how CBDB Can affect
[SPEAKER_01]: the brain?
[SPEAKER_01]: CBC CBN CBG but from from a clinical
perspective It would be kind of a clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trial to see the psychopharmacology of
minor cannabinoids so it's something that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also looking forward for that and in
general what I want to see is more
[SPEAKER_01]: research on minor cannabinoids and well
done research because what There's not
[SPEAKER_01]: enough funds to do all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We I think it will be also interesting to
get Public funds to do these things
[SPEAKER_01]: because otherwise the only ones that could
do this research would be the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical industry and the
pharmaceutical industry I think it plays a
[SPEAKER_01]: role here and it can be important to
Because obviously they they they put in
[SPEAKER_01]: resources to do research But we have to
find also other ways to do research that
[SPEAKER_01]: can benefit to also small smaller
companies and obviously the academia This
[SPEAKER_02]: is not much my area but some things I'm
going and seeing and reading it was very
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting seeing some studies recent
research in autism treatment with CBTV and
[SPEAKER_02]: diabetes even although it's not a critical
disease much as the others with JCV but we
[SPEAKER_02]: are talking here about the research for
the patients but and you're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: minor cannabinoids and By minor then when
it comes to get them available I'd say
[SPEAKER_02]: next tracks becomes really expensive and
complicated to get these and so increasing
[SPEAKER_02]: the price of these cannabinoids and there
has been lots of research and nowadays is
[SPEAKER_02]: not even So uncommon to find flowers buds
with the plants producing high contents of
[SPEAKER_02]: THC visa THC V for instance is not anymore
a minor for those strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is other research happening That at
the end will be very relevant then for the
[SPEAKER_02]: application and these cannabinoids for the
therapeutics that Doctors and researchers
[SPEAKER_02]: like Alberto are are finding for these
cannabinoids Sure, and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're seeing In terms of therapeutic
applications, yeah, I'll just put a brief
[SPEAKER_04]: plug in for something that's a huge
problem for us in the US Due to some
[SPEAKER_04]: irresponsibility on the pharmaceutical
industry's part and the ineffectiveness of
[SPEAKER_04]: regulators.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a huge opioid dependency issue in
the US and The impact is significant can't
[SPEAKER_04]: be understated there has been research
done showing the benefits of cannabis use
[SPEAKER_04]: for adjunct treatments for opioid
dependency and in show market
[SPEAKER_04]: significantly Statistically significant
increases in efficacy of treatment north
[SPEAKER_04]: of 20% increase in the cannabis user
cohort as well as Decreased rates of
[SPEAKER_04]: recidivism.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's an area I'd like to just
highlight say it's a powerful way that
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis can help and something I'd like
to see more research in for sure You know
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis case, I think the pharma
industry and main mainstream research
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, let's put it that way they
Actually don't know how to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because they are mostly you
Looking for molecules for certain
[SPEAKER_00]: condition or disease But with cannabis is
other way around you have to adjust to
[SPEAKER_00]: your end the cannabinoid system and so on
So I think this is also the reason why You
[SPEAKER_00]: know now you Year before Was the THCV now
is CB and any CBG all those minor
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids but we never look into the
whole picture and how the Cannabis effect
[SPEAKER_00]: to end the cannabinoid system actually and
when we figure this out, it will be way
[SPEAKER_05]: easier Yeah, no excellent point and you
know something we were also talking
[SPEAKER_05]: Backstage is around the importance around
quality and innovation and technology Your
[SPEAKER_05]: research is only as good as the quality of
what you're researching I mean there was
[SPEAKER_05]: an example in Canada where someone was
doing some research and they found that
[SPEAKER_05]: the cannabis wasn't effective like people
were not getting good results and I said
[SPEAKER_05]: wait Where are you getting the cannabis
from and I won't mention the company name
[SPEAKER_05]: But the company product is terrible and
then it's like of course they're not
[SPEAKER_05]: getting good results They're getting like
hey, you know, this isn't cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were talking backstage about someone
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to open it up to questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if anyone has any questions get ready
for them, but talk about some
[SPEAKER_05]: breakthroughs You're seeing in your own
perspective areas that you are excited
[SPEAKER_05]: about that can actually help the research
side because without the product quality
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter the research that's
being done.
[SPEAKER_05]: So who wants to start us off?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Justin with the plants like,
you know, what's some of the research
[SPEAKER_05]: being done on the plants?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that the research on the patients is
benefited Yeah, well it all starts with
[SPEAKER_04]: the plants, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously from my background we we
start looking at you know, genotypes and
[SPEAKER_04]: and then Cultivating specific varieties
that can predispose plants to producing
[SPEAKER_04]: more or less of certain cannabinoids,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we want to emphasize THC VA as one
of the miners and the production of that
[SPEAKER_04]: we start looking at it genetically,
but it's not just A genetic expression,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have also all of the environmental or a
biotic epigenetic influences that change
[SPEAKER_04]: how the plant creates secondary
metabolites, so That means that you can
[SPEAKER_04]: change the light the color frequency
intensity of the light and that changes
[SPEAKER_04]: the Relative ratios of different kinds of
cannabinoids that are produced.
[SPEAKER_04]: So UVB light tends to drive THC and CBD
production there's been research that
[SPEAKER_04]: illustrates that whereas certain kinds of
LED lighting with a more full spectrum and
[SPEAKER_04]: lower intensity has been shown to get the
ratio of CBG To THC production down closer
[SPEAKER_04]: to one to two as opposed to one to sixteen
So that's an example of where you use
[SPEAKER_04]: something like a light spectrum to to
impact what the plants producing which
[SPEAKER_04]: will then relate to a feedstock product
for the Ultimately the patient I also
[SPEAKER_04]: think in terms of it's important to say on
the whole value chain beginning from the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant all the way up If you want good
medicine for people you have to treat the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole process with respect You can't just
be profit driven in this you can't look at
[SPEAKER_04]: the lowest cost inputs and have no
mindfulness about what chemicals you are
[SPEAKER_04]: using in the soil of the plants or the
extraction processes which solvents might
[SPEAKER_04]: be Left behind you really have to come at
this from respecting ultimately the the
[SPEAKER_04]: value of the life of the ecosystem the
plant itself and then the the patient
[SPEAKER_04]: that's ultimately going to use that so we
always advocate for highest standards of a
[SPEAKER_04]: practice in cultivation organics
biodynamics regenerative and you can kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of follow that up and that might be a
place where it's good for me to pass this
[SPEAKER_04]: over to Rui because I believe You know he
he's and I have had conversations speaking
[SPEAKER_04]: to the the importance of upholding those
same kind of standards when it comes to
[SPEAKER_04]: Extraction and processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's very important for sure One
of the main issues with extraction is that
[SPEAKER_02]: if you start with a bad flower low potency
flower You always get also extracts that
[SPEAKER_02]: are not very potent and with more
impurities If you want high quality
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts without going In over steps many
steps of purification in which you will
[SPEAKER_02]: end up also losing compounds that are of
interest You'd have to work always with
[SPEAKER_02]: high potency high quality flower nowadays
Based on co2 extraction but in different
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions of standard supercritical
conditions You are able independently of
[SPEAKER_02]: the potency of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be 5% potency can be 25% potency
You will always get extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say a full spectrum oil as first
Extract with potency is always over 80 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 85 So these are methods in which the
conditions of solvent is very very
[SPEAKER_02]: selective to cannabinoids This is why you
always get the high potencies even
[SPEAKER_02]: starting with plants with low potency This
is quite important because at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time using these technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also maintain high levels of
terpenes People always speak about full
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum oil, but what's a full spectrum
oil a full spectrum oil is an oil On an
[SPEAKER_02]: extract in which the chemistry of the
extracts is very similar to chemistry of
[SPEAKER_02]: the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So The ratios of cannabinoids are the same
on extract and in flower the ratios of
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes are the same in the extract and
in flower and the ratio between total
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids and total terpenes are the
same if Many extraction techniques will
[SPEAKER_02]: not keep these ratios So saying that you
have an full spectrum oil many times is
[SPEAKER_02]: just marketing is not the true full
spectrum Oil this kind of new technologies
[SPEAKER_02]: you get real full spectrum oils It also
makes life easier when you move them to
[SPEAKER_02]: distillates or even to isolates because in
these techniques you can opt to take the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes or 90% of terpenes out making
life of in terms of purification and
[SPEAKER_02]: ratification of the extract quite easier
This is a big impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good point And you know,
we like to joke that garbage in garbage
[SPEAKER_05]: out they expect to just take some garbage
product throw it in there And magic is
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if it was garbage before it's not
there's no magic formula that takes some
[SPEAKER_05]: garbage old stale cannabis and turns it
into To fire as we like to joke about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is even also Coming out to
extraction but for the production there
[SPEAKER_02]: are also developments this applies more
for indoor facilities indoor facilities
[SPEAKER_02]: usually Is seen that a way to produce
cannabis with less?
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination microbiological bio-burden
issues less microbes less bacteria less
[SPEAKER_02]: mold Nevertheless, even in indoor things
can go wrong and typically as these
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities age You end up having an
increased number of contaminations.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also nowadays new technologies
that allow you to so by working
[SPEAKER_02]: continually continuously 24-hour seven To
kill eliminate 98% of pathogens and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: in the air in surface water For ceilings,
but most especially on the surface of your
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So These will have you end up with a
flower that is far less contaminated Will
[SPEAKER_02]: not require treatments like irradiation
that always affect quality of flower It
[SPEAKER_05]: dries it up kills the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen any last thought Justin before
we open up for questions You just wanted
[SPEAKER_04]: to tag really quickly on the whole meta
picture of indoor cultivation versus
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse and outdoor as There is this
sort of view paradigm that in order to
[SPEAKER_04]: quality control and increase Purity and
security.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a drive to put things in indoor
conditions for cultivation and it's a it's
[SPEAKER_04]: a question worth really Evaluating in the
long term whether this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: I pose this for everybody to consider and
take home with them the energy intensity
[SPEAKER_04]: and cultivation the if we're talking about
things in terms of a co2 footprint or an
[SPEAKER_04]: energy consumption or environment Impact
of indoor systems and cultivation needs to
[SPEAKER_04]: really be looked at and in terms of what
we look at for purity and Whether there
[SPEAKER_04]: are biological contaminants microbial
contaminants part of that is a
[SPEAKER_04]: misunderstanding the thought that All
microbes need to be controlled is is a
[SPEAKER_04]: misunderstanding pathogens occur in the
absence of beneficial microorganisms and
[SPEAKER_04]: really understanding how to cultivate
Beneficial strong healthy robust micro
[SPEAKER_04]: Ecosystems in the soil and on the plant
then actually as a cultivator you can
[SPEAKER_04]: eliminate a lot of The potential for
pathogens the same thing in your
[SPEAKER_04]: processing Practices for curing and all
that so I want to just push back a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit against the assumption that you need
to create laboratory like aseptic
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions to grow and process your
Cannabis in order to have a high quality
[SPEAKER_04]: high purity healthy product And I think in
the larger context we need to examine
[SPEAKER_05]: those assumptions That's a good point and
you know, I think I think along that
[SPEAKER_05]: lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's around the consistency We want to
have a consistency so it's always the same
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean when we make our edibles people
think of edibles as recreational products
[SPEAKER_05]: But really they're an excellent meter dose
way of using cannabinoids You know smoking
[SPEAKER_05]: a joint and then doing research is a very
difficult thing because it's always so
[SPEAKER_05]: different but having some Metre dose and
also I work with a company called
[SPEAKER_05]: Zantrella which we were talking about
before where they have an EEG headband
[SPEAKER_05]: that measures brainwaves And tells you
when did you get high?
[SPEAKER_05]: How high did you get in for how long?
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the types of things that are
gonna revolutionize that so Just want to
[SPEAKER_05]: open it up to some quite first a round of
applause for our panelists very very
[SPEAKER_05]: insightful I see the question back over
there Got five minutes for questions Hey
[SPEAKER_03]: guys, thank you so much for sharing your
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could geek out with you guys for a while
Yeah, we could for sure CEO at abstracts
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin you did a great job mentioning
narrow broad scopes with John Hopkins and
[SPEAKER_03]: although this one's going wider I
appreciate them also having a narrow focus
[SPEAKER_03]: with that study really I believe you
mentioned some of our research possibly on
[SPEAKER_03]: with Western Washington on the studies
done with terpenes and autism and Alberta
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally agree with you that minor
cannabinoids need not only more research
[SPEAKER_03]: behaviorally, but also toxicology with
Abstracts we've invested significant
[SPEAKER_03]: resources into researching cannabis aroma
compounds putting out a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: publications on the science of exotic
Thiles esters flavorants everything that
[SPEAKER_03]: affects the cannabis experience And so
there's a lot of talk here about
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids and how they affect
experience But as really you mentioned our
[SPEAKER_03]: research with Western Washington these
play a bigger part in here I would argue
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these more smaller volatile
compounds were discovering have a broader
[SPEAKER_03]: impact in the experience And so what can
we do together?
[SPEAKER_03]: To help foster more research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a great reason We got a great
relationship with John Hopkins as a good
[SPEAKER_03]: example But they don't always include us
in everything that they're doing and so
[SPEAKER_03]: how do we start?
[SPEAKER_03]: chemotyping these in including more of the
aroma complexes the cannabis chemistry
[SPEAKER_03]: that is really defining the experience of
these products so that it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: subjectively tailored towards cannabinoids
alone and Secondarily if we have time love
[SPEAKER_03]: to just listen maybe what's your most
favorite research on the horizon that you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys are most excited about Thank you,
let's start with the one and I don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll see if there's no more questions And
we'll we'll hit that second question,
[SPEAKER_05]: but maybe with this first question go
ahead Justin It's great question the role
[SPEAKER_04]: of terpenes turpenoids as an example of
these aromatics is It's becoming better
[SPEAKER_04]: appreciated, but it's still not well
understood.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been alternative classification
systems for genotyping proposed on on
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene synthesis pathways Which is an
interesting sort of way to look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant I don't know that there is a I Don't
know that there's a like a silver bullet
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of approach to how do we generate
more?
[SPEAKER_04]: research on The role of terpenes,
but I think it has to be addressed from
[SPEAKER_04]: Initially, maybe a therapeutic
perspective, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in order to do that We also have to
have a better understanding of the
[SPEAKER_04]: turprone turpene profile and ratios of The
source material that's being used
[SPEAKER_04]: therapeutically, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a very limited sort of
understanding already Having to do with
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabinoid profile of what's being
used as a medical cannabis product in most
[SPEAKER_04]: cases people aren't really paying
attention to the ratios and and the
[SPEAKER_04]: contents at anything but a superficial
level so Making sure that that becomes
[SPEAKER_04]: part of the conversation That you have an
informed patient slash consumer and then
[SPEAKER_04]: that goes to the practitioner and I think
that maybe drives research Maybe it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: other way around but I think part of it is
just educating people about the role and
[SPEAKER_04]: You can look at them in abstracts,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can look at fractionated isolated
terpenes where they're derived from you
[SPEAKER_04]: can look at how they act isolation But
really what we're looking at is a
[SPEAKER_04]: synergistic hole in the relationship So I
would say you start with Making that more
[SPEAKER_04]: of a conversation at that entry level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah agreed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we have any more time I
think we're out of time We don't sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish we could sit here all day talk with
these panels with questions, but then guy
[SPEAKER_03]: was here I'm very strict.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it again for the whole panel
That was very informative You You You You
