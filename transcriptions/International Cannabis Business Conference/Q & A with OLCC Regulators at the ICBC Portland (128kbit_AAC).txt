[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Anthony and Mr. Steve Marks.
[SPEAKER_07]: First, I want to introduce the other folks
from OLCC that you've probably seen
[SPEAKER_07]: before.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the end, we have Jesse Sweet,
who is the director of the administrative
[SPEAKER_07]: policy and process for the state.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have Amanda Borup in the middle
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amanda is a marijuana program policy
analyst.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have Danica Hipsman,
who is the director of statewide
[SPEAKER_07]: licensing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's welcome them up to the stage,
please, real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've got some questions prepared where
we're going to put them on the spot and
[SPEAKER_07]: find out some of what I know is burning in
people's minds.
[SPEAKER_07]: First, I'll just give you a little
background.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see a lot of familiar faces,
people that have been in the industry for
[SPEAKER_07]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over 25 years ago, when I was discovering
cannabis, getting out of high school,
[SPEAKER_07]: and learning what I liked about it for
recreational purposes then, my mother came
[SPEAKER_07]: down with cancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my best friend's mother got HIV from a
blood transplant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the 90s, HIV was still very
mysterious.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we weren't understanding what was up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people were afraid to hug or kiss her.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I knew a little more about it and was
very involved with trying to help her feel
[SPEAKER_07]: better.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a very good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then both of our moms were going
through this traumatic period.
[SPEAKER_07]: We lost his mom.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my mom survived twice breast cancer
and has been around a long time still
[SPEAKER_07]: trucking along.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're both, one was pro cannabis and
one wasn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my mom had never smoked cannabis and
never been around cannabis and did not
[SPEAKER_07]: want me to be around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was hard for me to come at her and
explain how beneficial this could be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mom, I see this as helping people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had some good friends that took me down
to San Francisco on a trip and introduced
[SPEAKER_07]: me to some crazy wild guys that were
talking about hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some of you might know who Jack Herr
is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard of Jack.
[SPEAKER_07]: God rest his soul.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's give Jack a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_07]: We miss Jack.
[SPEAKER_07]: And crazy Ed Rosenthal who taught me how
to grow cannabis when I didn't know how.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I could try and provide my mother with
a product that was going to help her get
[SPEAKER_07]: through her problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: For the last 25 years or so, I worked with
voter power, the organization,
[SPEAKER_07]: and Anthony Johnson was there with me in
the streets with clipboards, getting
[SPEAKER_07]: signatures to put a medical ballot on
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did that and eventually got the
original ELMA passed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And through voter power, I learned about
what medical clinics meant and what
[SPEAKER_07]: outreach meant to patients and what we had
to do to help these people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wasn't just my mom, it was
everybody's mom and grandma and uncles and
[SPEAKER_07]: brothers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we worked hard to try and get
focused on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: They really taught me how to organize and
rally around these people to get them what
[SPEAKER_07]: they needed on the product line and to
teach growers how to provide for patients
[SPEAKER_07]: and provide for their family members,
which is the key to this whole system
[SPEAKER_07]: working.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we started doing clinics.
[SPEAKER_07]: I eventually left voter power,
started Southern Oregon Alternative
[SPEAKER_07]: Medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in about 16 cities in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I started Arizona Alternative Health.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had an uncle down there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went down and wanted to do the same
thing for people there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very tough state in the beginning,
I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was tough.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I remember getting spat on and
people wanted a fist fight because we were
[SPEAKER_07]: getting signatures to put cannabis on the
ballot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Southern Oregon was not the most
friendly area, even though that's where
[SPEAKER_07]: some of the best cannabis in the world was
grown in the woods.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd often wait for hours to go up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the time I'd go get an ounce in the
woods, by the time I got home,
[SPEAKER_07]: it would take a whole day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the two people that would introduce me
to the next people to get it and never met
[SPEAKER_07]: the guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, all of you remember these
early stories of how we got our cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: and fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I blew glass for a long time and was
just wanted to do anything close to the
[SPEAKER_07]: industry, but helping people and seeing
the satisfaction and watching people's
[SPEAKER_07]: lives be better that are suffering through
traumatic illnesses and traumatic times in
[SPEAKER_07]: their lives, losing family members and
getting through that was the biggest part
[SPEAKER_07]: of my life and been the joy of my life to
work with patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: A few years ago, a friend of mine in
Southern Oregon, I have a restaurant down
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: A friend of mine came in that had just
been appointed into the OLCC as chairman,
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob Patrick, who's not with the agency
anymore, but was elected by former
[SPEAKER_07]: Governor Kitzhaber to handle that stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he came to me and said, hey,
he was a former prosecutor.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was a Klamath DA.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all he knew about cannabis was going
into a farm, cutting the plants down and
[SPEAKER_07]: arresting everybody on site.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was a little bit different angle for
him to come and told me, hey, I don't know
[SPEAKER_07]: anything about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Will you help me do this?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's when we started forming the
Rules Advisory Committee and getting a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of great people in the industry that have
been around a long time that understand
[SPEAKER_07]: how it goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one thing I can say about the agency
is they've done absolutely their best and
[SPEAKER_07]: with limited resources and limited funding
to not only pay attention to this massive
[SPEAKER_07]: undertaking of creating a regulated market
around cannabis, which is what a long,
[SPEAKER_07]: strange trip it's been.
[SPEAKER_07]: I often repeat to myself, it's just a trip
to see where we're at.
[SPEAKER_07]: To see an organized convention like this,
organized business people getting involved
[SPEAKER_07]: and taking it to the next level is super
exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of challenges.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the agency is doing a good job
with what they have to hear us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they did a statewide listening tour in
the beginning and went around and really
[SPEAKER_07]: wanted to hear what we thought it should
look like.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some things turned out the way we
thought they should be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some things didn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we're learning as industry
people, some of these things are for the
[SPEAKER_07]: best.
[SPEAKER_07]: The tracking system, things that we never
did when we were growing for years,
[SPEAKER_07]: keeping track of what nutrients we were
using or what was potentially a better
[SPEAKER_07]: strain than another.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was all just not organized.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're organizing these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're able to operate in the open,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the black market was the way it
was.
[SPEAKER_07]: The black market was how people made
money.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how we had to make money to be able
to make medicine for people.
[SPEAKER_07]: The day Pfizer starts making pills for
free, then I would say growers should be
[SPEAKER_07]: able to grow for free.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this new introduction into where
medical patients and medical growers are
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be able to participate in the
recreational system.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to talk about that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Steve talked about it a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a complicated thing to make people
understand something we've been doing in
[SPEAKER_07]: the program for over around 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of a sudden now it's a big shift.
[SPEAKER_07]: And patients and growers that are in that
realm don't deal with the changes as easy
[SPEAKER_07]: as others.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're trying to find some balance in
between.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think Oregon by far, and people have
heard me say this before, but I think we
[SPEAKER_07]: are the number one state in the country
that has legalized cannabis and protected
[SPEAKER_07]: our medical patients and growers far
beyond anyone else's programs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a big deal to know that these people
sitting here, even they don't have to,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're not dictated necessarily to care.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're dictated to do something about
what the legislature says to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know these people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know them personally.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they care.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know they do want to find a way for us
to be able to take care of our patients
[SPEAKER_07]: and keep them in the mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob Patrick understood that, how important
it was to take care of the people who this
[SPEAKER_07]: industry was built on.
[SPEAKER_07]: This industry was built around sick and
disabled people and the growers and
[SPEAKER_07]: caregivers that were compassionate enough
to take it on and risk imprisonment a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of times.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think where we're at now from where
we've been is light years.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have a long way to go with
great legislators.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some of them here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sitting with us that are keeping our
voices heard at the legislative level,
[SPEAKER_07]: which gives them the tools they need at
the administrative level to make these
[SPEAKER_07]: things happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the frustrating things we've seen
as a multiple license holder, I've got
[SPEAKER_07]: stores.
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand the challenges of stores.
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand where farmers are.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got to pay our crew at the end of
the harvest season.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know the challenges around stores being
too many stores.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of us feel like there's too many.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so those are the kind of things that
we have to be vocal about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I encourage you to be vocal with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I encourage you to be vocal with your
legislators and the legislators you know
[SPEAKER_07]: that are in the realm of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Senator Prozanski is sitting with us
today, been one of our great champions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's give him a round of applause really
quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Floyd has been awesome and really hearing
what the challenges are and staying with
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of legislators have kind of come and
gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've lost our committee that was a group
of legislators deemed to kind of handle
[SPEAKER_07]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we're back in the open waters
again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has to be included in something
that they want to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have obviously constituents that
want many things handled.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know land usage things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis is not the top thing for every
legislator.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the fact that people like Senator
Prozanski still find time and realize how
[SPEAKER_07]: important it is that we shape this
industry the right way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that happens through what he does at
his job.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it lets them do their job.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know we can get that middle
ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see I know businesses are struggling.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really challenging time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're held to one standard.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean you have an open market concept in
a single state for sales.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean once federal change happens is
really what we're all kind of hovering and
[SPEAKER_07]: waiting for.
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately a lot of the smaller
outfits which is who we want to support.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want those small family farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do think there's a future.
[SPEAKER_07]: People ask me all the time I'm a small
business.
[SPEAKER_07]: How am I going to compete with those big
dollars coming in from Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I think we're in a microbrew
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know we really are.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a it's the new era of where that mom
and pop product that organic farm those
[SPEAKER_07]: things are important and those are what
consumers are looking for.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you have a small business you have a
small farm brand yourself well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always say it's really important to
stand out on the store shelves.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you're going to get your
product out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a lot of people growing flour but
flour is selling.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is selling.
[SPEAKER_07]: And once we get more licenses on and
they're working you know vigilantly to get
[SPEAKER_07]: that done the new processors that come
online the new product lines that come out
[SPEAKER_07]: you see how many products are in the store
now go into a 711 or go into a liquor
[SPEAKER_07]: store or whatever reference you want to
use.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of room for product
development and that's really where that
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis is going to be eaten up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as we create new oil lines and new
product lines and all these great ideas
[SPEAKER_07]: that people are coming up with we're going
to see that reduction happen even in
[SPEAKER_07]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're going to see cannabis
starting to be eaten up more and it'll
[SPEAKER_07]: drive the prices back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once we go federal legal obviously that's
the launch point.
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now you're preparing yourself for
what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're preparing yourself to be relevant
on a national marketplace and that should
[SPEAKER_07]: really be your focus right now is doing
your product doing it well and knowing how
[SPEAKER_07]: to scale when the time comes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I assume when the time comes and we can't
ship out of state we'll look back at the
[SPEAKER_07]: rules and regs around how big a farm can
be and we'll go from an acre to
[SPEAKER_07]: potentially 20 acres or whatever it takes
as we see that product able to move.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now we keep that acre that's not
going to be like that forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eventually you will be able to grow you
know massive fields of cannabis as the
[SPEAKER_07]: demand will be there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But right now we're just kind of held to
this state and it's like a hovering game.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just need to hang out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to see I really discourages
me to see people giving up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's financially difficult not to
in some instances.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've dealt with all that myself but we got
to hang in there because those ideas that
[SPEAKER_07]: you have and those products are the
future.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the end of prohibition all over
again.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at those signs and what's
happening you'll see this is how it went.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not everybody made it but a lot of people
did make it and it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to be a big corporate
shift.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the small family farm and the
small product manufacturer definitely has
[SPEAKER_07]: a place.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking forward to see how that
kind of turns out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So stay in there hang in there and then
let's give these guys a little bit of heat
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a couple of questions that I got.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Danica I'm going to put this one to
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I've been hearing quite a few
violations could have been avoided by
[SPEAKER_07]: licensees reporting changes to all CC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you let us know what the common
violations are and what licenses need to
[SPEAKER_07]: let all CC know?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try Amanda's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that better?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's better.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no secret that this market is in
an incredibly dynamic but difficult phase
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took a very free market approach in
Oregon here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So over the last couple of years a lot of
licensees coming on board and I think it
[SPEAKER_02]: was not unexpected that at some point
there would be somewhat of a glut in the
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many licensees too much product prices
go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Businesses are struggling.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people that are trying to
bring on new investors, selling out their
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses, a lot of consolidation going
on or trying to scale up or scale down
[SPEAKER_02]: their operations within the premises that
they've licensed.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that are things that require
licensing attention and it's one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons why we shifted a lot of our focus
from new applications to be able to serve
[SPEAKER_02]: those existing licensees and help them get
through this phase of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is where we're seeing a lot of
businesses that are not following the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations and it is concerning because
in order to keep this market continue to
[SPEAKER_02]: let it evolve and grow we need to be able
to make sure that we are vetting the
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are coming into it,
that we know the premises that are being
[SPEAKER_02]: licensed, and we know what's happening on
those licensed premises.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of those things, making changes to
a premises, making changes to your
[SPEAKER_02]: business structure, selling your business,
all of that requires OLCC pre-approval and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what we're really not seeing a lot
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing a lot of people come in after
the fact and frankly a lot of those things
[SPEAKER_02]: can actually be cancelable offenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are a licensee or you know a
licensee, please help us get the word out
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're there to help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a process under which you can let
us know that you're making those changes
[SPEAKER_02]: and we want to get them done for you as
quickly as possible but it is something
[SPEAKER_02]: that you need to contact us first,
work through that process and do it the
[SPEAKER_02]: right way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I think you know and I talk
about a little bit about licensees or I
[SPEAKER_07]: think it is important to let the agency
know when these changes happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's super important to let them know
ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's still some fear of people
maybe making changes that they're not
[SPEAKER_07]: ready for and I want to get the message
out that people need to call the agency
[SPEAKER_07]: and let them know.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're having a problem you need to let
them know.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to know about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're having one topic I've been
talking to them about is camera issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had a lot of companies have kind of
disappeared and left a lot of growers and
[SPEAKER_07]: other licenses in the lurch.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think is the best method for
people to communicate with the agency
[SPEAKER_07]: because ultimately that's what we want.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want people to call talk to you guys
about the problems they're having and know
[SPEAKER_07]: that they're not going to be put on the
chopping block when it comes to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely I mean just just contact us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean we have a dedicated email marijuana
at Oregon dot gov that you can send any
[SPEAKER_02]: question to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will get to the right person.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have staff that read every single one
of those emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a call in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember the number right now,
but we can get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a booth here, so please stop by
and get any information that you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really want people to call and ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no too small of a question out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can usually help you work through
whatever process, whatever issue you've
[SPEAKER_02]: got, if you just contact us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's important for people to
know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Danica.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important that people know
that the agency is ready to work with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want us to be successful.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are not here to prevent us from being
successful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see a lot of fear with clients I work
with and people in the industry that you
[SPEAKER_07]: cannot, at this point, see the agency as
the enemy in your process.
[SPEAKER_07]: They understand that there's fears around
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I encourage people to reach out to the
agency when you're having problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them know what you're having.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure that you're keeping good records
of everything that's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll find a way around that,
and they'll help you find a way around
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to make your life easier,
and you're going to sleep better.
[SPEAKER_07]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse, I've got one for you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Has OLCC been able to make it to most of
the outdoor producers who are harvesting
[SPEAKER_07]: in this new operation, Good Harvest?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you finding common violations when
those people are going out to those type
[SPEAKER_07]: of sites?
[SPEAKER_07]: Does OLCC plan to do similar Good Harvest
stuff with the indoor growers and not just
[SPEAKER_07]: the outdoor producers?
[SPEAKER_04]: As Steve touched on, we're out there doing
harvest notice inspections.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have done approximately 60 of these
inspections so far, and I think we're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at about a 70% successful
compliance rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're seeing when we're out there is
not necessarily problems with the harvest
[SPEAKER_04]: or the harvest notification process
itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's more common is we're seeing
operational problems, things like the
[SPEAKER_04]: fences collapsing isn't in place,
or growers are drying in a facility that's
[SPEAKER_04]: not approved and doesn't have cameras.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things that we would have caught in any
kind of routine inspection, and the
[SPEAKER_04]: harvest notification process has,
I think, been a really good tool for our
[SPEAKER_04]: staff to get organized and get mobilized
out to those growers who they,
[SPEAKER_04]: in many cases, haven't visited for quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're seeing mostly falls along the
lines of people who just aren't paying
[SPEAKER_04]: enough attention to compliance and the
operational standards that we have in our
[SPEAKER_04]: rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a really, really tough industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tough for a lot of reasons that you
all know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Banking, taxes, competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also tough because we have put forth
a lot of regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that, and we're working with the
industry to get people compliant,
[SPEAKER_04]: to get them to where they need to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: In some cases, when we can't get people
there, we have to pursue license
[SPEAKER_04]: cancellation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll reiterate what Brent said.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the saying, ask for forgiveness,
not permission.
[SPEAKER_04]: That does not work in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It simply doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to ask for permission.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as indoor growers, we're focusing
on the outdoor growers right now because
[SPEAKER_04]: we are in harvest, and we've got a large
amount of product coming down in a very
[SPEAKER_04]: short window.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to use the rest of the year
following this harvest season to start
[SPEAKER_04]: getting out and making more contact with
the indoor growers so that we can do the
[SPEAKER_04]: same types of premises inspections to
ensure that they're operating in
[SPEAKER_04]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of work with the limited staff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen them do some pretty amazing
things with not very many people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse, we were talking a little bit ago,
and describes himself as the designated
[SPEAKER_07]: driver at the end of the night.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only sober one in the vehicle.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a really hard task.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of these things I throw at
him constantly.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to figure out how to make
what we've done forever work with what
[SPEAKER_07]: they understand they need to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't always make sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't always understand how that looks.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're trying to understand,
and they're trying to find a way in the
[SPEAKER_07]: regulatory process to allow us to do our
job.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we looked at, some of you may have
saw the big pile of burning marijuana that
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a couple years ago kind of went
national.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bob and Tom called me about it,
but it was all about moldy cannabis and
[SPEAKER_07]: what that looked like.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the beginning, a lot of these rules and
regulations came from what they knew
[SPEAKER_07]: metric came from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: They only understood indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_07]: They wanted us to cut a whole plant,
and hang it upside down when we harvest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once I showed them what plants look like,
they understood why that probably wasn't
[SPEAKER_07]: going to work.
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 pound outdoor plants don't do that,
not without a small crane.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they came down, they came to the
farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did tours of many farms, and saw what
that looks like, and why there is moldy
[SPEAKER_07]: material, and why we do have waste on a
farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a farm like any other farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have lots of biomass that we end up
burning, getting rid of, that goes on the
[SPEAKER_07]: ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a valuable product that we're
trying to sell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Send out to the masses through the black
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's waste.
[SPEAKER_07]: They understood that, and the rules now
reflect that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how the whole process has been.
[SPEAKER_07]: Going through, showing them what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to see what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why this communication is so
important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Giving them ideas of what your challenges
are helps them find a way around it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I try and stay so active,
and letting them know any information I
[SPEAKER_07]: can that's going to help them do their job
better, which makes our lives much easier
[SPEAKER_07]: when things are running smooth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse, I'm going to throw one more at you,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like the OSDC has been holding
quite a few rules advisory committee
[SPEAKER_07]: meetings, as we did on the sales limits
recently.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are the main topics you're focused
on, and when should we expect some kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: finalization in the rule process?
[SPEAKER_04]: To answer this, I'll start at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: In late 2015, the agency adopted close to
100 pages of administrative rules before
[SPEAKER_04]: we'd issued a single license.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, that first rule package was not
perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have undergone, since that time,
major revisions in the legislature.
[SPEAKER_04]: The agency and its rulemaking has devoted
most of its resources to keeping up with
[SPEAKER_04]: the legislative changes rather than going
back and fine-tuning that base package
[SPEAKER_04]: based on what we have learned from both
our staff working in the field and from
[SPEAKER_04]: input people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a very broad package
of rules coming through this fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will likely be adopted by our
commission in December.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lay commission, and they are the
final policy makers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Staff like me draft things and suggest
things to them, but they ultimately guide
[SPEAKER_04]: the policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those rules will focus, as I said,
on a number of refinements.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the major subject matter areas are
volatile processing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to make some refinements to our
approval process to make sure that those
[SPEAKER_04]: processors that are using volatile
solvents are doing so in the safest manner
[SPEAKER_04]: possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at reforming our waste
rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, I think, a good bit that we can
do there to make sure, not only that the
[SPEAKER_04]: waste rules really make sense for growers
and processors, but also that they make
[SPEAKER_04]: sense in terms of mitigating opportunities
for diversion.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have identified waste as one of the key
areas where items can be misrepresented in
[SPEAKER_04]: metric and diversion can occur.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll also be looking at refining a number
of things around our compliance areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: What licensees can and can't do when
they're under suspension, for example?
[SPEAKER_04]: Under what conditions would we restrict a
license rather than cancel it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fairly long list.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as the calendar goes, we will be
putting out a public notice which will say
[SPEAKER_04]: in much more detail what we're
considering.
[SPEAKER_04]: That public notice will go out in
November, I believe, which begins a
[SPEAKER_04]: two-week public comment period.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really important that people who have
an interest in these rules pay attention
[SPEAKER_04]: to that public comment period.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can sign up for automatic email
updates on our website, and they will tell
[SPEAKER_04]: you exactly when that public comment
period is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But too often, we go through this
rule-making process that's required by the
[SPEAKER_04]: law to be an inclusive public process.
[SPEAKER_04]: We finish our rules, we adopt them,
and then three or four weeks later,
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear from somebody in the industry that
says, this rule that you just did is
[SPEAKER_04]: nonsense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really difficult for the agency to
receive the input and make a meaningful
[SPEAKER_04]: change at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: The time for meaningful input is in the
public comment period.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when it's going to be very useful
for us to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would encourage everyone who's not
signed up for those updates, sign up for
[SPEAKER_04]: the updates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Read the rules carefully when we put out
our notice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Devote the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have an interest, devote the time
before the rules are final.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way that you'll be the most
effective advocate for your interest.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't vote, you don't get to bitch.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to get our voices out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to let them know what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_07]: These public comment periods are so
important to show up to and make your
[SPEAKER_07]: voice be heard, because there's things
that not everybody thinks of.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think of everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's so many challenges that
we're facing in the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really important that we communicate
that to the agency so they can try and fix
[SPEAKER_07]: it and make it work better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please be active.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please be involved in that process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amanda, I'm going to shoot one back at you
on medical stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of question around medical.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of fear about transitioning
in, getting people tracked, getting people
[SPEAKER_07]: in the system.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's still a lot of questions
about how a cardholder can access medicine
[SPEAKER_07]: in the new system and what that looks
like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give us a quick rundown on options that
people have coming into that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I want to start at the retail
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the retail level, a cardholder can
receive product free of charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also not taxed on the product that
they purchased at the retail level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they can buy what are called medical
grade products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are products made at a higher
concentration limit or a higher potency
[SPEAKER_01]: limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the recreational users.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what we hear a lot is people who
used to be growers, who now are
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational producers, and they want to
be able to give their patients medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: or people who used to be their patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a really simple way for people to
do that would be able to work with a
[SPEAKER_01]: retailer in their community, transfer the
product to the retailer, and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: retailer would give the cardholders that
product for free or at a very low cost if
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what they decided to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really important to highlight
that that connection can still happen
[SPEAKER_01]: without the typical grower-patient
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then also, or did you want to cut in?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just want to interject.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, and this involves retailer.
[SPEAKER_07]: We talk about retailers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Retailers, we have a lot on us.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of the things that we need to
decide to participate in.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a retailer and there's people
going around, there's several groups
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to get some good programs started
for patient access, some free patient
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've talked to farmers that are willing
to donate.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need retailers involved in that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where the point of access is for
those patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a retailer, you need to make it
available.
[SPEAKER_07]: When someone comes to you and says,
hey, we're working on a patient access
[SPEAKER_07]: program.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd like to list your store as one of the
stores patients can come to, to get free
[SPEAKER_07]: meds.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of people in this state that
can't afford to buy meds.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're living on a monthly check.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have the money to buy meds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care how cheap it gets in the
store.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not in your budget when your top
priorities are food, and medicine,
[SPEAKER_07]: and keeping your heat on.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to get active.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to be involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to stop shy.
[SPEAKER_07]: All I hear from the people that are
starting these programs, Steve Mark's been
[SPEAKER_07]: adamantly working on trying to find a way
to find that compassionate venue.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to happen at the retail level.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's where it has to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Retailers, if you're here, we need to be
involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to be involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to make sure that we're giving
that vessel for these people to be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: get their medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't take a little bit more storage
space to have just a basic product that is
[SPEAKER_07]: your giveaway for that month or something
that you can donate to a cardholder.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to take care of these people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have our own struggles, but we can't
forget who these people are and why we've
[SPEAKER_07]: been doing this for so long and how
important that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where it's got to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where they have to be able to keep
track of what's happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can give away free medicine at the
stores.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have to be taxed for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to take advantage of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great loophole.
[SPEAKER_07]: I call it a loophole, but it's a great
venue and a way to get medicine out to
[SPEAKER_07]: people.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where it's at.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to get it out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're finding a way to do it,
but we need to step up as industry people
[SPEAKER_07]: and donate those products from your farms,
donate those products from your cookie
[SPEAKER_07]: companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever you're making, you can be
involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that we need to continue
throughout this process, is taking care of
[SPEAKER_07]: our sickest and most needy folks in this
state.
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a couple other ways,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So legislation passed recently allows for
an OLCC licensed processor to apply for an
[SPEAKER_01]: endorsement with OLCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something that you would need to
fill out a form to get an endorsement for
[SPEAKER_01]: and be approved before you were able to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would allow a processor to take in
flour material from a patient directly and
[SPEAKER_01]: process that and then give it back to the
patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are limits to that, but that is an
option.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we don't want people to be doing is
processing in their garages or doing
[SPEAKER_01]: things in unsafe ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what this does is it allows a
licensed processor to be able to run that
[SPEAKER_01]: material and turn it into a product
directly for a patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, producers, OLCC licensed
producers can apply for an endorsement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be the same thing,
filling out a form and getting approval.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can grow an additional area of
plants for patients only.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's called a medically designated
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, on all levels of the licensed
system, there is a way for patients to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to receive product and be able to
have an affordable medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that says it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to start getting a little more
involved on that and remember these
[SPEAKER_07]: people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we're busy, but we need to remember
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I want to do now is give an
opportunity for you to ask some questions
[SPEAKER_07]: of the folks we have up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: There will be some time after to
one-on-one things.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we have some questions in the
crowd, I think we're starting to get back
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it for the panel one more time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, by the way, on the questions,
please be brief and no rambling.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all we ask.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is for Jesse Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just like to know,
well, this is a two-part question.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, how many registrations you have
received for the 20-pound transfer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, when that's going to go
into effect?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm getting hand signals from the
audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe the answer is 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll finish it off just because we
recently had a meeting on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jesse wasn't able to join us because
he had another meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have about between 10 and 15
applications in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're doing right now is we're
working with the cannabis tracking system
[SPEAKER_01]: with metric to be able to make it so that
transfer will be allowable in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons it's taking a little
bit of time is that due to grower
[SPEAKER_01]: confidentiality, we have to make sure that
we don't loosen the blocks between
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational and medical too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really want to keep that on the
forefront.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're working on getting that done
as soon as possible, but with your guys'
[SPEAKER_01]: safety in mind as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a company, a seed to sale company.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have four different licenses.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've been doing this for a few years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I find the renewal process to be
really bureaucratic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm wondering if you guys are working
on streamlining part of the renewal
[SPEAKER_09]: process if you haven't had any changes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, one of the questions about have
you ever had an exception?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, yes, three years ago we had
one.
[SPEAKER_09]: So just, you know, if you haven't had any
changes, are we working on streamlining
[SPEAKER_09]: that not only to limit your bureaucracy,
but ours as well?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's a lot of work for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the short answer is yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's definitely been difficult on
our end as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the biggest reasons why it has been
a more cumbersome process for licensees is
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the volume of changes that have
happened both legislatively and with our
[SPEAKER_02]: rules over the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody licensed really early on by
the time they get to their renewal.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a number of changes in the
requirements that we just need to verify
[SPEAKER_02]: that they meet those current standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a lot of change going on in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're seeing that at the renewal time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the time that people are changing
their tiers or adding business partners or
[SPEAKER_02]: looking to sell their business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has been cumbersome, both for
licensees and on our end as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we finally have gotten to a space,
though, where we have a pretty streamlined
[SPEAKER_02]: packet, pretty stripped down requirements,
just making sure that there are no
[SPEAKER_02]: changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're looking to get to a place where
we could almost have an automatic type of
[SPEAKER_02]: renewal so that if there hasn't been no
changes, it can be just instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is yet another area that one of the
reasons why we have shifted our licensing
[SPEAKER_02]: staff over to focusing more on those
renewals is because we know a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses want to make those changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we need to get them processed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the longer version of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, we are working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're actually getting into a
good space so that hopefully people that
[SPEAKER_02]: have gone through that very cumbersome
process in the last year, the next time
[SPEAKER_02]: they renew, it's going to be much,
much faster and easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I'd like to thank all of you
for your hard work and dedication.
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is along the same lines as the
previous question, referencing Director
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark's August 30th memo that stated that
there are two investigators assigned to
[SPEAKER_05]: work on new applications.
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is, are there any additional
personnel or resources being applied or
[SPEAKER_05]: hopefully in the near future to be applied
to processing new applications to reduce
[SPEAKER_05]: the now 12 to 14 or longer month waiting
period for new application processing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate that question.
[SPEAKER_06]: We asked for extra resources to help out
Danica's licensing team during the
[SPEAKER_06]: session.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got some during the emergency board
time to help move forward with the
[SPEAKER_06]: applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are not going to get any more relief
from staffing in the near term.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our budget is set.
[SPEAKER_06]: We only have a finite number of folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as Danica explained, we're really
looking at getting those renewals moving
[SPEAKER_06]: forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to continue to be slow for
licensees.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the reasons that we
communicated out there because we know
[SPEAKER_06]: people have a ton of investment moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want you to have realistic
expectations about what we can do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what's going to happen in the
legislative session next year when they
[SPEAKER_06]: look at us for our next two year budget
and what we're going to need and how they
[SPEAKER_06]: see our system.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you know, we've got a lot of supply in.
[SPEAKER_06]: The HIDA report's been out.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's discussions about ways to moderate
the overall system.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll probably, we're going to be doing a
supply study on that and looking at that
[SPEAKER_06]: as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to make direct
recommendations to the legislature.
[SPEAKER_06]: We may provide them with ideas about how
to manage a large supply and the licensee
[SPEAKER_06]: issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know what resources are really
going to look like in the future either.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's just we've got to be real
with people about where we sit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think you can have the
expectation that suddenly we're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: bust loose and have a lot more folks doing
licensing in the near term.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike with Rely Grow Systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: The federal government has a long history
of farm subsidies.
[SPEAKER_03]: After last season's incredible market
correction, a lot of very knowledgeable
[SPEAKER_03]: talent, grower families suffered all kinds
of losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any opportunity on a state level,
OLCC level, that's really experienced
[SPEAKER_03]: several years of incredible tax revenues
of diverting some of that back to farmers
[SPEAKER_03]: or back to people in the industry to
support this nascent Oregon industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll take that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where they want to apply it,
but we've already seen, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the legislature put some of those dollars
to work in the enforcement side,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They provided enforcement dollars to the
criminal justice commission.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's discussion about how do
you maybe subsidize some number of
[SPEAKER_06]: patients in the medical system that are
indigent with some of those dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is requests I hear about having like
a farm subsidy program.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that that's going to fly,
but I do know it's an active conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you are generating a lot of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sales in the last couple months have been
continuing to go up in terms of tax
[SPEAKER_06]: receipts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know how much of that you can
get, but I certainly do think that there's
[SPEAKER_06]: a strong interest in general research,
medical research in general, research
[SPEAKER_06]: around the cannabis side.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also this interest in how do we
support a broader nursery system,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we're going to need that I think
eventually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's happening out there,
but we haven't seen that nursery
[SPEAKER_06]: endorsement really taking place where you
could have maybe more strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because now you have to realize your
new production inside the system,
[SPEAKER_06]: we really do need to make sure that those
plants are available and grown so people
[SPEAKER_06]: can plant their crops in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the answer is there's some money there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some of it will be directed
towards the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I can't tell you where.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about the dollars.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can say we've watched a lot of them
having to use liquor staff on the cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: side, and we really need to push and talk
to your legislators about making sure that
[SPEAKER_07]: the allotment goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: They need more money.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't always say it, but I see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They need more money to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want faster turnaround times.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes staff.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're limited people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a limited, you know,
this guy's deemed with taking care of all
[SPEAKER_07]: the packaging and labeling.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a big undertaking when you've got
so many product lines coming in.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they need more money, but they're held
to what they have budget-wise.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've done an amazing job with what
I've seen them do just to give you a
[SPEAKER_07]: little insight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just jump right back in here
because I do want to talk about one of our
[SPEAKER_06]: main priorities, one of our efficiency
points.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, our licensing system worked well
for us to get you up and running.
[SPEAKER_06]: We produced over $200 million of tax
revenue with that initial system we put
[SPEAKER_06]: in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that hasn't worked well for us for
doing these renewals.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's failing us.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's failing Danica's team.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't see that, but this has really
put a lot of pressure on licensing because
[SPEAKER_06]: we don't have that automation in place.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to migrate out of the system
we are in.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't do anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: They helped us get to where we are.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just need a new product, a new
provider, and we need to work on the
[SPEAKER_06]: policies that help that move quicker so
that, you know, we'll have some
[SPEAKER_06]: efficiencies there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So on behalf of the agency, we need some
help with getting our IT requests in place
[SPEAKER_06]: and building that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That will help you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a quick question on a little
different side than product.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more on the service side.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any plans to create a
certification program similar to
[SPEAKER_10]: Washington as in the medical certification
program to recognize consultants'
[SPEAKER_10]: knowledge beyond bartenders, that kind of
thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I think the question refers to is
the program in Washington where they have
[SPEAKER_04]: certified consultants who are actually
present in the retail.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as I know, there's nobody
considering this type of thing in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I serve on the Oregon Cannabis Commission,
and there are a couple other members of
[SPEAKER_04]: that commission present in the audience
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: That commission has been considering ideas
around provider training, around employee
[SPEAKER_04]: training, which I think would be designed
to achieve the same type of goal that the
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington program is shooting for,
but doing it in a slightly different way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are just proposals right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Cannabis Commission needs to finalize
its recommendations, and those will be
[SPEAKER_04]: coming out later in the year.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thank you, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it again for the panelists.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, that's all the time we have
for questions.
