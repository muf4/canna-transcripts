knowledge But also I encourage everyone to
[SPEAKER_04]: try and connect with some of the panelists
after and especially at the party this
[SPEAKER_04]: evening So exciting Okay, so one of the
things I really wanted to chat with each
[SPEAKER_04]: of you about is to talk a little bit
personally about how You got into the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry and sort of what your your
inspirations are so feel free to take a
[SPEAKER_04]: few moments Jamie and and tell us tell us
a story I Got into the industry about five
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago Which is which is interesting
because my father was a clandestine grower
[SPEAKER_03]: my whole life so technically I was in the
industry whether I liked it or not because
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to know when to bring my friends
home You when it smelled like skunk in the
[SPEAKER_03]: garage and when I couldn't and I found
that annoying growing up Was a college
[SPEAKER_03]: athlete did not smoke marijuana was anti
marijuana and then I'm also the cousin of
[SPEAKER_03]: the DJ in Cypress Hill who lit a joint on
Saturday Night Live when I was in college
[SPEAKER_03]: and So had the poster child of marijuana
That I grew up with About five years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got sick I smoked marijuana at the
behest of my nephew it it fixed me
[SPEAKER_03]: instantly and From that day forward I was
no longer anti marijuana and mugs and I
[SPEAKER_03]: were investing in real estate together for
about 15 years and he had me review one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the first contracts that they were asked
to look at and coming into the marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: space and then I told him I wouldn't sign
it and I told him why I won't mention who
[SPEAKER_03]: the company was that was trying to get
Cypress to be their spokesperson and One
[SPEAKER_03]: thing led to another and he asked me to
represent the band and I started off in
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry as the marijuana manager or
agent for Cypress Hill and Through that
[SPEAKER_03]: partnership.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found bang and one thing led to another
and now I'm the COO Everything's possible
[SPEAKER_02]: Great thank you for sharing that Shanita I
Love cannabis and so throughout my
[SPEAKER_02]: corporate career actually a little bit
earlier than that Throughout my college
[SPEAKER_02]: and then corporate career.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was always just a closet consumer I grew
up in corporate supply chain and
[SPEAKER_02]: Transitioned my IT consulting business to
serve the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lending my background in project
management international marketing and
[SPEAKER_02]: Operations management to the industry was
my goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to see this industry look like
every other industry that I worked in from
[SPEAKER_02]: a professional and standards point of view
and so I saw the opportunity about five
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago when Maryland legalized medical
marijuana and Have been on a journey from
[SPEAKER_02]: Maryland to Pennsylvania and now out to
Oakland since Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Kevin So on a personal note,
I've been involved in the industry for 25
[SPEAKER_00]: years professionally in the last four it
kind of started when San Jose consolidated
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry And only allowed for 16
operators One of those operators happened
[SPEAKER_00]: to be really good friends with the
managing partner of our firm And so we
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of by dumb luck fell into that
working with that client and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful because I had such passion for
the industry to get that experience To
[SPEAKER_00]: learn with them and to kind of tackle it
from a professional perspective In doing
[SPEAKER_00]: so we saw that there was an incredible
need to help these businesses really
[SPEAKER_00]: flourish They don't really have the
infrastructure dialed in at first and so
[SPEAKER_00]: we really kind of spun off our Business
akin to kind of address a lot of the needs
[SPEAKER_00]: that we saw within that industry in terms
of navigating compliance documenting
[SPEAKER_00]: internal controls policies and procedures
Helping them develop all that framework to
[SPEAKER_00]: capture accurate information to make
decisions to help get financing So it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just been incredible how this Just kind of
came about to us and just really helped us
[SPEAKER_00]: build the expertise and really get
involved into this industry Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you And so I think many of us have a
personal connection and personal story
[SPEAKER_04]: about why we work in this industry,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: How many of you have have something that
touches you personally about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people do you think that work in
say real estate or the alcohol industry
[SPEAKER_04]: are super expired by by that industry I
think that that's part of the uniqueness
[SPEAKER_04]: of folks who work in the in the cannabis
space and something that Hopefully we're
[SPEAKER_04]: utilizing as a strength in order to
inspire Our businesses inspire each other
[SPEAKER_04]: and build strong partnerships around that
So I I would love to hear some of your
[SPEAKER_04]: stories afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been working on policy reform in
the cannabis space for Probably how almost
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 years first as a as an advocate and
cultivator and then more formally in
[SPEAKER_04]: working On with a number of nonprofits.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I spent almost a decade with the
marijuana policy project which works on
[SPEAKER_04]: national Issues federal issues,
but as well as state medical adult and
[SPEAKER_04]: adult use legalization through ballot
initiatives and the legislature so that is
[SPEAKER_04]: that's my background and now I get the the
privilege to work with CCIA and and one of
[SPEAKER_04]: the things that I think is so
extraordinary about the opportunities that
[SPEAKER_04]: that I've had and and that I've I've
worked for Is the partnerships that we've
[SPEAKER_04]: been able to create so first with CCIA and
then also with the marijuana policy
[SPEAKER_04]: project because really nothing happens in
a vacuum So I'd really love us to we're
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna dig in a little bit You know first
I'd like folks to kind of talk a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit about the current business that you're
in and and really kind of dive deep in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of the the business model And then
to think a little bit about what some of
[SPEAKER_04]: those strategic partnerships are because
they can take many different forms so I
[SPEAKER_04]: want us to To really dig in because I
think we each have a unique perspective on
[SPEAKER_04]: that So she need a why don't why don't we
start with you this time?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my consulting practice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Strategic partnerships are critical to
achieving our clients goals if we're
[SPEAKER_02]: applying for a license It's necessary for
us to form partnerships with the community
[SPEAKER_02]: to gain their acceptance for us even
operating In that space we have to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with the state to of course submit an
application That is merit-based and
[SPEAKER_02]: competitive enough to to win a license and
so it's not something that I can do alone
[SPEAKER_02]: as a one-woman show and So strategic
partnerships are critical for that work in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of my entrepreneurial endeavors
strategic partnerships have allowed me to
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually own a piece of the businesses
that I'm working in as a consultant It's
[SPEAKER_02]: one thing to be paid for your services,
but then you walk away From you know
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's gonna grow up to
hopefully be you know really big and so
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been able to go from just consulting
for a fee to actually exchanging my
[SPEAKER_02]: talents and skills for equity and it's
something that I couldn't do because I
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't necessarily write a $500,000
check or you know say I'm going to fund
[SPEAKER_02]: this million dollar project But with the
help of good folks that bring you know
[SPEAKER_02]: other resources to the table Not only
financial, but also their background
[SPEAKER_02]: perspectives Experiences in other
industries and so I think that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I've leveraged to not only
grow my consulting business But then also
[SPEAKER_02]: the projects that I'm partnering on Yeah,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I I have a couple thoughts on that that
I'd like to circle back to in a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: But Jamie what what about you well bangs
made our company?
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on strategic partnerships we
exploded onto the scene in California in
[SPEAKER_03]: 2010 we've got a nine-year history of
award-winning cannabis edibles and CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: products we were bringing CBD packaged
goods into California since 2011 so When
[SPEAKER_03]: when our CEO Scott really saw the
opportunity to expand the brand Nationally
[SPEAKER_03]: there was a barrier to entry in most of
the legal states because it would take a
[SPEAKER_03]: million dollars to get a license You know
in let's say One state, but you do that
[SPEAKER_03]: times 50 Conceivably you can see that it's
impossible to spread your brand if you are
[SPEAKER_03]: in control So you had to find operators in
those states that had the wherewithal to
[SPEAKER_03]: get the license be good operators and Had
an interest in taking the brand into that
[SPEAKER_03]: state so finding a strategic partnership
just to expand the brand was one thing but
[SPEAKER_03]: where we're at now that we're so far down
that path as we What we say is we used to
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to take what you can get and now
you get to get what you want in our
[SPEAKER_03]: partnerships because the industries come
so far along Now we're partnered with
[SPEAKER_03]: people like in diva in in Canada,
which is a publicly traded company our
[SPEAKER_03]: Licensee in California is origin house
formerly canna royalty, which is a
[SPEAKER_03]: publicly traded company our licensee in
Florida is true leave They they manage
[SPEAKER_03]: about 75 or I should say have a
stranglehold of about 75 percent of that
[SPEAKER_03]: market Those are companies that came to us
and said we want to represent and partner
[SPEAKER_03]: with your brand So we were able to build a
brand footprint with our strategic
[SPEAKER_03]: partnerships that have allowed us to grow
our brand Across the nation and now we're
[SPEAKER_03]: now being distributed in Germany
Liechtenstein Austria Poland Canada And
[SPEAKER_03]: we're expanding into some other countries
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really Exciting and we're gonna go
public in about three weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could not have done that Had we tried
to control everything on our own bangs
[SPEAKER_00]: really a testament to strategic
partnerships So strategic partnerships to
[SPEAKER_00]: me I just really honor The business owners
and entrepreneurs that really built the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that we have today There's people
that have been in this space when it was
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you couldn't really Talk about
it and their operators and they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing the envelope And so I just have
tremendous gratitude for those individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're all here because of that the
associations as well They put money
[SPEAKER_00]: towards lobbying So again, we're all
sitting here today because of the efforts
[SPEAKER_00]: of those that built this industry and
those that are supporting and moving this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry forward on a personal note I was
diagnosed 18 months ago with MS and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: because of their efforts that I have
access To CBD and products which helped me
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with my chronic back pain that's
happened as a result of my diagnosis So
[SPEAKER_00]: just tremendous gratitude and I want to
thank you know the associations And those
[SPEAKER_00]: that have built this industry And now we
kind of I look at it like we have an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity To kind of pay it forward and
so that's what you know our business kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of spun off to kind of help businesses
thrive so compliance as Lindsey had
[SPEAKER_00]: brought Up is is is it's it's so From so
many different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of red tape in which
operators have to navigate So we kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: help them Follow have documented processes
in place in an effort to kind of address
[SPEAKER_00]: the compliance issues that they have to
help them with financial policies and
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures to ensure that they're
capturing accurate information so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: make business decisions to grow so the
partnerships are Incredible and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: many partnerships we get through being
part of these events One thing I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: be for my client is as a consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know everything so I have to
leverage the other Service providers and
[SPEAKER_00]: professionals that I meet at events like
this So it really takes a village to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of help our clients really grow their
business And so I kind of love meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone within the different aspects of
servicing this industry so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of You know if a client says they
have a certain need I can find a person to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of help fill that need for them Yeah,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to think a little bit about
strategic partnerships in terms of what
[SPEAKER_04]: she needed was mentioning earlier either
investing or equity shares of a company
[SPEAKER_04]: and how folks can Can grow those you know
those relationships and and and find
[SPEAKER_04]: strategic partnerships that work for them
and their business do you have any insight
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely, I mean in addition to The
business side of things I think about the
[SPEAKER_02]: work that we're doing with the MCBA to
support and strengthen the social equity
[SPEAKER_02]: programs and economic development in every
community and strategic partnerships are
[SPEAKER_02]: really Critical for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen great examples in other
industries of companies stepping up and
[SPEAKER_02]: developing small business and
entrepreneurs and it lends itself to
[SPEAKER_02]: Innovation, you know and and really
growing and strengthening Those companies
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the examples I love to reference is
Unilever's acquisition of the sundial
[SPEAKER_02]: brand This is a an immigrant into the
United States who was basically making
[SPEAKER_02]: soap in his kitchen and he was using his
mother's recipe Unilever with all of their
[SPEAKER_02]: infrastructure and institutional knowledge
and access to money could not lock down
[SPEAKER_02]: the very lucrative black business black
Health and beauty business and so even
[SPEAKER_02]: when black women couldn't find these
products in traditional outlets and big
[SPEAKER_02]: box stores like Target and Walmart They
would purchase online and so sundial was I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean they were killing it and so Unilever
acquired this company significant
[SPEAKER_02]: Acquisition but in addition to that they
He demanded a strategic partnership that
[SPEAKER_02]: would support development and and support
entrepreneurs especially Women of color
[SPEAKER_02]: and so they contributed 50 million dollars
to the new voices fund in the new voices
[SPEAKER_02]: fund develops other Minority
entrepreneurs, especially women and so I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's important as I am going out
whether it's consulting and helping other
[SPEAKER_02]: folks build their businesses or the
strategic partnerships that I'm forming or
[SPEAKER_02]: the work that I'm doing with the MCBA to
look at industry and and help share that
[SPEAKER_02]: story as a real example Of how the
industry can get behind the initiatives
[SPEAKER_02]: that we are fighting for, you know We we
put policies in place to ensure access to
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry to ensure that there's a
place for folks that have been impacted by
[SPEAKER_02]: the war on drugs, but we're not putting
any money behind them and if one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: you know Most significant barriers to
entry is access to capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to start there and the industry
itself will be more valuable And more
[SPEAKER_02]: prosperous through strategic partnerships
that support sustainable endeavors
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity and inclusion initiatives and
equity in this space Yes, thank you for
[SPEAKER_04]: those points.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to talk a little bit more
about the associations So I'd love for you
[SPEAKER_04]: to expand on the MCBA in just a little
bit, but I wanted to get Jamie's
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective on Working with investors,
you know or our partners in in a
[SPEAKER_04]: significant way that would make them a
strategic partner deal Do you have any
[SPEAKER_04]: insight to share on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of insight to share on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been happening with bang for the
last few years We've got some of our
[SPEAKER_03]: investors sitting in the audience that we
met at this very event in Kauai last year
[SPEAKER_03]: Through them they've introduced us to
other people that we've connected with and
[SPEAKER_03]: I I do feel like when they're synergies or
when you can complement each other's needs
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wins And I think that's one of
the things that bang looks for in a
[SPEAKER_03]: strategic partnership is if you have a
need that We can fill and we have a need
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can fill You know, that's
obviously where a partnership starts from
[SPEAKER_03]: but then you also have to like each other
at a basic level you have to know that
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody's going to get along and play
well in the sandbox and You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think to Shanita's point If you're going
to make a strategic partnership and if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're out looking for a partner,
it's you have to be looking for ways to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually include the people that don't get
of or don't have a voice or don't get to
[SPEAKER_03]: play in the sandbox and I'm one of the
things I'm proud of with bang is we're out
[SPEAKER_03]: there looking for exactly that so we've
we've made some strategic partnerships
[SPEAKER_03]: that are You know like Kim Rivers in truly
is a woman-owned business women represent
[SPEAKER_03]: a larger percentage of ownership and
Executive positions in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still not representative of you know
population.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not there yet I think of Ruth Bader
Ginsburg saying she'll be happy when
[SPEAKER_03]: there's All women on the Supreme Court and
people say what she says what we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: question when it was all men, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're looking for inclusion and
we're getting it in this industry But but
[SPEAKER_03]: bangs out there looking for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So out of our entire executive team
Everybody's a woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have women of color except for Kim We
have two men on our team.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really proud of that So we're out
there looking for ways that we can Act
[SPEAKER_03]: actively find people that are doing good
things you know sustainable packaging and
[SPEAKER_03]: Just you know helping the environment
helping You know people that don't have a
[SPEAKER_03]: voice and I think that's I'm really like
proud to be sitting here with you because
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that you said that Kevin would you
like to add to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Capital is a huge thing in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of money to set up a
successful business And so one thing we
[SPEAKER_00]: like to do is to be a strategic partner
for our clients You know one thing I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to always say is I want to be the wheel
and I like to leverage Other service
[SPEAKER_00]: providers to be spokes again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know all the answers, but I want
to be able to help my clients to really
[SPEAKER_00]: grow to the next level To obtain capital
you have to be a strong business not in
[SPEAKER_00]: just what your product is But you have to
have strong financials You have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: reliable financials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have audits So,
you know, those are things that we kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: offer to our clients as well as Helping
them with the internal controls and
[SPEAKER_00]: processes To be able to properly navigate
and capture accurate information to
[SPEAKER_00]: address compliance regulatory requirements
You know, even filling out a proper tax
[SPEAKER_00]: return 280e is a killer in this industry
And so how do we properly navigate that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really I look at strategic
partnerships is absolutely crucial in all
[SPEAKER_00]: levels for all of us to help businesses
get stronger and grow To connect the
[SPEAKER_00]: investors with the businesses so they can
grow and so really we like to work
[SPEAKER_00]: together With our clients to kind of help
them Obtain that capital so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: really move to the next level Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so yeah, I would like to circle back
to associations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that she needed talked a little bit
about MCBA and and as you all know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I I work with the California Cannabis
Industry Association and we're a
[SPEAKER_04]: traditional 501 c6 so we're a lobbying
group and I think about strategic
[SPEAKER_04]: partnerships a little bit differently
because we we have partnerships Obviously
[SPEAKER_04]: with our members, right we represent them
and we work with them and and to be honest
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where all of the expertise and the
policy, you know platform and legislative
[SPEAKER_04]: priorities that all comes from our members
So I really like to think of our members
[SPEAKER_04]: or clients, you know as as our strategic
partners because there's there's that
[SPEAKER_04]: give-and-take of information and sharing
and and I would I know so much more about
[SPEAKER_04]: how their businesses function and the
issues that they're facing because of
[SPEAKER_04]: their ability to Share that with me,
which is great, but I also think about
[SPEAKER_04]: strategic partnerships with the
legislature and with the regulators and
[SPEAKER_04]: the amount of time that we have put into
building relationships with those entities
[SPEAKER_04]: and how sometimes they go sideways and
they're They're not as as strong as as we
[SPEAKER_04]: would want them to be or they don't hear
the real concerns of the industry But then
[SPEAKER_04]: other times we're incredibly proud of
those you know those relationships because
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a real give-and-take there in
terms of us sharing the expertise from the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry with them And so we see great
opportunity with that when we're working
[SPEAKER_04]: with a legislator that comes to us and
says hey I'd really like to have a bill
[SPEAKER_04]: that Regulates cannabis in this way and we
say hey, have you ever gone to a
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation site and seen cannabis
growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you do you know how it's harvested?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know how it's processed?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what extraction looks like and
when honestly four or five years ago most
[SPEAKER_04]: of The legislators that wanted to be a
part of the conversation and have bills
[SPEAKER_04]: with their names attached to it And and be
you know part of regulating they did not
[SPEAKER_04]: have that experience So that that piece of
it I've been really grateful that we've
[SPEAKER_04]: been able to build those relationships and
share the expertise from people who are
[SPEAKER_04]: actually Working in the industry to build
what I consider to be strategic
[SPEAKER_04]: partnerships And you know sometimes like I
said they they go wrong we have
[SPEAKER_04]: legislators that introduce bills and
language that We are absolutely not
[SPEAKER_04]: supportive of and that they're going to
create more You know regulatory headaches
[SPEAKER_04]: for the industry, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal is is that we would like to be
treated like any other industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: right and not regulated to death
California is dealing with some real
[SPEAKER_04]: growing pains right now in this regard But
I think it's important to think about
[SPEAKER_04]: partnerships in many different ways So I
know we've had some partnerships that have
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of gone I won't say sideways,
but it caused real consternation and we've
[SPEAKER_04]: had to fight to Remedy them and so I would
love for any perspective that you have on
[SPEAKER_04]: a strategic partnership that maybe was
fruitful at one point But has gone a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit sideways and then we can talk a
little bit more about associations Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you things happen so quickly and
you have to foresee and plan for you know
[SPEAKER_02]: a number of scenarios and so for the MCBA
we just really don't have time to Expend a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of energy around things that aren't
working So we're we're very quick to say
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, this isn't working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go in a different direction and it's
been really a rewarding for these
[SPEAKER_02]: strategic partnerships to result in things
like our model legislation and so for the
[SPEAKER_02]: last three years We've brought together,
you know a group of folks 30 to 40
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals that represent industry
policymakers regulators activists medical
[SPEAKER_02]: professionals and and we've spent You know
two days together saying what would an
[SPEAKER_02]: ideal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Adult use bill look like what does a
municipal ordinance look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it a municipal ordinance look like
that will ensure equity and access and
[SPEAKER_02]: diverse business types and things of that
nature tax a tax structure that lends
[SPEAKER_02]: itself to real community reinvestment as
opposed to collecting taxes into a general
[SPEAKER_02]: fund and then spending them on you know
Big industry development projects as
[SPEAKER_02]: opposed to education or health care or any
of the other things that are needed in
[SPEAKER_02]: these communities And so the strategic
partnerships that we have and just great
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships that we have with folks like
DPA SSDP MPP It's been helpful to us in
[SPEAKER_02]: our cause Our company partnerships have
allowed us to do a lot of programming
[SPEAKER_02]: around education provide resources to
folks Marley Natchez And privateer was a
[SPEAKER_02]: great relationship that allowed us to go
and do expungement fairs in Seattle and
[SPEAKER_02]: Portland We we had an opportunity summit
last year that was a direct result of a
[SPEAKER_02]: strategic partnership with Hoben Law Group
and University of Denver we are really
[SPEAKER_02]: excited to continue our partnership with
state associations like CCIA and Really
[SPEAKER_02]: excited about some upcoming work with new
organizations like CTF and so we're Going
[SPEAKER_02]: to continue to work with folks that are
interested in pushing forth the the
[SPEAKER_02]: general agenda But that are also concerned
with making sure that no one's left behind
[SPEAKER_02]: Ensuring that folks that look like me that
have been caught up in the criminal
[SPEAKER_02]: justice system Just don't have a million
dollars to bankroll this amazing idea that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're represented that they have
connectivity to the larger and and and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know more prevalent operators that are you
know multi-state And even international
[SPEAKER_02]: and so again strategic partnerships with
our individual members our company members
[SPEAKER_02]: and then other associations Are how we get
our work done?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Jamie We go into every strategic
partnership hoping it's going to go well I
[SPEAKER_03]: would say We've had some that have gone
really really well and we've had some that
[SPEAKER_03]: have not gone really really well and some
of the ones That I look back on and they
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't been successful They started off
You know with the right intentions,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think what's important when you when
you enter that partnership I always say
[SPEAKER_03]: write your divorce before you get married
Because when you're in the beginning of
[SPEAKER_03]: that process and you're getting ready to
join forces Everybody's in the ether of
[SPEAKER_03]: the excitement of the deal well That's
when it's really easy to actually sit with
[SPEAKER_03]: them and say well, okay Let's talk about
all the ways this can go wrong and get it
[SPEAKER_03]: on paper and be ready to Know what it's
going to look like if you have to partner
[SPEAKER_03]: In different ways because the reality of
being in business in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's complicated It changes all the time
people have different expectations in
[SPEAKER_03]: their heads when they join into
partnerships, so as things change and
[SPEAKER_03]: evolve It's easier now, and we've learned
the hard way You got to be able to cut
[SPEAKER_03]: loose quick If things aren't going well,
so it's sort of like these you know be
[SPEAKER_03]: slow to hire and quick to fire What we're
trying to do now is really write our
[SPEAKER_03]: partnerships in a way where they're not as
painful to To you know separate from if
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't work because the reality is
they don't always work We've been lucky
[SPEAKER_03]: because the ones that we've done.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've learned a lot We've been doing this
for nine years, and we've been doing it
[SPEAKER_03]: majority the majority of our efforts have
been in partnership Situations because we
[SPEAKER_03]: have all of that experience in there We've
been really lucky because we've honed the
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to figure out also How to ask good
questions of ourselves Because if I know
[SPEAKER_03]: what I really am looking for if I know
what I really do need and I know where my
[SPEAKER_03]: pain points are I can ask the right
questions to make sure that we're actually
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't just like each other and want to
do business together But we're actually
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be benefiting one another and
there's going to be a result for me and a
[SPEAKER_03]: result for you That we're both expecting
so you know I would say in all of those
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones that don't work are painful and
some more painful than others And I'm sure
[SPEAKER_03]: you all know what I mean by that,
but the ones that have been Successful
[SPEAKER_03]: make it worth it, so I would I would say
even though we've had some some
[SPEAKER_03]: partnerships go south Strategic
partnerships that win-win when it does
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful thing Great, thank you So
I don't really have many strategic
[SPEAKER_00]: partnerships that have gone bad But there
is you know I want to bring up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know working with clients You know
things will be going really well They're
[SPEAKER_00]: really liking everything you're bringing
to the table the value you're adding and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we get to the topic of 280e And then
I look like a bad guy It's very hard for
[SPEAKER_00]: us as accountants to help Clients properly
navigate that because they don't like to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear what 280e really is Nobody nobody
does and it's hard because they all look
[SPEAKER_00]: at me like I wrote the Code and and and
it's just like no my job is to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you stay in your lanes, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I disagree with the rule I know a lot of
my clients use that almost as their
[SPEAKER_00]: Strategy for how they make business
decisions, and I try to change their
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective just like look Let's focus on
what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing and how we can grow our top
line and manage costs But don't have a tax
[SPEAKER_00]: law Drive what you're gonna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not everything is cost of goods sold
because you're a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just isn't the way it is So I have to
be the bearer of bad news a lot and and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of hard To kind of bring that
to the table, but again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just try to tell them that look this is
about really building an empire in this
[SPEAKER_00]: space and what you need to do is follow
compliance and the Regulations and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why I say this is a very expensive
industry to kind of get into And you just
[SPEAKER_00]: got to hold it out until that is lifted
and eventually it will be lifted I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know when but I do know that as long as
you can Kind of successfully navigate that
[SPEAKER_00]: and just withhold That's when you're gonna
be sitting pretty you don't want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: under over aggressively Bypassing any of
the rules and right now the rules are
[SPEAKER_00]: strict And I would just recommend to
everyone do your best to follow the rules
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's going to keep you open We
all know there's going to be an inevitable
[SPEAKER_00]: consolidation within this industry And
it's those that are really following
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance and doing things as right as
they can within the states in which
[SPEAKER_00]: they're operating That will be the last
one standing Great well, I know we do want
[SPEAKER_04]: to move into some questions So I'm gonna
ask each of the panelists to share
[SPEAKER_04]: something that they're that they're really
particularly proud of and it can be based
[SPEAKER_04]: around a strategic partnership or an
accomplishment But I'd love to hear a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit about something that you're
particularly proud of and I'm gonna start
[SPEAKER_00]: with you Kevin So I'm just proud to do my
part for this industry to thrive I'm very
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see where it goes And so I
just love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my part and it's great when you
know I work with a client and we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: things and and Really help them dial in
some framework that they're seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: value and the other day I just had a
comment We wouldn't be where we're at
[SPEAKER_00]: today without you and those are the things
that just make me feel incredibly proud
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just an industry bait built by
incredible people And I'm just thrilled to
[SPEAKER_00]: be part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible who would have thought
that today we'd be where we're at I would
[SPEAKER_00]: have never guessed and it's really because
of Associations and entrepreneurs and
[SPEAKER_00]: business owners that have paved the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: She needed Today I am most proud of a
strategic partnership that was born out of
[SPEAKER_02]: a relationship that I formed in the
advocacy space Amber Center of Supernovas
[SPEAKER_02]: Women who's based here in Oakland and I
have spent the last few years Bouncing
[SPEAKER_02]: ideas off each other from the East Coast
to the West Coast around what social
[SPEAKER_02]: equity and economic empowerment truly
looks like Last year we came together and
[SPEAKER_02]: we now have a license for a non storefront
retail delivery business here in Oakland
[SPEAKER_02]: or in Oakland and We are also incubating a
social equity delivery Licensee and so,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we didn't have a big budget
backing us But we realized that as we
[SPEAKER_02]: built our business that we could help
another business another person who needs
[SPEAKER_02]: not just a check but actual support in
navigating this industry all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: hurdles that are you know come in the way
of just starting up operations But also
[SPEAKER_02]: making sure that our voices are
Continuously heard at the city level to
[SPEAKER_02]: ensure that this program Is further
developed, you know, it's not enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: just say hey, we're giving you a thousand
square feet And so that is incubation of a
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not you know You need real support
you need access to capital and you need
[SPEAKER_02]: folks that are committed to developing and
seeing these businesses thrive So today
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say that's my the proudest strategic
partnership that I'm that I can think of
[SPEAKER_03]: right now Jamie for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely the deep friendships that
I've developed over the five years That
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in the industry You know coming
from real estate where it's really a dog
[SPEAKER_03]: eat dog situation We're all fighting for
the same houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all fighting for the same deals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Found that the cannabis industry,
you know not to get all kumbaya but the
[SPEAKER_03]: reality is I come to this I come to the
ICBC and I run into people that I haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: seen for a while and it's like running
into an old friend and and now I realize
[SPEAKER_03]: they have really become my friends the
people that I'm Doing business with we are
[SPEAKER_03]: so like-minded That that's what I'm proud
of is being able to build the
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships that I've been able to build
in such a short amount of time That are
[SPEAKER_03]: really really deep friendships that I know
will continue if I jump out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry or not That's what I'm proud of
That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, whether we like it or not,
we're all part of this movement right this
[SPEAKER_04]: this greater entity that is Slowly,
but surely changing the world and I think
[SPEAKER_04]: it's extraordinary that we get to think
about business and regulation and
[SPEAKER_04]: partnerships while also always thinking
about social justice and and really
[SPEAKER_04]: continuing on the legacy of folks who Who
have been fighting for a really long time
[SPEAKER_04]: to finally end Prohibition and we're
getting so close You know, I mean I look
[SPEAKER_04]: back at January 1st in 2018 and I cried
really hard that day and then I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh wait, California's a mess But it's
still you know, like that that is still
[SPEAKER_04]: the motivator I think for so many of us
and I hope that we Never lose that I know
[SPEAKER_04]: that we're gonna maybe move further away
But I hope we can keep that core and keep
[SPEAKER_04]: that that excitement and that trust with
our strategic partnerships because really
[SPEAKER_04]: when we're able to leverage those
partnerships to elevate our Association or
[SPEAKER_04]: our business or our brand?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hope that we're also elevating the
folks that we're working with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where I think we have the most
Growth potential and and the ability to
[SPEAKER_04]: change the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's keep that in mind and we are at
close to end if there are Questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's hear it one more time for the panel
though, Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_01]: She need a Jamie Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just popped up out of nowhere You're
good at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have time for a couple of questions for
sure anyone anyone
