[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Marcus Richardson, aka The Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been popularizing Pioneer Water Hash
for about 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the industry for a very long
time, hemp activism, medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, of course, recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been coming to ICBC pretty much since
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex is a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known him since back in the days in
Amsterdam, 25-plus years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always found that Alex has done
an amazing job at ICBC, bringing together
[SPEAKER_00]: the corporates and the legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, helping push regulations,
helping inform and educate governments,
[SPEAKER_00]: and different groups that are going to,
you know, obviously be requiring to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what this industry requires and
what this industry could look like if we
[SPEAKER_00]: all sort of got behind and pushed it
through the way it needs to be pushed
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different from shows in Canada,
in the sense that, you know, Berlin is
[SPEAKER_00]: second to none for a cannabis show.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of companies and people that
arrive from corporate entities,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pharma companies, but also from legacy
seed readers and growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without ICBC, there would really be no
platform for so many of us to gather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is truly the conversations that
happen at ICBC are the conversations that
[SPEAKER_00]: will shape the future of the cannabis
world that we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We blessed y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big up!
Thank you.
