[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an inspiring keynote this course is
going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm going to do with you in the next
couple of minutes is I'm going to discuss
[SPEAKER_01]: with you what happened for the last five
years regarding the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the challenges?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the pitfalls?
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course we're going to discuss also
a little bit more in detail what will be
[SPEAKER_01]: the future with regard to the recreation
market, at least from my point of view,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the point of view of a lawyer who
is involved in the business since 2016 and
[SPEAKER_01]: the life sciences field lawyer for over 20
years, 30 years in practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I came here this morning I had
a radio interview with a German
[SPEAKER_01]: broadcaster and the interviewer surprised
me with the following question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter, we have a room, we have a look at
your, at the dentist's home page and we
[SPEAKER_01]: found the following slogan.
[SPEAKER_01]: However you need to grow, dentist is here
to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you take that idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly speaking a lot of marketing
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to a certain extent it was a surprise
because I didn't know about the slogan
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to answer that a little bit
more in detail and what we're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, and here's what the German
speaker usually presents the agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: An overview of the historical facts,
very briefly because you all know what
[SPEAKER_01]: happened in Germany in the last five years
and how we actually developed the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: market for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking into the liberalization
process, some milestones, only very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly some real headlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has happened in these five years to
the German market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about the pitfalls, the market
situation for medical cannabis as of today
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we developed over the last couple
of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we come to the, you are all very,
very interested in the liberalization
[SPEAKER_01]: process for legal cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look into the timeline,
you see that we have actually the
[SPEAKER_01]: liberalization in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: In March the decision of the Federal
Administrative Court to restrict the
[SPEAKER_01]: liberalization was in 2016 and of course
then we have the whole concept of a legal
[SPEAKER_00]: environment building up regulatory
frameworks for the respective medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: In April 2019, the Federal Institute for
Drugs and Medical Devices, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: B-Farm, which you all know, actually
granted them three licenses to German
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators, which we all know,
Demica, Obama, and Hafria, with a very
[SPEAKER_00]: limited extent to cultivate cannabis in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 10.6 metric tons over a period of
five years, which is by far not enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: serve the market, as you can see later on
in my presentation, but at least it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, of course, why only 10.6
tons for four years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the B-Farm is actually purchasing
the flowers from the three licenses of
[SPEAKER_00]: uses and sending it directly to the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they are not using own
warehouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have used and appointed Kanzatiba to
do that for the B-Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have been extremely conservative
with regard to what is actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount, the quantity, which will be needed
for the medical market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is definitely less than what the market
needs, and of course, Germany will remain
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the largest importers for medical
cannabis in the next years as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to make just a very brief
discourse here, which was a decision of
[SPEAKER_00]: the European Court of Justice of November
2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't usually have to do with the
medical cannabis market, because it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the European Court of Justice actually
classified CBD as not being narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has known to be implemented in the
United States legislation, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a big step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a step forward into the legalization
of cannabis and cannabis-related products.
[SPEAKER_00]: As such, I have mentioned that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will come back to that in a minute at
the end of my presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a look into the milestones,
which we have seen in the last five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these are the rebate contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rebate contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are rebate contracts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmaceutical manufacturers, and that's
common in Germany, grant health insurance
[SPEAKER_00]: certain rebates for dispensing their
dispense, and in return get an exclusivity
[SPEAKER_00]: in the supplier for these health insurance
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you have to know as a background is,
once a patient has applied to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: this position for reimbursement of the
respective cannabis treatment,
[SPEAKER_00]: he will get the reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, he will be paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets reimbursed for the cannabis for
his failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, the health insurance
companies have, of course, a very close
[SPEAKER_00]: look into the expenses of these respective
treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what has happened here, as at the
beginning of the liberalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you may know that, the price on a per
gram basis in 2017 and 2018 was around 22
[SPEAKER_00]: euros for the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was around 10 to 12 euros from the
wholesaler to the pharmacy, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacy had to add 100% surcharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the product was qualified as an
extemporaneous mid-chain, not as a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the consequence, the price died.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, of course, an issue with the
respective health insurance companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the association of health insurance
companies and the associations of
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacists have actually found a
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have kept the price from the
wholesaler to the pharmacy, at 952 euros
[SPEAKER_00]: per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the surcharge applies, and of course,
there's a staggering process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The surcharge will apply very much
depending on the quantity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the first time a real price
regulation mechanism has entered the
[SPEAKER_00]: market here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened as well was that,
due to the competition of the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: the price really went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a per gram basis, from this 952 to six,
seven euros per gram, even below that,
[SPEAKER_00]: over time, for the medicinal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the health insurance
companies had the idea of, why don't we
[SPEAKER_00]: apply the same system, which we have for
ready-made pharmaceuticals, also to the
[SPEAKER_00]: extemporaneous mixtures being catalysts?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why these rebate contracts actually
came into force, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some companies, since we have
entered into these rebate contracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the respective health insurance
companies, and others may also join,
[SPEAKER_00]: because these are so-called open house
contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another milestone was the application of
the so-called AMRAT found in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are talking here about the probability
of irradiation of the plants in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly reduce the microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2019, one of our clients has asked us,
what do I have to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I actually import irradiated
cannabis flowers from Canada into Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to the performance as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually said, well, you just file the
application for the importation license
[SPEAKER_00]: for this specific lot with your local
authority, or just mention that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: irradiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The client actually imported it in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2018, this cannabis-irradiated cannabis
was introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, in 2019, the big firm
actually decided, well, I think we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: grant a specific license under the AMRAT
found, which is the respective law here,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the irradiation of the cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to file and import a form of
the specific license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was totally new.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you refer to the respective
legislation, to the respective law,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is applicable for where you make your
suitcases, not for extemporaneous
[SPEAKER_00]: mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was actually applied one-to-one
by the big firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody applied for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the respective
licenses have been granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the reason for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Difficult to say, hypothetically,
well, the license is relatively expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's actually for each and every
product which you're going to import.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to the next milestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to the mid-float, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the various licenses which she
just listed, which you need if you would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to enter the German market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you need to have a
manufacturing permit, a products permit,
[SPEAKER_00]: import permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the wholesale license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advertising is not really allowed,
because it's very, very limited how well
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, as I said, these products are
extemporaneous mixtures, not for any of
[SPEAKER_00]: your suitcases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to do business here,
intuitively, you have to either establish
[SPEAKER_00]: your own company and apply for these
licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timeline, approximately one-sixth,
if you're lucky, very much depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the local authority where you are located.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you'll find a company who has already
the existing licenses for the import,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to enter into a
respective agreement with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, for most exporters, the best way
to do it if you want to reach the market
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we are currently discussing,
and you should know a bit more,
[SPEAKER_00]: are the quality standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a relatively new but very
intense discussion for German companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The precondition for importing products
from a country outside of Germany is,
[SPEAKER_00]: first of all, that the country of origin
adheres to the 1961 U.N.
[SPEAKER_00]: Civil Convention, which stipulates that we
have to have a formal licensing process
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cultivation and the export,
a controlled process for the export,
[SPEAKER_00]: for medicinal cannabis, or for cannabis
for scientific purposes, not for
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational, and we'll come back to that
in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this qualification has been checked,
then, of course, the exporter,
[SPEAKER_00]: the exporting company has to fulfill EUGMP
regulations in the process, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, the products have as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are an exporter from Canada,
you may obtain a GMP certificate locally,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, of course, is not recognized within
the European Union, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: and by the German authorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a German officer from the
German authorities has to do an on-site
[SPEAKER_00]: inspection in order to see whether the
company, in Canada, qualifies under the
[SPEAKER_00]: EUGMP regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not necessary for all those
countries where we have a mutual
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition agreement in place between
Germany and, of course, the respective
[SPEAKER_00]: country, which, folks, is, for example,
applicable for Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any kind of GMP certificate in Australia
from an exporter company is automatically
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized within the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you can see right now here is the
overlap of GACP and GEP, and that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: the discussion starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, the respective company,
the exporter, in a third country has to
[SPEAKER_00]: adhere to the EUGMP regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are requirements right now that they
can actually export GACP processed
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, for example, flowers,
into Germany, which are then GMP processed
[SPEAKER_00]: here and then sold to the German market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, as some of the representatives of
these companies were doing it said,
[SPEAKER_00]: disruptive, a disruptive new idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, is it covered by the
respective legal framework?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question because we have an
overlap between GACP and GMP and the grace
[SPEAKER_00]: on in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pre-drying process is definitely a
process which can be done under GACP.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really drying process is, of course,
there must be GMP compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the BIFON just recently, in connection
with a clarification regarding the UNRAT
[SPEAKER_00]: fault provisions, has stated that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as clear as before it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, however, we are still in the
discussion that you can actually import
[SPEAKER_00]: into Germany or export from outside GACP
processed flowers, which are then GMP
[SPEAKER_00]: processed, further GMP processed here in
Germany and then sold to the pharmacies,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is currently the case for some
imports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look into the online trade of
medicine and flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, online trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you sell cannabis products online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can pharmacies actually send to pharmacies
a product with you, the respective patient
[SPEAKER_00]: by career services?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer to that is, in principle,
that is possible, as it is possible for
[SPEAKER_00]: all other Rx products, pharmaceutical
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you have to adhere to certain
preconditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the prescription needs to be
sent to the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't send a product with my career to
the patient with careers collecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription to bring it back to the
pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first of all, the prescription has to
be sent by the patient to the pharmacy by
[SPEAKER_00]: mail, which is actually the case for other
Rx products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the pharmacy can actually send
the product to the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patient doesn't have to appear in the
pharmacy, which makes it easier for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients to select which pharmacy is going
to buy his product, which has been
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribed by the physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very helpful tool, and we have seen that
currently, a large number of the
[SPEAKER_00]: respective distribution is done via this
online trading, where patients are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually ordering their products,
sending the respective prescription to the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacies and receiving the package.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, the career service has to
fulfill certain preconditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't send just any bicycle career
center with a package of cannabis to a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are, of course, the larger
forwarding companies like DHL,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, who can provide these
services, knowing what is in the package,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's come to the market situation
currently in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you see, in 2019, the Bayfarm awarded
the contracts for the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The respective quality standards have to
be adhered.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first harvest by Ofria actually was
done in July 2021, with a small extent of
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 kilogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the first harvest of DemiCarm was 100
kilograms back in April 2022, just
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, then also Aurora has made
their first harvest available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two concept here, which is a distribution
company called Bayfarm, in May 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's slightly developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not there yet, because for various
delays, which are, of course, also caused
[SPEAKER_00]: by the respective pandemic, which has
slowed down cultivation processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivators didn't gather respective
materials for the cultivation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here, the total volume is only 10.4
tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had that in mind for four years,
which can be exceeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be increased by 10% for each
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do we stand right now in the
medicinal cannabis market?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look into 2017,
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual demand estimated by the Federal
Opioid Agency was 10.4 tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, 2017 was the year that the
liberalization took place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 1.77 tons were actually imported.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018 did increase significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2019, of course, and 2020 and 2021,
I think that is a significant increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2021, we had an import of medicinal
cannabis products of a large 20 metric
[SPEAKER_00]: tons, which is a market belonging to the
largest market in Europe compared to other
[SPEAKER_00]: markets in Canada or in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still relatively small, but
increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, of course,
where is this market going?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say we are looking into an
increased number of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a look into the patient
numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the patient numbers, we are,
from different sources you see,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be about 80 to 100,000 patients
per year within Germany, which is far less
[SPEAKER_00]: than the initial hopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see, which we are actually at 1% of
the population, which would have been
[SPEAKER_00]: 800,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably will not reach that figure,
but we will have seen an increasing
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said, currently, my father is in
this market in Europe compared to other
[SPEAKER_00]: markets like the Netherlands, Poland,
or Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having all said that about the
medicinal market, which to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: extent may be known to you maybe a little
bit more, now comes the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we looking into the legalization
for recreational cannabis in Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me look into the respective
process right now, which we have heard
[SPEAKER_00]: from Mr. Frieder, is I would say the
relatively kind of stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, cannabis for non-medical
purposes is non-marketable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a non-marketable narcotic substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to change the roles with
respect to the consumption for
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the market size?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have estimates who actually say that
the market, the illicit market right now
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the region of 700 metric tons per
year, which in comparison to the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: market is significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at how actually the market
for the liberalization would develop then,
[SPEAKER_00]: if let's say 50% of the total market could
be served by a regulated market for
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational purposes, we are talking
about 350 metric tons, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: significant in comparison to the current
market for recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, the caution of the lawmaker
in that process is understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original process for the
liberalization of medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't really a masterpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a lot of gray areas, a lot of
unregulated areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we have seen, for example, with the
irrigation process, but other processes as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the lawmaker would like to make it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a certain reluctance to speed
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the demand is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black market, the illicit market,
is there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a danger for us, which we have to
attack, as we heard this morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the subpoena, as well as the
protection, of course, of the young
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has to be taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what is the timeline?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in May, Karl-Albert Graf,
the Federal Minister for Health,
[SPEAKER_00]: announced the plan that the draft law,
it doesn't say that it will be law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say that it has been agreed by
the Parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been released as a law.
[SPEAKER_00]: The draft law will then be forwarded in
September.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the second half of 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard this morning that this plan is
already a little bit extended to the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably, it may be even at the end of the
second quarter 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the whole process
starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, as a lawyer, I like to add
that this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the legislation process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just we put the draft into
the Parliament and then we agree on it and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It very much depends, of course,
on the drafting of the respective
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We assume that this is a consent bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means the Bundesrat, which is our
second chamber, where the majority is by
[SPEAKER_00]: the majority of press developments,
which is the more conservative side and
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very critical with regard to the
liberalisation, has the majority.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means we may have another meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So altogether, I would say that we will
not have a final law for liberalisation of
[SPEAKER_00]: colourless for adult recreational purposes
in place before the end of second,
[SPEAKER_00]: third or fourth quarter 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is kind of a natural process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's here for it, the first draft
will be in 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then, of course, this whole process
here starts and we will see how quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be done and whether the
Bundesrat, of course, is giving its
[SPEAKER_00]: consent or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It very much depends, of course,
on the discussion between the various
[SPEAKER_00]: parties and how we actually would like to
adopt liberalisation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we come to the potential
obstacles, which I would like to address
[SPEAKER_00]: here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some summary of just what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go a little further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll wait a little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there will be a few more people
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what is important are the legal
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, of course, Germany is
part of multiple international treaties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we spoke about that, I think,
during the last ICBC event.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 1961 UN Single Convention and other
two conventions are restricting the
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer of narcotics between its member
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 180 countries have signed off on
those treaties, which means that you
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot just import cannabis from Holland,
Canada or any other country for
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be immediately in violation of
the 1961 UN Single Convention.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the theoretical consequences of
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The International Narcotics Control Board,
which is the executive control board for
[SPEAKER_00]: the conventions, is empowered to monitor
the compliance with the respective
[SPEAKER_00]: conventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, they are sending
in the quotas for the importation also for
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, there has never been a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't discussed at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the data in 2021 actually has
increased its demand over the period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2021, it has asked the INCB to adopt
and to grant the commission to import the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger amounts, which have been granted
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without the commission of the INCB,
even for the respective medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, you are not allowed to import
these products to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the practical consequences of a
violation could be that the INCB is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to initiate a force mechanism,
which they haven't done in the case of
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada and Uruguay, who entered the
recreational park as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are in a position to reduce the
quota also for the medicinal cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which they haven't done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not really reacted so far,
neither in the case of Canada or Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will see what they may or may not
say about the possible cultivation of
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis in Germany,
which would be one solution that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming back to that agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, the Schengen Convention.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the EU framework, which of course
all EU countries are part of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know Schengen Contract, everybody
talks about Schengen Contract when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to past, present, and immigration
and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Germany, who has a very small
cultivation for medicinal cannabis at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point in time, can not just, without
violating the respective EU conventions
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Schengen Convention, import these
products into Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would the government do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to find a way to solve that
issue, which is to be addressed this
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we get the cannabis from for the
recreational market, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we do homegrown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we do cultivation in Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we ask the three licensed producers
right now to significantly increase their
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities, which they to a certain extent
may or may not do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we inviting others to join the
cultivation in Germany, which would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility to say, well, we have about 10
to make it out, no more 10, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they find 10, it was really,
really difficult, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we invite respective interested
parties to cultivate cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational purposes in Germany if they
fulfill certain requirements to make up
[SPEAKER_00]: the license.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have seen that happening in the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 10 companies there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just recently being granted the permission
to grow cannabis for recreational purposes
[SPEAKER_00]: for the domestic use within the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see here one of those solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other solutions may be, of course,
the respective change of the convention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't think that you will get all
the countries to very quickly agree to a
[SPEAKER_00]: change of that convention.
[SPEAKER_00]: To terminate the convention, step out and
apply again with the permission that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis doesn't be applicable for
Germany, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know whether the other 180 or
179 countries will agree to that,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Few make it mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more practical solution definitely
is either we're talking about homegrown or
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about domestic cultivation
and the respective increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, we are talking about end
of 2024, because you have to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: process, despite the fact that you have
also to establish the respective
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure in order to have this
cannabis for recreational purposes,
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctively to the interest of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: The infrastructure is, we have heard about
this morning about licensed shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need somebody who is going to grant
the licenses, who is going to look and
[SPEAKER_00]: control the respective distribution
centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the infrastructure which you
have to set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a significant effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should have started that a little
bit earlier, probably, if we really would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to look into the respective results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see the challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, of course, how we can
attack the common, do we do
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalization like in Poland,
or do we really do legalization with
[SPEAKER_00]: respect to non-enforcement?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the solutions which I just
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: The open violation, I don't think that the
German government at this point in time
[SPEAKER_00]: will violate international treaties
immediately, as well as the sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's have a look into another issue
which we have to adhere to, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look into the recreational
market, from my point of view,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are three major factors in order to
make it successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is price.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have an adequate price.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have heard that this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I heard about taxation to a certain
extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that's an interesting income
for the government, but it has,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, an impact on the prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So price is the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly is availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product needs to be made available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should not drive 20 or 25 kilometers
to the next dispensing shop or license
[SPEAKER_00]: shop to get what you would like to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the infrastructure has to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So product availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last one, of course, is quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Price, availability, quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's the real issue.
Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have heard this morning from Mr. Peter,
the quality of the product on the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market is difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of products on the market
which are mixed with things which are
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, that is something which,
of course, we should attack the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is the right quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to GMP again?
[SPEAKER_00]: EU GMP, maybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would definitely be an advantage for
the recreational market if you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: right quality in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And GMP would be one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look into the challenges,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is an example of how the Canadian
market actually developed relative to the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical environment in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the medical market is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the respective liberalization,
it's declined significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the recreational cannabis actually
significantly increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't actually transfer that to Germany
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my point of view, and that's a
significant issue of the German market,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients get reimbursed if they get a
prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the same, to the same extent,
happening in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for some patients, it was much easier
to get into the recreational market than,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, going to the doctor and get a
prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we will definitely see is maybe a
slight decline or kind of a steady line
[SPEAKER_00]: with regard to the medical market and,
of course, then an increase of the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look into the next chart here,
which is the product price, you see that
[SPEAKER_00]: the product price for the innocent market
actually went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legal adult use market went up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, the medical market is to a
certain steady line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what I just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether this can be transferred to Germany
or we have to be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the challenges of the recreational
markets are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to work on a number of issues,
a number of problems, which I hope will
[SPEAKER_00]: have been addressed this morning in a
little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it looks like that the current
discussions are difficult and the current
[SPEAKER_00]: government may not be in a position to let
us participate in those discussions in
[SPEAKER_00]: more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that will be the case in the
near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I'm going to add my presentation,
I'm coming back to two slides with regard
[SPEAKER_00]: to the CBD market, which is an interesting
market for all participants in that field
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these three segments for CBD
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The so-called food supplement market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last but not least, the pharmaceutical
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cosmetic market is relatively easy
to enter in comparison to the food
[SPEAKER_00]: supplement market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: The European Commission actually decided
that any kind of food supplement which
[SPEAKER_00]: contains CBD is a novel food and falls
under the novel food convention.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the consequence that you have to
apply for the marketing of these products
[SPEAKER_00]: at the European Commission level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the European Food and Safety Authority
is the one who looks into the respective
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to provide data in regard to the
product, its hardness, it doesn't hurt at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what a number of companies did.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what happened is that the
European Food and Safety Authority earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: this year decided that they will not
proceed with any of those applications for
[SPEAKER_00]: food supplements due to the fact that they
do not have enough safety data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a significant setback for the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether this argumentation is justifiable,
probably yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Difficult to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it helpful for the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, the respective applicants are
now in a position that they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide more safety data and they may not
get an approval in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the collecting of safety data is
an enormous effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: The USA just recently, on 28th of June
2022, had an official hearing in which we
[SPEAKER_00]: participated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually pointed again out that
basically we are not in a position to
[SPEAKER_00]: grant any of this registration without
additional safety data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that is a setback for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to do anything with
medical information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to provide you with that latest
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is up and down with respect to the
liberalization also in the C&P market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that as well in the cannabis
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having said that, I really hope that the
German government is putting significant
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts into the next steps in order to
find a way to open the recreation market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say that we, to a certain
extent, should not be too optimistic,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least not even too enthusiastic about
the timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will come, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when is the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably sometime in 2024, we may have the
first products on the market, if we are
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for that bad news.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's more a realistic view than what
we have heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having said that, I would like to close my
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to thank the researchers for
putting together this excellent program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you very much for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
