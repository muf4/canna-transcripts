[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very excited to introduce our guest
here today, another California industry
[SPEAKER_03]: pioneer, to talk about some of your
insights and experiences in cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: financing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just kick it right off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want you to tell me a little bit
about yourself and your background and
[SPEAKER_03]: what brought you into cannabis investing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks Mary and thanks for having
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just attended the last conference at
London and that went very well and we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be at the conference in Zurich.
[SPEAKER_02]: We find these conferences very informative
to aggregate all the information that's
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in through the European markets and
basically everywhere outside of the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were the first dedicated lender in
the United States that was privately held
[SPEAKER_02]: doing bridge loans to cannabis use
specialty use properties in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to entering cannabis we've done
5,000 transactions for over 5 billion
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the skill set when our local
congressman Dana Rohrabacher passed the
[SPEAKER_02]: Rohrabacher Blumenauer Amendment which in
the United States was the most
[SPEAKER_02]: consequential legislation ever passed that
nobody ever talks about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That legislation defunded the Department
of Justice from any prosecution of a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis related business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when Congress used what we call the
power of the purse to take away the money
[SPEAKER_02]: from the Department of Justice from
prosecution, we quickly realized this was
[SPEAKER_02]: the largest newly created asset class in
the world of 50 billion dollars is now
[SPEAKER_02]: what we have been able to project out that
just the real estate asset class in the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started lending in the sector by
2016 and today we've done 69 transactions
[SPEAKER_02]: for 435 million with 34 payoffs.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've originated more transactions,
had more payoffs than any other lender and
[SPEAKER_02]: we've seen over 2,000 transactions in just
the cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also aggregated all that data to
have the most robust data sets of anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for giving us that great
background.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like 6 years is a short time but
in cannabis years it's a very long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about 10 years since the United
States started really getting into
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial cannabis for personal legal use
and 10 years into it, knowing what you
[SPEAKER_03]: know now, is there anything that you would
have done differently when you were
[SPEAKER_03]: getting started?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on the real estate side so we're not
owners in the cannabis equity businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tried to move into it as early as we
possibly could.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2014 was the year that that legislation
passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were actually trying to lend in 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just couldn't get our third party
service providers, title insurance,
[SPEAKER_02]: property insurance, our investors,
our legal team, our compliance,
[SPEAKER_02]: our errors and admissions insurance to
sign off on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being a leader in an industry is not
always about doing things in the most
[SPEAKER_02]: center of a circle, of it being the safest
in the center.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you need to be all the way to
the edge of the outer perimeter of that
[SPEAKER_02]: circle where you're on the edge of risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that circle of what risky is and what
is, being on the edge, is something that
[SPEAKER_02]: as you're a leader in an industry,
you're constantly redefining that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your ploris was the one that was
establishing getting the first FDIC
[SPEAKER_02]: insured warehouse lines of credits,
getting the first investment credit grade
[SPEAKER_02]: ratings in the industry, getting the first
institutional investors as a privately
[SPEAKER_02]: held fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that risk is perception.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have the data and the facts to
back you up, you can continually move that
[SPEAKER_02]: risk perspective out as long as you're
shoring it up with facts and data to
[SPEAKER_02]: de-risk the downside of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, I'm glad you brought up risk
because I actually wanted to talk to you a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, the economy is in a difficult
place right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got global inflation.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing to mitigate that risk?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you're speaking about a lot of
data, but what else are you doing to
[SPEAKER_03]: mitigate the risk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's two sides for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the borrower side and how we look
at risk there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's also what we're doing to
offset those costs on the investor side or
[SPEAKER_02]: the fund administration side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the borrower side, we want to
underwrite each of these transactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we look at the real estate as one part
of the equation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we call that the property company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we look at the cannabis business
side, the operating company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for the operating company,
when we look at these transactions,
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to make sure that they're an
existing, experienced operator.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't afford to work with somebody
that's just getting in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too complicated of an industry for us
to take that risk or for our borrower,
[SPEAKER_02]: the property owner to take that risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the second thing is for that real
estate, it has to be specialty purpose
[SPEAKER_02]: built for cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that requires certain licensing,
specific tenant improvements, specific
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment, specific power, specific water,
all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we want to do is we want to
underwrite 100% of all the costs that are
[SPEAKER_02]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't leave anything to guess or
speculation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we do an underwriting of a
transaction, we want to understand what's
[SPEAKER_02]: the total cost for the property purchase?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the total construction cost or
tenant improvements?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is the equipment that is
necessary to get that facility up and
[SPEAKER_02]: running?
[SPEAKER_02]: We underwrite 100% of what the costs are
required to get that all the way to being
[SPEAKER_02]: a cash flowing facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, we'll typically lend
up to 60% of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the borrowers need to know that they
need to come up with 40%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the difference between us and a
traditional bank, and by the way,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll talk about banking in a second in
the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference with us is we're a cost
basis lender.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to look at that 100% cost
basis of all those things, the acquisition
[SPEAKER_02]: costs, the tenant improvement,
construction, and equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to count that as 100% cost
basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll go up to 60% of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas banks or other lenders are only
going to look at the real estate value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 99% of all of them are going to look
at what's called the alternative use,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is not cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that value is probably going to be
half of what the valuation is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is traditional finance in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 704 depositor, FDIC insured,
federal and state banks out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's four dozen banks that are
traditional banks that are lending,
[SPEAKER_02]: including ours in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So believe it or not, as much as you may
hear differently, out of the 2,000
[SPEAKER_02]: transactions we've looked at since 2014,
we've never seen one transaction that
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have banking in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it did, it would be a massive red flag
to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is banking out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's typically state banking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any bank in the US can accept cannabis
deposits if they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't have the compliance to
risk their banking license to accept that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The banks that are doing it, they have
their own specific compliance department
[SPEAKER_02]: for each state.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're charging for that deposit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine paying money to make a deposit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually 0.2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have higher banking fees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's robust banking out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, all these cannabis
operators are entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our goal is to take whatever equity
that you've raised and take it as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you're doing that initial
equity raise, it's the worst possible
[SPEAKER_02]: valuation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your lowest valuation possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to minimize what equity you
need to raise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to come to us and understand,
how much equity do I need to raise so that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not selling too much of my company too
early?
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it sounds like your model is
working.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate all that you've done
to really help a lot of these companies
[SPEAKER_03]: get a start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was so difficult in the
beginning to get investors or to get a
[SPEAKER_03]: loan or to get banking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what drew you into being one of the
first when there wasn't really very many
[SPEAKER_03]: people that were already doing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wish I had some awesome story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of my partners, we do have
stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for us, it was more just that we had
the skill set to do the building and
[SPEAKER_02]: acquisition of these types of properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dana Robacher is our friend and local
congressman in my state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when that's passing, when we launched
our fund, he was on the Congress floor
[SPEAKER_02]: calling in for a live interview when we
launched the fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of the genesis for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we've been into it and get further
and further into it, we're hearing and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're learning all these stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just as a kind of a metric,
this is about a $50 billion asset class of
[SPEAKER_02]: real estate once it's built out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been about $3 billion put out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of that $3 billion, we've done $435
million of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our facilities are generating probably
at least $2 billion worth of revenue
[SPEAKER_02]: coming through the United States each
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me personally, the fact that that
much cannabis is being legally produced,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of those people that are purchasing
that are not purchasing opioids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, even if it was just 1% people
that buy opiates are now transitioning
[SPEAKER_02]: over and using cannabis instead,
that's a win for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an enormous economic driver out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Nick said, earlier, it's resilient
to recession and economic downturns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even during COVID, we were deemed an
essential business.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of our transactions had any distress
during that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for everything you've done
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now switching into the European markets,
this is a really exciting time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious what kind of due diligence
you're doing as you prepare for a growing
[SPEAKER_03]: European marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to do due diligence from a debt
perspective when you have no rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're here building relationships,
trying to get a lay of the land.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes time to understand these markets
and how they're emerging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the underlying things that you don't
see in the pitch decks and the data sets
[SPEAKER_02]: out there, perceptions and how things will
really shake out sometimes takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, it's just starting to build
those relationships, starting to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: transactions, starting to run those
transactions through our modeling to see,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, this would all work here,
but what would we need to solve for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a debt provider, we need to have
attorneys that are licensed in those
[SPEAKER_02]: states or those countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have relationships with
regulators.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know what do we need to be able
to do in the event that we had to
[SPEAKER_02]: foreclose on that facility and we're going
to be potentially directly in the business
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have to think all those things
all the way through.
[SPEAKER_02]: My job at one point was, I was worst case
scenario Rob, because I always had to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the one that broke the transaction and the
models to see what are we going to do in
[SPEAKER_02]: these worst case scenarios to make sure
that we can unwind that transaction,
[SPEAKER_02]: get it repositioned and it's sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us right now, we're looking for our
third party service providers,
[SPEAKER_02]: which attorneys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earlier at the conference this morning,
there was four attorneys up here and two
[SPEAKER_02]: of them were our attorneys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was pretty funny,
Denton's and Zuber.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need construction consulting companies
to run our feasibility reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have, who are we going to be
using for insurance?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit different nuance in
Europe than the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the United States, these traditional
third party service providers,
[SPEAKER_02]: errors and emissions insurance,
property insurance, it's federally
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is in any policy that you
traditionally get, it says that it's null
[SPEAKER_02]: and void if you break the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you need to make sure that you're
in the United States, that you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: those carve outs that they acknowledge
that as long as it's legal in the state,
[SPEAKER_02]: that the policy will still be enforced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to understand how these things
are going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the biggest question I've been asking
some of the people I've been speaking with
[SPEAKER_02]: already at this conference and the one
previously is, I personally and all of our
[SPEAKER_02]: team really needs to get comfortable with
these facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we only do indoor facilities,
production facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't do any agricultural deals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a farming lender and that's not
what we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll only be doing cultivation,
testing, distribution, dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to understand, we know how
much it costs to build these facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen these facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're putting out 10,
20, 50, 100 million dollars into a
[SPEAKER_02]: facility, that is an enormous capex
expense.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to recover that capex
and be profitable when you can import from
[SPEAKER_02]: countries that have lower capex and op-ex
costs?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, that's the biggest one we're
struggling with right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not that it's unsolvable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need to understand how we get
comfortable with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we can't get comfortable with
it, we certainly aren't going to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to get our investors comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm also really curious as this
market blows up and how that relates to
[SPEAKER_03]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: market on the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: federal timeframe for rescheduling,
what that might do for interstate and
[SPEAKER_03]: international trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're looking at that as a way to
gauge how you're going to enter this
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the United States, for my political
prognosis, prognostication is that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: always a push to get the next bill through
the House.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the Senate you need to get
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to get 60 votes in the Senate means
you're going to need 10 Republicans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's actually 17 Republicans that
are identified as being pro-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're not pro-cannabis when you
throw every single thing that the
[SPEAKER_02]: Democrats want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Democrats are not going to let
their trophy piece of what they run on go
[SPEAKER_02]: through unless they get social justice
reform and social equity components put in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the Republicans and I
think the whole industry is okay with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Democrats' problem is they always
go so far overboard that you can't keep
[SPEAKER_02]: the Republicans on board.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, I don't see any, my
prognostication is it's going to be in the
[SPEAKER_02]: next administration, whether it's
Republican or Democrat at best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that they're not going to see any
meaningful reform in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually, we do see it being
de-conflicted from federal policy or
[SPEAKER_02]: federally legalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if that happens, I don't think
that the United States is going to allow
[SPEAKER_02]: importation if it becomes federally legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, truly, there's betting that
it will be able to be exported.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have one of the most advanced
facilities in the world in southern
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida, or sorry, just in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that facility is being built to GMP
certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that they could potentially out,
you know, ship it internationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to be interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think that there will be some
compacts put together between states that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can cross state lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, I think it's just going to
be the status quo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the further it gets down the line,
like in the United States, where you're at
[SPEAKER_02]: 38 states with separate compliance for
every single state, the harder it is to
[SPEAKER_02]: wind all that back in and make it under
one compliant package.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I don't see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, yeah, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's, you know, a lot to think
about, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking of the importing and
exporting and a lot of international
[SPEAKER_03]: trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll look forward to that in the
meantime.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's probably a lot to be
said about how you're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: investing from other countries that are
going to be doing trade before we get a
[SPEAKER_03]: chance to do that ourselves with Europe
and America.
[SPEAKER_03]: But since we have only just a few minutes
left, I wanted to just first ask you one
[SPEAKER_03]: last question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then open it up to the floor to see if
anybody else has any questions for any new
[SPEAKER_03]: entrepreneurs or investors that are just
getting into the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: What advice would you give them?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a lot of investors and raised a
lot of capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we entered the cannabis space,
I had the mistake of thinking that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we would be able to use those
same investors to, to go down this,
[SPEAKER_02]: this direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that wasn't the case at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the opportunity was passing us by and
we, we were not able to lend for 24,
[SPEAKER_02]: for two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've tried all kinds of different
strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been on the same side as,
as many of these entrepreneurs as this
[SPEAKER_02]: market has emerged.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit easier for us to raise
debt than, than you guys, because we have
[SPEAKER_02]: a secured asset, but there's not the
upside either.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if I could give a super massive
piece of advice is you always hear,
[SPEAKER_02]: try to get, you know, as few investors as
possible and as big a checks as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in reality, nobody, that's a very
difficult proposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I would tell people is don't
go the traditional way of, of,
[SPEAKER_02]: of trying to raise capital, try to have
the lowest entry point or the lowest size
[SPEAKER_02]: check writer in the, in the most amount of
investors, because raising money at five,
[SPEAKER_02]: $25,000 at a time is going to get you
further down the line than waiting for
[SPEAKER_02]: guys at a hundred thousand or 250 or a
million at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need that basis of capital to get
the bigger check writers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just, just when you start thinking
about how you're going to do your raise,
[SPEAKER_02]: think about your, your securities offering
or your structuring or your, how your,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the third parties that you're going
to use to manage your investors in the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States, that might be K ones or
investor portals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just think about using third party
facility, third parties that can
[SPEAKER_02]: facilitate a way higher, the maximum
amount of investors that you possibly can
[SPEAKER_02]: and minimize those, those investment
amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better to have, to have capital
flowing in all the time than keep talking
[SPEAKER_02]: to people and they're, they're thinking
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need those checks flowing in all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we switched to retail investors in
2016 and today we have about a thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: and 80 of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our fund is currently about 303 million
assets in our management.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's compromised, it's, it consists of
probably at least 95%, it might be 98% of
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so an individual is going to be able
to give you a decision within a day or
[SPEAKER_02]: two, cause they're their own credit
committee.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start going to funds,
when you start going to institutional
[SPEAKER_02]: investors, when you start going to these
other people, you lost that, that direct
[SPEAKER_02]: connection to the person making the
decision of being able to pitch your story
[SPEAKER_02]: and answer those questions that they might
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you tell somebody and they go to tell
your story to a credit committee in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, good fricking luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have four years of audited
returns.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're investment grade rated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have institutional investors and still
it's, it's enormously challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a lot easier than most people
are because of the history we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be my, my primary advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and another thing too is that you,
it, it, you should be using data and facts
[SPEAKER_02]: to educate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The investment should sell itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just about giving it, educating them,
letting them know, you know, what,
[SPEAKER_02]: what, what this is going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why, and this is how we're
supporting these facts based on the
[SPEAKER_02]: information we know today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that event information in facts is
going to continue to evolve and change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as long as you're using facts to back
that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did anybody here have any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to open it up if you'd like
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more time for Rob Sequist and Mary
Patton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a, I have a microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a retail investor and as a cannabis
company, how would one connect with
[SPEAKER_00]: Polaris?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can reach out to us through the app,
our website.
[SPEAKER_02]: My email is rob at Polaris Equity Group.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you can see it in the,
in the, the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have an app.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have the Whova app, W-H-O-V-A.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or catch me afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to give you my contact
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speed walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-state operator, I'm thinking about
coming into the European markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you write, underwrite in the
European markets currently?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second part of my question is
going back to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about the opportunity
zones?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that an area of development within
your own business?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one is we are looking at,
preliminarily looking at transactions here
[SPEAKER_02]: in, in Europe, in, in foreign countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we, if we land on a, on a transaction
that, that meets all of our, our metrics
[SPEAKER_02]: that we've established in the U.S.,
and then we can get past answering some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the compliance or the, the underlying
questions that we're not sure of,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're willing to come here to,
to, we're willing to lend.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next part is, is our fund is only
authorized to lend within the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we have to decide, are we going to
do a standalone transactions or launch a
[SPEAKER_02]: fund here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right at this point, there's not enough
business for us to launch a half a billion
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar fund here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, it just doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have dead capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll probably aggregate a few
transactions and then assign those into
[SPEAKER_02]: our funds in the next three to five years,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're here early to get an
understanding and build these
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships today.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it relates back to the United States
and, and opportunity zones, and
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity zones in the, in the United
States is just a, a zone where you have
[SPEAKER_02]: really beneficial tax structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are just a lender, so we don't own
the property.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the owner of the property is the one
that would benefit from the opportunity
[SPEAKER_02]: zone, not us as the lender.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as we do have our own division,
we do own lots of projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a whole separate division of the
company that entitles stuff, entitles
[SPEAKER_02]: projects for cannabis and that builds
relationships with, with the cities so
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can take advantage of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are, and we'll probably launch a
fund in the United States that is not an
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity, opportunity zone focused
fund, but we're, we believe that there'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be some repositioning of distressed
transactions in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the next 12 to 24 months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're positioned to, to reposition
those assets with that, that fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: A great question.
Wow, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys getting hungry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's go eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary Penn and Rob Seacrest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
