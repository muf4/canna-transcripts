[SPEAKER_07]: Come see us in Slovenia in September for
the science and technology forum.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna be a good time Shout out to the
Talman group for being our signature
[SPEAKER_07]: sponsor and away we go Our next panel
genetics and breeding who's for it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay genetics, yay breeding To lead us on
this the senior consultant the co-founder
[SPEAKER_07]: of the Sistanza group the one and only
make some noise put your hands together
[SPEAKER_07]: let's hear it for John Gutierrez And he's
in a hoodie No, you always need someone in
[SPEAKER_07]: a hoodie on the panel we just had a
discussion about this you weren't in the
[SPEAKER_07]: room, but it it's great Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks a lot Yeah, thanks everyone for
coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Thursday afternoon, let's do this
Yeah, so we wanted to just get the
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation Started on genetics,
you know, there's it's one of the main
[SPEAKER_04]: main things that you know growers Think
about talk about you know when starting an
[SPEAKER_04]: operation It's one of the main things that
they need to keep in mind, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, let's we'll jump into that a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But first though, let's do some
introductions and go from there Dave go
[SPEAKER_06]: for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Dave the commissioner for big
league genetics We are a licensed to
[SPEAKER_06]: nursery in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been selling genetics for the last
three years across the country and now I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: super proud to say that we Completed our
first export to Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: We spent 17 genetics over to demican Yeah,
we're pretty excited about it On top of
[SPEAKER_06]: our nursery program.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've also got a 20,000 square foot
cultivation facility where we Run our
[SPEAKER_06]: phenol hunts.
[SPEAKER_06]: We grow our we have to walk our talk We
run a lot of our genetics on a regular
[SPEAKER_06]: basis commercially and we export that
flower to Germany Into Australia happy to
[SPEAKER_06]: be here excited about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'm Matthew Don Corliss and the
VP of sales and business development for
[SPEAKER_05]: Sega International.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a tissue culture Company with
molecular lab services as well So we work
[SPEAKER_05]: with amazing breeders from all over the
world and we bring their plants in vitro
[SPEAKER_05]: Tissue culture them we DNA fingerprint
them so they're true to type and we can
[SPEAKER_05]: monitor the stability of the genetics in
an in vitro state and We ship to I think
[SPEAKER_05]: eight countries right now and we've got
three more countries coming online very
[SPEAKER_03]: soon, so global distributor of cannabis
genetics I Come from the Spanish in the in
[SPEAKER_03]: the West Coast all my career was involved
in the cannabis industry more than 20
[SPEAKER_03]: years Working inside associations trying
to get the cannabis legalization in my
[SPEAKER_03]: country by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations to the German to the
German audience Well spreading the
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge about the cannabis making seeds
micro propagation during Ten years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was working a kind of it sees a
nutrition company from Holland and the
[SPEAKER_03]: last four years I have been working with
the legality see and CBD producers in the
[SPEAKER_03]: European Union We have a nutrients and a
specific cannabis brand of fertilizer
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to give a transversal support To my
customer to get the maximum potential of
[SPEAKER_04]: the cultivars And my name is Juan
Gutierrez, I'm I'm a consultant now been a
[SPEAKER_04]: consultant for four years, but I've been
growing cannabis professionally in Canada
[SPEAKER_04]: for for some time now Started back in 2013
Managed some big facilities out there kept
[SPEAKER_04]: expanding our company was bought out
borrower cannabis And then yeah now we're
[SPEAKER_04]: consulting We're building facilities all
over the world helping growers improve
[SPEAKER_04]: their facilities So yeah, so I'm let's say
a customer from these guys, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I go to companies like Sega I like,
you know big league we're looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics, you know, so for me it's it's
I'm on the client side let's say so I
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess one of the first things that I
wanted to ask you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's what are you seeing right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: That are the most important factors When
growers go out and looking for genetics,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's THC still kind of like that
main thing, you know How does it change
[SPEAKER_06]: now high THC every time all the time like
it's it's an unfortunate reality That's
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of going on the market right now But
yeah, high THC has always been the driving
[SPEAKER_06]: force of genetics and genetic purchasing
questions when you get asked Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: you got something over 30% Yeah,
we got some over 30% But now we're really
[SPEAKER_06]: starting especially more like markets like
Canada More data on the genetics is more
[SPEAKER_06]: important and guys are starting to ask
better questions than just hey What's the
[SPEAKER_06]: THC potency on this now?
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes down to yield bag appeal terpenes
all super important yield per plant how
[SPEAKER_05]: they perform Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can agree more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean high THC is unfortunately still
driving This global market and it really
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the liquor board kind of needed a
quantifiable number to associate some sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of price matrix on but Yeah Like Dave was
saying yield data flower samples
[SPEAKER_05]: everything It's it's the full kit and
caboodle multiple commercial run the
[SPEAKER_05]: stability of the genetics and also
mitigating any sort of economic risk I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean plant tissue culture is the way to do
that because if you're starting with clean
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics You know your plants aren't you
know infected with any sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: intercellular bacteria contamination
Fusarium pythium you name it as kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: your mother plants grow on and so keeping
those fresh is important Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: totally agree with my colleagues I think
the same that he sees the most demanded
[SPEAKER_03]: Requirement in a strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the the demand of the of the of
the market is changing for the terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: profile But right now that this is the
most Demanded thing knowing the in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, unfortunately, but you know,
we do a lot of work in Thailand,
[SPEAKER_04]: for example We've been building quite a
few facilities out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been traveling to Thailand in the
past year and a half I've been there quite
[SPEAKER_04]: a bit and and I see now there that the
focus is not so much THC anymore But let's
[SPEAKER_04]: say terpene profiles and you know,
how does the flower look?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the effect?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know it you go to dispensaries
out there and it's like, okay What kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: vibe are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_04]: For example as opposed to you know,
how high do you want to get whatever now?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll help you choose something
to to go with that for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think little by little as you know,
there's more markets open up I think
[SPEAKER_04]: there's going to be kind of you know
changes in that and hopefully I mean you
[SPEAKER_04]: can see it also in the West Coast in the
US to the THC is kind of like starting to
[SPEAKER_04]: be less and less important but Terpene
profile terpene percent for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that's I think and as a grower
for example You know, I'm not looking only
[SPEAKER_04]: at the the final product But also,
you know yield for example looking at if
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm growing a greenhouse For example,
okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, how is how does it behave,
you know in a certain cultivation system
[SPEAKER_04]: or from growing outdoors?
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, is it is a let's say for
example, you know adapted to certain
[SPEAKER_04]: environments things like that So of
course, there's many different things I
[SPEAKER_05]: guess but yeah, I mean ultimately it's
quite a shame and I'm sure Dave would
[SPEAKER_05]: agree with me but you know this race to
breed towards high THC is you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're losing and diluting a lot of the
amazing traits and characteristics of and
[SPEAKER_05]: morphologies of these plants and You know,
I've smoked Cannabis that is 16% that is a
[SPEAKER_05]: heck of a lot stronger on the efficacy
wise than than anything that's 30 plus and
[SPEAKER_05]: really people need to Kind of go away from
this high THC Matrix and and really look
[SPEAKER_05]: at the the full effect because the reality
is is that everybody's endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: system processes and metabolizes cannabis
differently and You know 16% to one person
[SPEAKER_05]: and 30% to the other, you know could have
the same balancing effects For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, so Jose in Europe, you know You
said you were working here for quite some
[SPEAKER_04]: time, you know in the seed game things
like that So what do you think here in
[SPEAKER_04]: Europe specifically?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do people look for in terms of the
right genetic for example and for a
[SPEAKER_04]: grower?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it important to have this kind of
information from the beginning?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say about select the right genetic
from the start.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are several reasons starting with We
need sell a product with some
[SPEAKER_03]: characteristic that the customer is
looking for and the And the or our target
[SPEAKER_03]: in the market is no I always say that is a
key factor the genetics more than other
[SPEAKER_03]: parameters in a big percentage we can make
for example a right irrigation strategy or
[SPEAKER_03]: We can give the right nutrition with a
button for example But we won't reach 30%
[SPEAKER_03]: THC with a genetic of 50% THC So yeah make
a good choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's crucial for forget the
sources in this business About the most
[SPEAKER_03]: demanded strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will speak first about the black market
because already seats in Spain For
[SPEAKER_03]: example, there is a demand of top quality
without top quality requirements
[SPEAKER_03]: non-established seats In bulk in a lot of
cases with a very low price What are the
[SPEAKER_03]: more demanded the obvious?
[SPEAKER_03]: No fast flowering easy to grow without
deal flavors and a state in this kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: market usually aren't needed because the
price per gram will be the same sadly in
[SPEAKER_03]: Is very common that the the use of
synthetic PGRs to increase the deal,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they are looking the the Good quality
knowing the flower about some growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a change in the demand right now
They are looking for the hype of new
[SPEAKER_03]: strains have winners high THC content a
specific terpene or a strain good for
[SPEAKER_03]: extractions also the auto flowering a
strain I think is a piece of the market
[SPEAKER_03]: know because several resources not for
example The the quality is better than a
[SPEAKER_03]: few years ago and also for example They
can make different harvest during the
[SPEAKER_03]: season during the summer and has fresh
product in the in the summer No,
[SPEAKER_03]: on the other hand about the legal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are demanding a faster transition to
a more professionalized sector They need
[SPEAKER_03]: like my colleague said before know as a
fundamental requirement a clear
[SPEAKER_03]: identification quality protocols and
talking about characteristics in the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics the bigger offer in the market I
think is between 15 to 25 but of course TC
[SPEAKER_03]: is the most demanded if you have 30 is
better than 25 not right now Something
[SPEAKER_03]: that I see in each country I travel know
for example I think that the market goes
[SPEAKER_03]: in the good direction looking for a better
terpene profile like you know for medical
[SPEAKER_03]: proposed the TC is not the more important
thing in our strain and the same in
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational know in Malta Island for
example the the main goal for producers is
[SPEAKER_03]: get the Maximum TC because it's the most
demanded with in the club know But there
[SPEAKER_03]: is also demanding a strange with a lower
amount of TC with the less psychoactive
[SPEAKER_03]: efforts ratios one one or with other
compounds like happen with panache and TCB
[SPEAKER_03]: or CBG I think well, so it's other other
important piece of the market know
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely I can agree more with the
you know drive towards balanced genetics
[SPEAKER_05]: or rare cannabinoids, you know,
we've been onboarding a number of kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: unique genetics for for API's and
applications like that high case you begin
[SPEAKER_05]: a THC be genetic CBG CBN But there's a
market for that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah right on cool So we talked about what
you know, let's say what growers want or
[SPEAKER_04]: the consumer wants but you know from our
from our cultivation perspective Let's say
[SPEAKER_04]: what some of the some of the things that
you want to avoid, you know, there's many
[SPEAKER_04]: ways to get genetics, you know,
you can trade Clones with somebody seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: you your own phenol hunts things like that
But you know, what are some of the main
[SPEAKER_04]: issues mad that you're seeing that you're
trying to avoid with bringing in genetics
[SPEAKER_05]: to facilities I mean what we're seeing
right now, I mean and this is something
[SPEAKER_05]: that's Probably everybody knows about but
hoplite and viro it is vector through seed
[SPEAKER_05]: and so a lot of the seed Packs that people
are hunting through You know, they're
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing in risk into their into their
business and so we're trying to de-risk
[SPEAKER_05]: that business by working with good phenol
hunters and breeders and supporting their
[SPEAKER_05]: outfits and their work with With with
clean plants that are stable You know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just too big of a risk We've had a
number of customers in Canada that you
[SPEAKER_05]: know decided to go down the rabbit hole of
doing a phenol hunt and you know nine
[SPEAKER_05]: months later They call us back on our
entire facilities in fact with hoplite and
[SPEAKER_05]: viro it's like, okay Well, we kind of told
you that but you know so our job is to
[SPEAKER_05]: work with amazing breeders and phenol
hunters bring in the genetics there so
[SPEAKER_05]: they don't have to because You know the
amount of seed out there that that's full
[SPEAKER_05]: of contamination is vast and you know,
we're actually working with a lot of the
[SPEAKER_05]: breeders now like JB at Sea Junkie tissue
culturing his breeding stock as well as
[SPEAKER_05]: Atlas seed and So making sure those inbred
breeding lines and those those crosses are
[SPEAKER_05]: from TC so that you know, we can ensure
that You know the breeding moving into the
[SPEAKER_05]: future is is on the clean side of things
instead of Kind of a haphazard mismatch
[SPEAKER_05]: that's been going on for the last 25 years
So some people out there may not know what
[SPEAKER_04]: the hoplite and viro it is so can you give
a little bit of a you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean it's a viroid Yeah, yeah it It's
very catchy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can transfer with tools and scissors and
essentially it infects a plant and Duds it
[SPEAKER_05]: out basically so, you know, you can see a
drastic decrease in your plants
[SPEAKER_05]: performance overnight and All of a sudden
your 30 percenter is now 10% and the
[SPEAKER_05]: flowers basically unusable It's a serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a serious issue It's still
widespread.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is everywhere and you know,
if you're not testing on a regular basis
[SPEAKER_05]: You know with quality testing labs,
you know ones that actually Will validate
[SPEAKER_05]: their positive or negative HLV tests?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're kind of fishing the dark
it's it's it's gonna be out there for a
[SPEAKER_05]: long while and the work that You know,
we're doing is to help eradicate that and
[SPEAKER_05]: educate people and then just support You
know amazing breeders and phenohunters
[SPEAKER_05]: like like Dave here Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you got to be careful anytime you're
doing a phenohunt anytime you're working
[SPEAKER_06]: with new plants You really want to be
careful to make sure that you are checking
[SPEAKER_06]: rechecking checking again Hoplite and
viroid the only thing I disagree with with
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt said was that it can kind of happen
overnight You're actually gonna go eight
[SPEAKER_06]: weeks and you're gonna get to the end and
then you're gonna know that you've got it
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's gonna be a sad day in your room,
so yeah, it's it's it's something you
[SPEAKER_06]: really got to be careful for and Always be
careful when you're taking in new genetics
[SPEAKER_06]: and making sure that you're getting them
from a clean source Absolutely,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we see a lot of it, you know places
like for example Thailand for example
[SPEAKER_04]: Where you know a lot of genetics are
coming in and a lot of people they are
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe not so Experienced seeing the kind
of symptoms for example And you know more
[SPEAKER_04]: and more facilities that we're able to
visit and it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: have you heard of hoplite?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, oh no.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's only in North America things
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like no, it's it's It's in your grow,
you know, it's I'm seeing it right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So test it, you know And that's so
perplexing to me why new countries coming
[SPEAKER_05]: online like Australia and New Zealand and
Even Germany with the the rack market,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, they're they're mandated is to
import seed and this it's it's it's really
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, kind of kneecapping yourself
because you're you're importing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: potential problems You know, it's it's
yeah, it's it's a heck of a lot of work
[SPEAKER_05]: because if you know hunting as Dave knows
is a very long process and You may not
[SPEAKER_05]: find any winners.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, so it's it's a random
number generator essentially to Find a
[SPEAKER_05]: winner.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we keep saying this fino hunting
or maybe some people don't know what it
[SPEAKER_04]: actually is Maybe Dave, you know
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we pop seeds and we you know,
a fino hunt is a hunt that we you know
[SPEAKER_06]: conduct in our rooms we'll take a room out
and We'll prop our rooms will hold about
[SPEAKER_06]: 300 plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's a that's a comfortable
number number to fino hunting We'll run
[SPEAKER_06]: out a genetic that we've never seen before
we pop a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: We take clones of all of those and Take
those through flower Some don't make it
[SPEAKER_06]: some are males like depending if you're if
you're hunting regs or if you're regular
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds or Feminized seeds you're gonna deal
with some males.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna deal with some weirdness
Sometimes you'll have intersex properties
[SPEAKER_06]: that will show up and so those immediately
get turfed Anything kind of small and run
[SPEAKER_06]: T is you know, you get that out of there
and then you end up with your your final
[SPEAKER_06]: population We'll flower that out first
time and get just our you know initial
[SPEAKER_06]: thoughts Okay, what do we like?
[SPEAKER_06]: What don't like before we see any any lab
results if we like the way it grew the way
[SPEAKER_06]: that the structure was The yield looked
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flower looked good.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take it for another run We'll run a
smaller population of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do like, you know, maybe 12 or 15
plants run those out Take a look at those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, do we still like it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this commercially viable and then we'll
start to ramp up the size and of the ones
[SPEAKER_06]: that we call our winners And then you know
lab results are obviously got then into
[SPEAKER_06]: factor.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the terpenes?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like is this unique?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a lot like, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Tangy has been like such a prominent
terpene that you know You get a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: that and so it's just like is this filling
a hole?
[SPEAKER_06]: In some do we have something that we like
this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it better than what we've already got
and then if those answers are yes,
[SPEAKER_06]: then you know, we'll move on to
commercialize a genetic Just a question
[SPEAKER_05]: for you Dave.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolute true winners have you had?
[SPEAKER_05]: That you've had to toss aside because of
this high THC matrix papaya punch rest in
[SPEAKER_06]: peace Yeah, unfortunately Papaya punch was
what it was on the back of my business
[SPEAKER_06]: card for like a year and a half It was a
fantastic plant was a beautiful plant
[SPEAKER_06]: makes phenomenal hash rods and just really
good but this as far as like Does anybody
[SPEAKER_06]: want a 19 percenter?
[SPEAKER_06]: It smells great But yeah, it's yeah,
we unfortunately yes, I'm don't make the
[SPEAKER_06]: cut it's unruly beast When you're dealing
with a lot of plants, fortunately our
[SPEAKER_06]: facilities have now kind of gotten a
little bit bigger We used to be pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: small and doing phenohunts was a lot
tougher, but we're you know as the company
[SPEAKER_06]: grows It's getting a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, but that is a real factor Yeah,
right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we'll just do one last quick
question before we open it up to to For
[SPEAKER_04]: questions from from the audience say and
yeah, just quickly here, you know You guys
[SPEAKER_04]: both let's say big league and sagra
provide genetics, you know all over the
[SPEAKER_04]: world you do phenohunting But where does
actually genetics come from?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like what kind of partnerships
you guys are are working with in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: breeders and things like that So yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean our model is such that you know,
we we know the breeders are out there They
[SPEAKER_05]: love doing the work and we love working
with them and helping them monetize their
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics So we get their platinum breeder
selection cuts and we bring them into in
[SPEAKER_05]: vitro And we multiply them and we create
identical twins and so we can stabilize
[SPEAKER_05]: those in in vitro state So we work with
sea junkie compound Parker Sullivan
[SPEAKER_05]: Grounded genetics the holding company a
number of different breeders and we've got
[SPEAKER_05]: some new partners coming online flavor
house With drip genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got some amazing new cuts coming
out And some other future ones may be
[SPEAKER_05]: coming soon, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we'll open it up to four
questions from the audience
[SPEAKER_07]: First and then we'll get over to you and
then also we'll go this way We'll do the
[SPEAKER_07]: triangle and if you're in the back and you
have a question Just walk up to one of the
[SPEAKER_07]: microphones and we'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not climbing up all these damn stairs
again Hey guys awesome panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know most of you but I wanted to ask
this question first Of all, I love 19%
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like flavor over potency any day and it
sucks Just a quick question that I want
[SPEAKER_08]: you guys to touch on and I'll pass it off
The tissue culture is so important and no
[SPEAKER_08]: one's really talking about that Can you
talk about why people aren't talking more
[SPEAKER_08]: about tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it can AI or technology be
utilized in making cool genetics in the
[SPEAKER_08]: future.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all Yeah, so I mean tissue culture
on a big ag scale everybody derives all of
[SPEAKER_05]: their feedstock for strawberries and
Tomatoes and all that kind of stuff from
[SPEAKER_05]: tissue culture and so it's starting to
evolve in a cannabis space is becoming
[SPEAKER_05]: more relevant just because of the economic
risk of not having it So, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can't keep keep intercellular bacteria
contamination or fusarium out of your
[SPEAKER_05]: mother stock plants You know, we you know
refresh them every three months To to
[SPEAKER_05]: ensure that the plants that you're putting
into your system or control When you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: have plant tissue culture with with the
skill set that are Our team has with DNA
[SPEAKER_05]: fingerprinting and the full pathogen panel
assays and testing that we do You know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it is an economic risk that that is a
variable and so, you know in this industry
[SPEAKER_05]: having one crop failure You know is
challenging if you have three in a row
[SPEAKER_05]: because you didn't realize that your
plants were infected That could be the
[SPEAKER_05]: silver bullet for your business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so really it's it's it's it's
insulating your economic bottom line and
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know the economic cost versus the
economic risk is not Even an equation you
[SPEAKER_05]: want to do the math on but yeah,
yeah Lately we've been recommending a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: more to our clients, you know Not only to
have their mother stock for example But
[SPEAKER_04]: you know the backup mothers for example,
right and before that and have some kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of tissue culture bank Let's say either
within their facility or work with a
[SPEAKER_04]: company or a service that will provide
that You know kind of you know ability to
[SPEAKER_04]: keep genetics in tissue culture and vitro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I mean a lot of the a lot of the kind
of information we're passing to our
[SPEAKER_05]: customers that have had some Struggles is
really just omitting the mother room
[SPEAKER_05]: altogether and just getting full provision
plants directly from us They can turn that
[SPEAKER_05]: mother room into a profit center and sort
of an economic dumpster fire and you know
[SPEAKER_05]: be able to Maintain homogeneity amongst
there, you know kind of bottom line No,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll continue on that because he had
brought he had asked about the AI and
[SPEAKER_06]: we're actually doing a little bit of that
Yeah, we we've actually just implemented a
[SPEAKER_06]: new a new system in our in our growth
That's that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a it's a camera with a an AI system
kind of backed into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also got sensors It's doing leaf
temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's doing bud sites per square foot And
so it's analyzing the room every single
[SPEAKER_06]: day all day long.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we get a report that's written It's
half AI half dealing with plant scientists
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's actually taking a look at the
room every square foot of the room And so
[SPEAKER_06]: we're actually getting to see you know is
this does it look like it's yielding more
[SPEAKER_06]: or am I a week three and I can see that?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is already starting to show signs of
something awesome or you know the
[SPEAKER_06]: otherwise so yeah AI is definitely
starting to help definitely and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: also an opportunity also for genetics work
as well and looking at you know DNA and
[SPEAKER_04]: and what are the markers for an actual
good genetic?
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, right and how do we analyze
that, you know from an AI perspective that
[SPEAKER_04]: that's also something very interesting
Yeah, I mean we're doing some research.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean we're a biotech company by kind of
origin and a lot of the work that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing and what we're wanting to do with
our future is marker assisted breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So breeding for traits we're doing some
trials right now with Drs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amirapoonja, which we work with often on
on plants that are asymptomatic
[SPEAKER_05]: asymptomatic to hoplite and viroid,
pheasarium some of the other pathogens and
[SPEAKER_05]: viruses that we test for and really
looking at those markers just on a
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding perspective where we can you know
create the genetics of the future with
[SPEAKER_05]: purpose and really know what those traits
are.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know we're doing that as a side
project we don't do that with any of our
[SPEAKER_05]: clients genetics without their approvals
but you know really into the future yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not a finalist program but you know
moving into the future doing those
[SPEAKER_05]: specific breeding projects are gonna just
you know kind of get us out of this
[SPEAKER_05]: 20-year haphazard breeding program that's
been going on in the black market for a
[SPEAKER_05]: little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned early on that you can
identify many different characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: from the genetics in terms of the
performance of the plant so for example
[SPEAKER_00]: and how vociferously it grows how
resistant it is maybe for to temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and how much how much light it can absorb
and still perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any data available on those other
characteristics yet in terms of you know
[SPEAKER_00]: relating those characteristics to specific
genetics?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah we're starting to do that a bunch we
have like we we have a nursery which is
[SPEAKER_06]: off-site it's about a 4,000 square foot
facility and then we have our grow space
[SPEAKER_06]: which is a 20,000 square foot facility so
we're constantly working with our growers
[SPEAKER_06]: they're all you know under the big league
team and you know they're constantly
[SPEAKER_06]: giving us data back on what they do.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also work with different partners and
different groups we're doing some outdoor
[SPEAKER_06]: trials this year up in Canada we're doing
we work in greenhouses all the time in
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada but as more legalization throughout
the world opens up we're gonna get more
[SPEAKER_06]: and more of that data going forward to get
to say okay how does it do in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_06]: in this area and how does it do in a
greenhouse in this area.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that we find with genetics is
that just because it's working out in my
[SPEAKER_06]: facility I've got double-ended high
pressure sodium lights I'm growing in
[SPEAKER_06]: cocoa you might grow in rock wool under
LEDs we're gonna have different results
[SPEAKER_06]: and so as we continue to get our genetics
out there and work with growers we get
[SPEAKER_06]: more of that data back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I mean and one of our main breeder
partners JB at Sea Junkie you know when he
[SPEAKER_05]: does his phenohunting process one of the
matrix that he uses to select his winners
[SPEAKER_05]: is the room dynamics of EPDs the light
intensities and all that kind of stuff and
[SPEAKER_05]: so he's really you know looking for
winners that fit that mold so you know
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of the shortcut of the story is that
you know I can grow 17 of his varieties in
[SPEAKER_05]: one room and they should all perform under
the same room conditions.
Right here and then right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey guys how's it going?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey buddy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey Chris.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey don't worry guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about this a little bit the
other day but I think that there's a
[SPEAKER_09]: especially in Europe there's a couple
genetic favorites like super silver haze
[SPEAKER_09]: amnesia haze you know that become kind of
household names and a couple repeaters we
[SPEAKER_09]: see that in you know blue dream and stuff
like that in the United States as well do
[SPEAKER_09]: you think there's a shift going on with
fewer more well-known cultivars or do you
[SPEAKER_09]: think in Europe especially there's going
to be the same effect as the United States
[SPEAKER_09]: is that we need new like a lot of new
flavors all the time what do you guys
[SPEAKER_09]: think about product diversity in that
sense?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to continue I think
it's gonna be a lot of new new flavors all
[SPEAKER_06]: the time I think that there's definitely
going to be you know the tried-and-true is
[SPEAKER_06]: your you know your blue dreams and your
amnesia hazes and you know there'll be you
[SPEAKER_06]: know a good tangy and things like that but
I think that everybody at least I don't
[SPEAKER_06]: know my cannabis collection is you know
pretty assorted like I've got you know 20
[SPEAKER_06]: or 30 different things that were jars that
we're checking out it all the time I don't
[SPEAKER_06]: think anybody really wants like just a you
know one thing it's always nice when you
[SPEAKER_06]: can find a strain that you can smoke every
day but you know you still like to go
[SPEAKER_07]: exploring and you know all the growers
want to be the next cookies so everybody's
[SPEAKER_07]: always trying to know mine is the best one
and this one's the best one anyway over
[SPEAKER_07]: here we have time for like two two two
more so three maybe three go hello hello
[SPEAKER_02]: my name is Pavel I'm from Czech Republic
and we work hard for for legalization and
[SPEAKER_02]: our goal is now 1% THC in Czech Republic
and it will be changed but my question is
[SPEAKER_02]: simple when I will specialize it on clones
how important is the genetics for starting
[SPEAKER_02]: just cloning are just regular seeds or
what I need to do that I after one year I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't need change the matter matter plants
yeah yeah I mean if you're if you're after
[SPEAKER_05]: a fresh start I mean the reality is you
want to start with something that's that's
[SPEAKER_05]: tried tested and true through our culture
process we create identical twins so
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially the plants performance will be
the same year one and you're 10 you know
[SPEAKER_05]: with our DNA fingerprinting mapping that
morphology and you know you don't want to
[SPEAKER_05]: bring a variable into your brand-new
project that you've just spent millions of
[SPEAKER_05]: dollars building and you know with our
support I mean I've got 26 years of
[SPEAKER_05]: experience Matt rogue aerograms has 26
years of experience so when you buy plants
[SPEAKER_05]: from us you don't just buy plants you get
our entire support structure you know to
[SPEAKER_05]: assist in the growth and development of
your business and I've you know I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: doing this for a very long time and making
the weed world go around as well you know
[SPEAKER_05]: same with Dave and you know we help our
customers out there I see them and many of
[SPEAKER_05]: our customers out in the audience right
now and you know without their success
[SPEAKER_05]: we're not successful so you know we you
know when you buy plants from us you're
[SPEAKER_05]: not just buying plants from us you're
buying our millions of dollars worth of
[SPEAKER_05]: mistakes that we've made over the last you
know two decades yeah yeah Jose I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: question for Jose in I was recently in the
Spanish market and in the clubs there
[SPEAKER_01]: there was bottom shelf Spanish origin
middle shelf better Spanish origin and
[SPEAKER_01]: then top shelf was California and so my
question is is there really that much
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between the bottom shelf
capabilities in Spain versus the top shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: in California and then for the broader
panel is there a narrowing of the gap
[SPEAKER_01]: between the skill sets of the really
really good breeders and good cultivators
[SPEAKER_01]: is it starting to eat even out
internationally or is there still pockets
[SPEAKER_01]: of really good growers in one area and
lesser you know skilled growers and others
[SPEAKER_03]: thank you just about the first question I
think the u.s.
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics usually has a by the by the
region no more TC than the original
[SPEAKER_03]: restraints that we have in Europe in the
last years but I think is more the way of
[SPEAKER_03]: work no my college here I think are making
a very good job and in Europe I think some
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds companies must change the weight of
do the things no because there are there
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't an homogeneous strain there are I
saw a lot of things during this 20 25
[SPEAKER_03]: years for example sell one one a strain
and they are selling other a strain that
[SPEAKER_03]: the name you know this in fact must change
in my opinion so well in the in the class
[SPEAKER_03]: for example they are looking always for
the high TC strains also for new flavors
[SPEAKER_03]: so I think for that for that reason is
this difference no between the the Spanish
[SPEAKER_03]: or the European seeds and the and they use
and they use it and I think sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_07]: like almost like a grape vintage you know
I mean like exactly this was a good year
[SPEAKER_07]: for blue dream this was this this batch
just happened to come out really well and
[SPEAKER_07]: this batch wasn't great it happens all the
time in California in wine like 2017 or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever sure I mean it's such a personal
experience as well right I mean everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: has their own flavor their own brand for
me our blueberry is is was designed for me
[SPEAKER_05]: for me you know and everybody has their
own you know drink that they like to drink
[SPEAKER_05]: and then cigarettes and so I think you
know the time you know we're in our
[SPEAKER_05]: infancy stages of this you know kind of
evolution of of cannabis consumption and
[SPEAKER_05]: you know you may see you know Spanish
bottom shelf is is a lower quality but you
[SPEAKER_05]: know that might be my favorite you know
favorite brand and then and that shelf
[SPEAKER_06]: continues to go up like as as better
access to better genetics like Canada when
[SPEAKER_06]: it first started like I think Aurora
started like 250 seeds and so that's not a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of selection to get to pick from and
so like as more genetics become available
[SPEAKER_06]: as more information becomes available as
people get better at this you got more
[SPEAKER_06]: experts out there that have done this
before like we used to grow in attics and
[SPEAKER_06]: basements and now we get to grow in
stadiums and warehouses it's you know
[SPEAKER_04]: which are just giant attics and basements
yeah sure what else we see too is that you
[SPEAKER_04]: know the better the better genetics let's
say are coming from California but not
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily because let's say that's where
the best growers are but also there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: concentration of growers there breeders
you know there's a lot of and also the
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer has a let's say a higher kind of
you know a higher bar higher standard
[SPEAKER_04]: let's say for example but now you see
places like all over the world like in
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada for example and now we're seeing in
Thailand that yeah California genetics are
[SPEAKER_04]: coming that's what people want based on
the name but at the same time the
[SPEAKER_04]: preference and going back to what we're
talking about before the preference
[SPEAKER_04]: changes right like we see in Thailand for
example they don't like the gassy stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: they don't like the fuel you know they
like like more fruity more kind of like
[SPEAKER_04]: let's say the quintessential sativa kind
of effect things like that so you know it
[SPEAKER_07]: all changes so I hate to cut you off when
we're like five minutes over time this was
[SPEAKER_07]: a really short panel was only designed for
30 minutes for that I apologize I didn't
[SPEAKER_07]: put the schedule together but we have to
move on but I'm sure you could talk to
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody outside thank you all very much
it's here again for the panel
[SPEAKER_07]: get your pictures in this is the
