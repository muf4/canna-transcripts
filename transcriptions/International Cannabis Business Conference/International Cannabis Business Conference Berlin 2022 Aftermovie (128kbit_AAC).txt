[SPEAKER_02]: I love the fact that Germany is
legalizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly hope that Burkhardt, the drug
commissioner, and the rest of the German
[SPEAKER_02]: government have learned from the mistakes
that Canada's government has made.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that the farmers, the mom and pop,
the small shops are all included in
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope everybody has a chance to enter,
whether it's a $50,000 entry or a $20
[SPEAKER_02]: million entry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that there is an aspect that
everyone can be involved because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: ICBC this year was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these people descended from all
over the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: to come and witness what is the explosion
of the cannabis industry across Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany announced it's going wreck and we
saw people coming from Australia,
[SPEAKER_00]: New Zealand, Thailand, all over Europe,
the United States, Canada, Uruguay,
[SPEAKER_00]: South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an amazing evolution and it's a
privilege to be part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big spot in this particular
conference for women's leadership and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just a privilege to be part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, absolutely the best out of the last
five events that have happened here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw almost 2,000 different attendees
that were on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw more countries presented at one
event than I had at all of these different
[SPEAKER_01]: conferences internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to talk to people from Slovenia,
Romania, Ukraine, Colombia, Peru,
[SPEAKER_01]: Asia, United States, it really brought a
lot of people together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They shared tons of that wisdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening good in their markets?
[SPEAKER_01]: What could happen here for Germany and for
Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely the best international
conference I've ever been able to attend
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with Germany being on the verge of
adult use legalization, it's the first and
[SPEAKER_01]: largest GDP nation in Europe, Berlin's
really going to act as the hub for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So great safe city, beautiful
surroundings, museum island, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: things to do, but it's best to be in the
hub of Europe to where this is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ICBC is really well positioned to
be the dominant conference force for the
[SPEAKER_01]: future here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I like the after parties at ICBC?
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex always seems to have amazing guests
from DJ Mugs, Henry Rollins.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've really truly had some amazing after
parties in Berlin and they set the
[SPEAKER_02]: standard for cannabis events and I'm very,
very grateful for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you love ICBC you've got to say and
if you love my god Henry, did you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: say?
Yes, I did.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
