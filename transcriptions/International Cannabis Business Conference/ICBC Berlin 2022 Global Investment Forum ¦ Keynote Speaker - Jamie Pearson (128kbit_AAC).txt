[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm Jamie Pearson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the CEO of Bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bang's 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were born in a warehouse in Oakland 12
years ago when cannabis was really,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was still medical in California at that
time and the industry was just coming into
[SPEAKER_00]: its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about 2012 where cannabis was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 10 years later, almost 13, it'll be 13
years next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've been around a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're in seven US states.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the number one, number two,
and number six chocolate in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first year of cannabis 2.0 in
Canada, we were the number one skew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We outsold any skew of flower,
of pre-roll in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done very, very well across the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have CBD that's in Europe and we've
been in Europe for about five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to skip the two COVID years
because that doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all skip the two COVID years,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Alex asked me to do was talk to
you guys about how cannabis is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: impact the recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to take a little bit of a
show of hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you are German in this room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how many Americans do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I see, I met a bunch of people
yesterday from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just regularly I met a bunch of
regular European non-Germans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I covered, what did I miss?
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the country that started the whole
movement going legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So truly an international group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that many people here yet,
but we are expecting a couple hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm talking about today is how
cannabis is going to impact or could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially impact the recession that I
think, raise your hand if you think we're
[SPEAKER_00]: in a recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think Europe and America are
pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Americans are saying yes,
the Europeans not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is South America doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just turbulent times in the
economies because we're all responding to
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened with COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, are we in a recession?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's going to argue that the economic
times are certain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're all in agreement that we're
in uncertain times right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think cannabis can play an important
role.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better silence my phone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In writing the ship, but the key here is
going to be that legislators are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need to get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what we can all agree on,
especially in the US, is legislators have
[SPEAKER_00]: not done a good job of getting it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think a lot of the legislation
comes in America based in fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm really hoping is that in
other places where cannabis is coming into
[SPEAKER_00]: its own, and I got to give big kudos to
Thailand, you guys have done some making
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis legal and then giving plants to
people, groundbreaking stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really kind of grabbing the
industry and saying we're going to embrace
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can do that in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Germans personally,
I have a special affinity for Deutschland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my kids are here, they're both German
citizens, they both have German passports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've lived in Germany myself,
and I've seen how it works when laws are
[SPEAKER_00]: in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people follow the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that in Germany we can
actually do a great job of making
[SPEAKER_00]: everything good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can learn from what America has
done wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go back into English.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we can learn in Germany,
and you guys are getting ready to go
[SPEAKER_00]: wreck, you're going to go adult use here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn from the mistakes that we
made in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you get your legislation
right, you could actually impact the
[SPEAKER_00]: recession and give yourself a new bucket
of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically the definition of a
recession is if you have two quarters of
[SPEAKER_00]: negative economic growth, so your GDP goes
backwards for two consecutive quarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the technical definition of a
recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the US we're about, any day they're
going to announce quarter two results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that they're going to show
that it went backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that quarter one went
backwards and quarter two went backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will technically be in a recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who are charged with naming the
recession are called the NBER.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the National Bureau of Economic
Research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an eight member panel,
non-partisan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the ones that say whether or not
it's been a recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like for the first time in history,
that eight member panel is going to say
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not in a recession despite the fact
that we've gone backwards two quarters in
[SPEAKER_00]: a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've never seen that, it's
unprecedented.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason that is probably going to
happen is because we have the lowest
[SPEAKER_00]: unemployment in about 70 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hovering right around 3.4% in the US
of unemployment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got this strong job situation,
but the economy's moving backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you couple that with inflation
that we haven't seen the likes of in about
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't really seen anything like
this economically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't just go back and learn from
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do is take you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about what's happened
historically.
[SPEAKER_00]: historically in recessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to talk about how
cannabis can play a role in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like you to raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you are cannabis
entrepreneurs?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you are investors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so there's only a few investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've geared this talk to investors,
but I think what I'll do is just on the
[SPEAKER_00]: fly shift over to the entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so are we in a recession?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, likely, but regardless,
we can use cannabis to get ourselves out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here in Germany, the economy is
also arguably in a recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the research that I did, several
prominent economists said, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're probably in a recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless, we're all recovering from the
pandemic's impact on all of our economies,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also have interesting things going
on like the climate crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have an alarming increase in
nationalistic politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the Brexit, and we've got the
Trumpers, and we've got all this weird
[SPEAKER_00]: politics going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apologize if you're a Trumper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, what we basically have
is a financial crisis sitting over a
[SPEAKER_00]: Bunsen burner, because we've got all this
other stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this moment in time, on top of all
of that, we have the war in Ukraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is arguably also impacting the
supply chain, not just the pandemic,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now the war in Ukraine is affecting
wheat, and it's affecting gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the biggest thing that people
are talking about is Russian oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: Russian natural gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a big fear that Russia's gonna
shut off the natural gas supply to
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that happens, the German economy is
gonna be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the one thing that everybody
agrees upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not trying to scare all of you,
but what I do wanna do is kind of give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a backdrop of where the economic times are
and how cannabis could potentially figure
[SPEAKER_00]: into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what you basically have is massive
inflation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, inflation always impacts consumers
and consumer goods, because people stop
[SPEAKER_00]: spending money when things get expensive,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this massive inflation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our economy's shrinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a war going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a climate crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things are uncertain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're sitting here saying,
how do we as an industry impact all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that in a positive way?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so investors have a right to be
worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here's the last thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bang is a public company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I watch the markets pretty closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are what's considered a trough bear
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So raise your hand if you know what a
trough bear market is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so a bear market's when you've got a
20% shrinkage of price across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter if it's what sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's across all sectors,
you've gone from bull to bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: A trough bear is when it's more than 35%
and it's more than two quarters in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been more than 35% across all
sectors for many, many, many quarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's unprecedented what's happening in
the capital markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically means liquidity has dried up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can all agree it's really hard to
get money.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in cannabis, it's hard to get
money anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in cannabis trying to get
money and you're trying to get money in a
[SPEAKER_00]: trough bear market and then you have all
of that backdrop that I just laid out for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, the question is, how do cannabis
entrepreneurs build an industry in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of all of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the things is we have
to talk to our legislators about what's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is if you're an investor
and you're liquid, this is where fortunes
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna be made because there is a lot
of opportunity out in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy pretty much across the sector
35% back of normal pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So liquid people are gonna go get richer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the really good news for cannabis
investors, and this is where the
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs need to perk up,
is that our entire industry is not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: function across normal market sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna function like alcohol and
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And alcohol and tobacco in tough economic
times actually have an increase in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense, we're all depressed,
we wanna get drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the difference is now we're in this
massive inflationary environment and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't afford top shelf liquor,
so what do consumers do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They go get the cheaper alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where the rub is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in cannabis, what's the cheaper
alternative to legal cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually is going to serve,
if legislators don't get this right,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna blow up the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people are crunched, they're not
gonna stop buying cannabis, they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: buy more cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they wanna buy more cannabis,
they've gotta buy it at cheaper prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your legislators overtax it,
if they overtest it, if they do all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things that we've seen in
California, I'll give an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bang was born in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, they test the plant before
it goes to be blasted into oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they test the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need another test when it goes to
the distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when it goes from the distributor to
the manufacturer, you need another test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you get it from the
manufacturer and you put it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: product, you need another test before it
goes to the retail market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same cannabis is tested four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of those tests costs anywhere
from $800 to $1,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm gonna put 5,000 SKUs into the
market, it's gonna add whatever that math
[SPEAKER_00]: is to my sales price at each juncture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it continues to increase the price,
increase the price, increase the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also taxed at all of those levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I make a chocolate bar that costs
anywhere from two to three dollars to
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what the retail price of my
chocolate bar is?
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about 80% of that goes to taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no profit being made because
the government has their handout at every
[SPEAKER_00]: level of that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're trying to get done in New York
is we're trying to get New York to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand, look, you've already invented
the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got bodegas on every corner that
sell alcohol and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already have distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already know how to give these people
permits so you can make money on the
[SPEAKER_00]: permit of 200,000 bodegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can limit how much they can
sell, but you can let them sell at the
[SPEAKER_00]: corner store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the woman in curlers doesn't call her
plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes to the corner store and buys
legal, clean, tested cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you open the barrier of entry and
you allow all the citizens to access safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean cannabis and you don't tax it to
death, think about how much money they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: make in New York by giving everybody
access to it because guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody already has access to it in New
York.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the largest nascent cannabis market
in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The statistics are 200 metric tons of
cannabis are sold on the island of
[SPEAKER_00]: Manhattan every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did not make that number up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a low estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard it much higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard the lower estimate is 40 metric
tons of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well guess where all that comes from?
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the Californians selling it out
the back door because it's the only way
[SPEAKER_00]: they can keep themselves in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can learn from that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we need to do is really urge the
legislators to do a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: The list is number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go back here and talk about the
recession again because I know we all love
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reasonable tax rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they should take their money in volume
rather than having a few people allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: do cannabis and then taxing them to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you tax it too much, you're gonna
drive people to the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have lots of retail access
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give them lots of retail access
points, they have no reason to go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: nascent market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reasonable and achievable barrier of
entry, meaning if you are a legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis person, you've admittedly been
breaking the law for all of these years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the industry, I call them the roots
and the suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're sitting here with all the suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are the people that made sure
cannabis was available when our laws did
[SPEAKER_00]: not allow cannabis to be available on the
open, you know, openly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to embrace the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to let those people into the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to lower the barrier of entry for
them to get into the market because the
[SPEAKER_00]: suits have a lot to learn from the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do that, we're not gonna drive
people to the illicit market because what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to do is bring the illicit
market into the legal market, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to invite all of the people
who know everything about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna grow better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna provide better cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna have all of those lessons
that they've learned over the last 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna elevate the entire
industry by bringing the roots in.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the suits will say to me,
yeah, and they need us because we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: teach them how to do KPIs and we're gonna
teach them how to do business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna tell you, if you've been
running a business in an era that's
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal and you've been able to skirt all
of those laws, you're still growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're still packaging, you're still
manufacturing, and you're still selling at
[SPEAKER_00]: a retail level.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have more to teach us about running a
business than we probably have to teach
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably what we need to do is really
embrace the roots at a core level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can just teach them our
vernacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to learn about 15 vocabulary
words and then we're all gonna be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: same playing field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we bring the roots into the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next thing we need to do is
have strong social equity programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because the war on drugs in the
US and I've read in Europe has been a war
[SPEAKER_00]: on race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not about quashing drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Governments know that everyone's using
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the cannabis war on drugs has been is
putting black and brown people in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we need to do is get all the
black and brown people out of prison and
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to give them entry into this legal
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do that, as an industry,
we reduce the amount of people that go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also reduce the number of
taxes that we pay keeping people in
[SPEAKER_00]: prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Governments need to allow cannabis in all
its forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want edibles, they want beverages,
they want concentrates, they want all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what governments do is they go,
ooh, we're scared, we think we're only
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna let you have flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people want edibles, they're
gonna go get edibles in the illicit
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the government needs to do is accept
that cannabis is here, that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: using it and they need to let us have it
in all of its forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we do that, we actually then
increase the legal market, the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: tax the legal market, the bucket of money
gets bigger, and this is a way to combat
[SPEAKER_00]: the recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's the first time in my lifetime
that there's a new bucket of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always played monopoly with taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we're gonna give it to the military.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, no, no, I'm a Democrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna give it to education.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just moving it around on the playing
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if what we do is go get a new dollar
from the illicit market, we actually now
[SPEAKER_00]: can increase our economy by the impact
that cannabis will have on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to do is accept that cannabis
is here, it's legal, and we need to give
[SPEAKER_00]: the people who want it access to it in all
of its forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing that I think
governments need to do, hope you're all
[SPEAKER_00]: taking notes and that you're gonna go talk
to your legislators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is what really needs to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this for 12 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've watched countries, states,
legislators get it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we always end up back at the same
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that we have the biggest
illicit market in the United States in
[SPEAKER_00]: California?
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 3,000 legal dispensaries on
12-31-2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And California went wreck on 1-1-2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were 300 legal dispensaries the
next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 2,700 illicit shops,
because none of them closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then what happens is the consumer has
no idea that they're buying from an
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those dollars are not going into the
tax bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going into now somebody's hands
who does not have to lab test and who does
[SPEAKER_00]: not have to pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last thing that governments need to
do is stop doing milligram limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they're somehow protecting us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden in California,
you could buy 1,000 milligram chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: bar or cookie or concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next day after cannabis was made
legal, recreationally, you could only buy
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well guess what everyone did?
[SPEAKER_00]: They kept buying their 1,000 milligram
cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just bought it in the illegal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the lessons that we can
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do these things, if Germany
gets this right, and if they allow
[SPEAKER_00]: home-grow, and they allow consumption
lounges, and they allow high milligrams,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they allow cannabis in all of its
forms, and they embrace social equity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they lower the barrier of entry,
and they let you go buy cannabis in Aldi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go buy liquor in Aldi.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do those things, they're going to
have a bigger bucket of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be able to control the
cannabis market because they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have access at the point of sale
of the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to know who's buying it,
how much they're buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's in the illicit market,
we have no idea what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you allow a free market economy
to function the way it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people who are doing good business
stay in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people who are not doing good business
don't make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the hallmark of a free market
business economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them do business, and let them fail if
they're going to fail, and let them
[SPEAKER_00]: succeed if they're going to succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you legislate them to death,
everything becomes fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens now is we're in this
recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this high inflation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an opportunity in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are going to get your rules any
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm reading is everyone's
predicting that it's going to go wreck on
[SPEAKER_00]: 1-1, 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it'll take a year for them to get
their rules correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first legal cannabis will be sold
probably sometime in 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to take a couple of years
for all of that to get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's groups like this that can speak
to their legislatures and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: go learn from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go learn from Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go learn from Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brings me to the next point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany is what I consider an emerging
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now you've got medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have rec.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're learning in the US is that
the really, really advanced markets,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado, the Oregon, California,
Alaska, bless you, these markets are in a
[SPEAKER_00]: race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is selling for less money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard for operators to make
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the markets that have limited licenses
and that are new are the ones where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's limited competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those people have an opportunity to
make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're in a situation right now where
Germany is technically an emerging market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an opportunity to limit the
number of licenses, which I'm a proponent
[SPEAKER_00]: of having lots and lots of retail licenses
and then having your bottleneck at the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you limit the licenses at that
manufacturing level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also allow as many distributors to
exist as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get it to the people because people
are getting it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to do is talk to you about
what would happen if we are in a
[SPEAKER_00]: recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is it going to last?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm gonna take a poll.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you think that this economic
downturn is going to last longer than two
[SPEAKER_00]: years?
[SPEAKER_00]: One year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less than one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Few of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the majority of you think it's gonna
last more than one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average, I looked at the last five
bear markets starting in 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount that the market decreased was
37% and it was 546 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2002, 278 days, 34%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2008, 408 days, 52%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009, 62 days, that was COVID,
27%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 2020, 33 days, 34%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average bear market lasts 200 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: 365 days, so less than a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that the recession starts
July 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that it'll be over sometime in
March of 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's, my prediction is
that that's not what's gonna happen
[SPEAKER_00]: because of all of those things that I've
told you about the war in Ukraine,
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain, the gas situation in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm saying to you is,
if you have some liquidity, if you are an
[SPEAKER_00]: investor, cannabis is a great way to hedge
inflation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to diversify your
holdings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's recession resistant because it is
going to go up in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've got an excellent position in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get your legislator's minds right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop them from being fearful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all see that the emperor wears no
clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gotta get our legislators to see
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can get the entire cannabis
community to understand that this is what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're facing, we can be the ones,
this industry can be the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: single-handedly help governments beat this
recession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie Pearson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
