[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome everybody to national perspectives
evolution of the German market And I have
[SPEAKER_04]: the pleasure to have three absolute
experts here with me today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm to talk about this I mean everybody is
looking into Germany and what is happening
[SPEAKER_04]: right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some great interest coming up onto
that but More than that we have an
[SPEAKER_04]: existing industry also.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very interesting to see and get
some up-to-date insights from today Today
[SPEAKER_04]: from our experts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have on the left hand side Peter
Homburg He's a partner at Dentons an
[SPEAKER_04]: international law firm and he's head of
the Dentons European Cannabis Group as
[SPEAKER_04]: well as a founding member of the European
Cannabis Association He has been working
[SPEAKER_04]: in the lawyer as a lawyer in the field for
quite some time and in pharmaceutical law
[SPEAKER_04]: before that and has following the
legalization process For quite some time
[SPEAKER_04]: also from a legal perspective and then in
the middle we have Kai Friedrich Niemann
[SPEAKER_04]: Kai has been a business and corporate
lawyer in Germany since 2003 He has
[SPEAKER_04]: started legal blog.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Cannabis Menace legal with all
relevant information and for THC and CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: industry and Kai is also an advisor to the
European hemp industry the IHA and Which
[SPEAKER_04]: are working on the joint novel food
application at the moment with Kai support
[SPEAKER_04]: And in here we have dr. Cornelius Maura.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Cornelius Maura is the economist of
the three founders of Demekan and He's
[SPEAKER_04]: he's one of the three managing directors.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's responsible for finance and
procurement say it's a marketing
[SPEAKER_04]: fundraising and has worked with the BFM
and But now most more recently Cornelius
[SPEAKER_04]: also started looking into a venture
Venture funding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so let's get started straight away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Kai Let's start with you There's this
ongoing discussion about cannabis reform,
[SPEAKER_04]: but maybe before we dive into that Let's
have a quick look into the medical area
[SPEAKER_04]: and into CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your stance on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean in regard to the upcoming
legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay Yeah I think I will concentrate on
the CBD side of things CBD is very very
[SPEAKER_06]: complicated right now since the European
Union decided in 2019 to put CBD on the
[SPEAKER_06]: novel food catalogue, so the member states
of the EU decided that CBD extracts are
[SPEAKER_06]: novel food and Germany enforced this novel
food directive since 2019 very slowly we
[SPEAKER_06]: had the hype in 2019-2020-21 and then the
law enforcement took place and you will
[SPEAKER_06]: hardly find any CBD product CBD oil
labeled as food or as a food supplement on
[SPEAKER_06]: the German shelves of the big retailers
right now and the last resort was the
[SPEAKER_06]: cosmetic oral care product Cosmetisches
Mundpflegespray So at first it was labeled
[SPEAKER_06]: as a supplement and the second step was
aroma and the third step was aroma extract
[SPEAKER_06]: and the last resort was now the cosmetic
oral product and last week we got a ruling
[SPEAKER_06]: from the administrative court of
Düsseldorf saying that the ban of this
[SPEAKER_06]: product was illegal so and this the court
in Düsseldorf was referring to the court
[SPEAKER_06]: in Hamburg which also said that the ban of
this product the distribution ban was
[SPEAKER_06]: illegal and now we have this situation
that you can trade CBD oils in Hamburg and
[SPEAKER_06]: Düsseldorf but not in Berlin and not in
the south of Germany this is due to the
[SPEAKER_06]: structure of the health authority
oversight in Germany which makes it also
[SPEAKER_06]: very very complicated and I don't see any
solution of that so you have with these
[SPEAKER_06]: with these ruling you have two to three
years time to the main proceedings and
[SPEAKER_06]: probably by that the applications of AIHA
and different other players at the EU
[SPEAKER_06]: Commission for authorizing CBD extract as
a novel food will take place so it's due
[SPEAKER_06]: to the legalization efforts it's still
very hard to sell CBD and the CBD market
[SPEAKER_06]: is very very complicated and it doesn't
make any difference if you if you look at
[SPEAKER_04]: the legalization which is coming up that's
why I started with this question so maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: to to show you also that we have an
existing market where we are still facing
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of challenges here in Germany that
are independent of all these legalization
[SPEAKER_04]: efforts that are currently talked about
but maybe Peter could you explain what is
[SPEAKER_04]: the envisioned two-pillar model that we
see and what are the two pillars and what
[SPEAKER_04]: did the German government propose for that
thank you very much Lisa for the kind
[SPEAKER_07]: introduction I think everybody in this
room expected some good news from Germany
[SPEAKER_07]: moving into recreational I'm afraid we
don't have these good news let's look into
[SPEAKER_07]: what has happened since 2022 as you may
have followed the German government in
[SPEAKER_07]: 2022 in October 2022 released a position
paper in which they clearly outlined in
[SPEAKER_07]: which way legalization of recreational
cannabis and let's call it recreational
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis without using you just say
recreational cannabis in Germany it was
[SPEAKER_07]: very clearly outlined in which way Germany
would cultivate distribute and of course
[SPEAKER_07]: even control the use of cannabis under the
current government control that was the
[SPEAKER_07]: plan the government noticed that this may
in conflict with certain laws in
[SPEAKER_07]: particular with the Schengen agreement
which is the basis of the European Union
[SPEAKER_07]: and actually forwarded this pilot paper
together with an explanation and its
[SPEAKER_07]: arguments why they actually turned around
from a prohibition policy to a
[SPEAKER_07]: legalization policy to the European
Commission expecting that they at least
[SPEAKER_07]: not agree but I would say not it's not a
formal process so the European Commission
[SPEAKER_07]: looked at the paper and at the arguments
and the arguments were very much the same
[SPEAKER_07]: as Canada has used them for the
legalization of recreational cannabis as
[SPEAKER_07]: well which is better control of the
distribution of the cannabis for
[SPEAKER_07]: recreational purposes to protect the youth
better control for the consumers to get
[SPEAKER_07]: high quality products to the respective
user and of course to attack the illicit
[SPEAKER_07]: market the same arguments have been used
here well the European Commission said
[SPEAKER_07]: actually no this is going to violate the
Schengen agreement if you implement that
[SPEAKER_07]: in Germany we are going to initiate the
respective proceedings before the European
[SPEAKER_07]: Court of Justice for breach of contract of
the Schengen agreement so Germany turned
[SPEAKER_07]: around and now here comes the two new
pillar pro project it was released in
[SPEAKER_07]: April the two pillars are as follows
pillar number one Germany is going to
[SPEAKER_07]: allow the homegrown of up to three female
plants for every adult number one number
[SPEAKER_07]: two Germany is going to allow the
establishment of cannabis clubs I would
[SPEAKER_07]: call it cultivation associations because
that's what it really is each club each
[SPEAKER_07]: association can have up to 500 members and
can grow cannabis for their members for
[SPEAKER_07]: recreational purposes under very strict
control number three of that first pillar
[SPEAKER_07]: is that cannabis and THC rated products
will be taken out of the German Narcotics
[SPEAKER_07]: Act and will be actually transferred to
that new cannabis act with some impact
[SPEAKER_07]: also on the medical market which we may
discuss in a minute this is pillar number
[SPEAKER_07]: one a respective law has been leaked a
draft law has been leaked it's not yet
[SPEAKER_07]: released officially we have had a look at
that and of course there are a number of
[SPEAKER_07]: questions with regard to the
implementation of how is this actually
[SPEAKER_07]: working how does the cannabis cultivation
association really be controlled who is
[SPEAKER_07]: going to decide where and what is going to
be cultivated so how it's financed because
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a non-profit organization that thing
that's important to know this should be a
[SPEAKER_07]: non-profit organization so for every every
investor in this room this is bad news
[SPEAKER_07]: actually because they should not make any
money so this is the first pillar let me
[SPEAKER_07]: just introduce the second pillar if you
allow Lisa the second pillar is that
[SPEAKER_07]: Germany will start pilot scientific pilot
projects which are as we all know allowed
[SPEAKER_07]: under the UN conventions and the sharing
agreement under specific scientific
[SPEAKER_07]: control where distribution will be done
through properly licensed shops or
[SPEAKER_07]: licensed distributors to those who have
been registered and are going to use
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis for recreational purposes this is
not yet even a draft law it's just a plan
[SPEAKER_07]: probably the draft law will be released
after the summer break later this year
[SPEAKER_07]: with regard to the cannabis clubs or the
cannabis cultivation associations just two
[SPEAKER_07]: more facts number one there will be a
limit of 30 grams per month for adults of
[SPEAKER_07]: up to 21 so between 18 and 21 we have the
possibility to get 30 grams at a THC level
[SPEAKER_07]: of 10% or below oops number two adults can
actually purchase 50 grams with no THC
[SPEAKER_07]: limits from those cannabis cultivation
associations so that's what the laws
[SPEAKER_07]: current draft law says whether it will be
implemented in such way is of course
[SPEAKER_07]: questionable it's now discussed between
the ministries and will be actually
[SPEAKER_07]: forwarded to the cabinet probably not
before the summer break which starts in 14
[SPEAKER_04]: days thank you so Cornelius as one or the
only true German cultivator in Germany
[SPEAKER_04]: what is your stance on the current status
of the industry and what are you looking
[SPEAKER_04]: for in the future
[SPEAKER_01]: let's try it here good morning everybody
it's a pleasure to be here to see you all
[SPEAKER_01]: and thank you for having us on this panel
I I'd like to start with telling you a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit about our story and I think the
biggest challenges we faced in German
[SPEAKER_01]: market and then go to the evolution and
forecast of what the German market could
[SPEAKER_01]: look like so I think the biggest milestone
in Germany we saw in the past five years
[SPEAKER_01]: was the building of a national the
domestic supply chain so there were three
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses tendered out in 2018 for
cultivation of cannabis in Germany and the
[SPEAKER_01]: idea was to have an entire domestic supply
chain and as an operator in the space as a
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator as an importer as a processing
company Demicam we really saw this as a
[SPEAKER_01]: big challenge and we were very happy to be
able to start delivering last year now
[SPEAKER_01]: domestic supply chain I think it's
important to stretch this one because in
[SPEAKER_01]: the forecasted recreational cannabis space
it looks like in the draft law that all
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis needs to be produced in Germany
processed in Germany and we will have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a complete domestic supply chain also
in the recreational space and I know many
[SPEAKER_01]: companies who started as importers they
don't like it because they will have to
[SPEAKER_01]: pivot their business model to either build
their own cultivation space or rent or
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase production capacities at existing
production sites such as Demicam or Aurora
[SPEAKER_01]: or Tilray whether they want to so I think
yeah domestic supply chain was the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge and now we have it I think
there's a fair chance for the German
[SPEAKER_01]: market to be able to live up to what we
have to which is to supply the German
[SPEAKER_01]: market if we look at forecast for the
addressable market in the recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: space it's about 400 tons to be
conservative of those 400 tons how much we
[SPEAKER_01]: will see in a cannabis social club
scenario which is pillar one that Peter
[SPEAKER_01]: just introduced maybe 10% which is 40 tons
40 tons Demicam we could deliver half of
[SPEAKER_01]: that 20 tons easily on our production site
by scaling up and that within the first
[SPEAKER_01]: year of delivery so when you hear people
say oh we have to import because we have
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to supply the demand yeah we
don't have to we can't produce it in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany and there are also other market
players I look at York here in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: row who is building a production site so
there's initiative there's entrepreneurs
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to to jump into this gap and we
can do it now looking at the medical space
[SPEAKER_01]: what happened we saw some nice growth I
would say from 2021 to 2022 in 2021 we had
[SPEAKER_01]: nine tons of medical cannabis being sold
in pharmacies in 2022 we don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: official numbers but if you extrapolate
the official numbers until September 2022
[SPEAKER_01]: we had 11.4 tons that is 26% of growth
it's a small medical market but even if we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like the draft law for recreational
cannabis because it imposes many
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges for us as operators and market
players I think there is a chance to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually fight the black market and grow
interesting business models thank you so
[SPEAKER_04]: let's jump back over to you Kai what do
you think do you believe there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: possibility to establish legal frameworks
from out of Germany for Europe also no
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis can't be regulated in the EU for
the other sense right now if you look at
[SPEAKER_06]: countries like Sweden or Finland or
whatever they have a such a conservative
[SPEAKER_06]: approach to cannabis there won't be a
unanimous solution in the youth and in
[SPEAKER_06]: terms of cannabis I don't I don't think so
is so what's the option then I had the
[SPEAKER_06]: chance to talk to Czech officials in April
and in May and June I was listening to
[SPEAKER_06]: ginger which water check the federal drug
commissioner the pond or four of book
[SPEAKER_06]: albina in the Czech Republic and he was
saying they are working on a law in the
[SPEAKER_06]: Czech Republic to legalize cannabis and to
open a commercial route and they exactly
[SPEAKER_06]: know what's going to happen that there
might be a problem with the EU Commission
[SPEAKER_06]: with other member states and they face
that they say okay yeah let's let's get
[SPEAKER_06]: sued let's go to court let's go let's take
it to the ECG let's see what happens and
[SPEAKER_06]: if the ECG finally decides after five
years we have our industry established
[SPEAKER_06]: here and the industry won't vanish won't
disappear then anymore let's and if they
[SPEAKER_06]: have some some regulations or some some
guidelines we have to obey okay we will do
[SPEAKER_06]: that but we will work on this commercial
route and we will we will do it and they
[SPEAKER_06]: have a really interesting approach they
call it the psycho psycho-modulatory
[SPEAKER_06]: substances act so psycho-modulatory means
this will also cover low THC products like
[SPEAKER_06]: in Switzerland like up to 1% CBD flowers
like a kratom and it will also cover
[SPEAKER_06]: kratom and you will implement the measures
of regulation according to the dangers to
[SPEAKER_06]: the danger of the substance so if the
substance is really dangerous you will
[SPEAKER_06]: have more regulation if it is less
dangerous you will have less regulation
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think this is a very very modern
approach to to cannabis policy in terms of
[SPEAKER_06]: health issues but also in terms of human
rights so freedom of person to use
[SPEAKER_06]: substances and this is the only way so
small countries like I heard Slovenia has
[SPEAKER_06]: some some initiatives I heard last night
the Czech Republic has to move forward
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not the big countries showing the EU
how to regulate cannabis it will be the
[SPEAKER_06]: small countries move forward and find ways
to circumvent these still stand in the in
[SPEAKER_06]: the EU and in at the latest point it has
to be the courts but but but not the
[SPEAKER_06]: member states they won't be in unanimous
solutions it's single countries moving
[SPEAKER_06]: forward or at least the ECG has to decide
on that and if you have facts like you
[SPEAKER_06]: have an established market in the Czech
Republic after five years you want you
[SPEAKER_04]: can't draw back the the clock then anymore
Peter maybe also for you how do you think
[SPEAKER_04]: that the cannabis legalization efforts in
Germany will affect existing industries
[SPEAKER_04]: but also the illegal market and how well
this legal framework also maybe affect
[SPEAKER_04]: changes in the EU regulatory framework
regarding cannabis let's let's start with
[SPEAKER_07]: the the last part of the three questions
indeed as you pointed out there are a
[SPEAKER_07]: number of member states who see it
positively what the Germans are doing the
[SPEAKER_07]: approach of October 2022 was very much
supported by the Czech Republic anyway
[SPEAKER_07]: however there are other member states who
are relatively conservative or to say at
[SPEAKER_07]: least against the legalization of
recreational cannabis they are also a
[SPEAKER_07]: larger countries Germany would not go the
route as you described it for the Czech
[SPEAKER_07]: Republic because Germany lost big times
before the European Court of Justice in
[SPEAKER_07]: other subject matters just recently and as
such Germany is not going to take that
[SPEAKER_07]: route so they it's more a cautious
approach which they are taking coming back
[SPEAKER_07]: to your second question well the actual
argument of the legalization in Germany
[SPEAKER_07]: was to attack the illicit market and if
you look into the first pillar the
[SPEAKER_07]: question is is that really the right
instrument to do it if you allow a home
[SPEAKER_07]: grow if you allow cannabis cultivation of
course under the government control but as
[SPEAKER_07]: I said nonprofit it's still economically
questionable whether this will work may
[SPEAKER_07]: not be a good approach towards the illicit
market and for the protection of the youth
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to question that frankly
speaking the second pillar with the regard
[SPEAKER_07]: to the scientific pilot projects which we
see in other countries happening as well
[SPEAKER_07]: in particular for example in Switzerland
Germany is thinking about very much the
[SPEAKER_07]: same model I believe that this is even my
preferred solution taken to consideration
[SPEAKER_07]: the legal framework which we have within
the European Union Canada had it had
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't have that problem when they
actually legalized in 2019 they had just
[SPEAKER_07]: just the UN conventions they're getting
warning letters every year from the
[SPEAKER_07]: national international export but they
actually ignore that though that that was
[SPEAKER_07]: easier for them to implement because if
you question why is Germany taking that
[SPEAKER_07]: approach that's because of the Schengen
agreement and the respective protocols
[SPEAKER_07]: which have been released and which have
confirmed that still the European Union is
[SPEAKER_07]: following the prohibition of cannabis and
coming back to the last part of your
[SPEAKER_07]: question I don't see I don't see that very
much happening within the European Union
[SPEAKER_07]: we will see more and more approaches
towards the legalization of recreational
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis within certain European countries
but this will take some time and the
[SPEAKER_07]: Germany is believing that with the
experience they are having within these
[SPEAKER_07]: two pillar models for a period of four
years they have sufficient proof that the
[SPEAKER_07]: legalization has a positive impact on the
society has a positive impact on the
[SPEAKER_07]: attacking the illicit market which we see
indeed growing every year and of course
[SPEAKER_07]: what you can buy on the illicit market has
in certain aspects nothing to do with any
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of quality or high quality cannabis
products cannabis flowers as we see it
[SPEAKER_07]: which are manufactured for example by the
demikon and the other local this local
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivators here in Germany thank you very
much so Cornelius what do you think how
[SPEAKER_04]: will the cannabis regulation also impact
existing industries like the medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry in Germany for example
well if we look at Canada or United States
[SPEAKER_01]: we can assume that certain product
categories will contract in the sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: for example flower we already have between
30 to 50 percent of self-paying patients
[SPEAKER_01]: most of them one can fairly assume our
consumers and not are necessarily treating
[SPEAKER_01]: pain issues so we will see a decline in
flower sales that's for sure after an
[SPEAKER_01]: initial increase why is that because what
Peter described about how they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize the recreational market it's
putting cannabis away from a narcotic
[SPEAKER_01]: status to a non narcotic and prescriptions
will very likely at least double or triple
[SPEAKER_01]: in the beginning and once the cannabis
social clubs are then open for
[SPEAKER_01]: prescription and for becoming a member and
actually buying product then we will
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly see in the product category of
flower a steep decline I don't see
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily a big change for extracts so
in the kind of medical cannabis space you
[SPEAKER_01]: have flower you have extracts you have
ready-made pharmaceuticals for extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: ready-made pharmaceuticals ready-made
pharmaceuticals I don't see that much
[SPEAKER_01]: change now if you look at the market
players many of them have been set up to
[SPEAKER_01]: not only serve the medical space but
potentially also be a big player in the
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational space some of the market
players want to stay in the medical space
[SPEAKER_01]: and say that very clearly others such as
Damican we found this company with a clear
[SPEAKER_01]: view on regulation in Canada and the
United States and we saw medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: will be legalized first very likely and
recreational cannabis eventually will
[SPEAKER_01]: follow and that was the initial plan from
the beginning so for those who want to
[SPEAKER_01]: pivot I mentioned earlier they if they
want to play in the first round they have
[SPEAKER_01]: to become domestic cultivators or get
access to domestic product which will be a
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge I guess for many mostly a time
challenge I think a fair assumption for
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody starting now to get a building
permit to get the funding to build the
[SPEAKER_01]: facility to get the cultivars to get do
test runs you need at least two years so
[SPEAKER_01]: this will be what everybody's had will be
around thank you very much I would open
[SPEAKER_04]: first like a warm round of applause for
the panelists and then I would hand over
[SPEAKER_04]: because I bet there are many questions in
that regard for the German market so look
[SPEAKER_05]: they're all excited okay I'm coming by the
way when we take the break after this
[SPEAKER_05]: panel for coffee and refreshments we
invite you to visit our exhibitors 3c in
[SPEAKER_05]: ZTE Talman group Vivaldi's Nabi and the
state of Victoria in Australia please help
[SPEAKER_05]: our exhibitors out and now the question hi
good morning thank you very much I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: sure if I should ask for my money back I
come from South Africa we have over 90
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses awarded by the regulator and most
of the talk fueled by the government as
[SPEAKER_03]: one might call it is that South Africa is
potentially a huge contributor to the
[SPEAKER_03]: global cannabis scene and of course
Germany takes prize of place as the market
[SPEAKER_03]: to which all of Africa should aspire to
export from what I'm hearing here unless I
[SPEAKER_03]: misunderstood Germany is actually closing
down and Europe potentially thereafter
[SPEAKER_03]: with regards to allowing the import of
cannabis let's talk a medical cannabis at
[SPEAKER_03]: this point in time but there is a huge
developing capacity for cannabis growing
[SPEAKER_03]: in Africa and particularly in South Africa
under the illusion that we grow it better
[SPEAKER_03]: we have better land race we do it cheaper
our currencies feeble and neither the
[SPEAKER_03]: Canadians nor the Europeans know how to
grow cannabis like we do and therefore the
[SPEAKER_03]: future is ahead of us this is just a
belief from what I'm hearing here this is
[SPEAKER_03]: simply not the case it's all illusory the
biggest mark is going to grow it for
[SPEAKER_03]: itself call it what you want to
self-protection and therefore Africa has
[SPEAKER_03]: to look to itself mind you apparently we
smoke three tons a day in South Africa but
[SPEAKER_03]: still but still recreational cannabis
isn't legal just yet the clubs have not
[SPEAKER_03]: been approved by the courts and those of
us who are medical cannabis cultivators
[SPEAKER_03]: have invested a great deal at the highest
end seeking EU GMP certification by the
[SPEAKER_03]: way under the advice of European
consultants and this all looks like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: nonsense so I everybody here is very aware
that many countries have been scaling up
[SPEAKER_01]: especially to be able to supply Germany
and Europe with a world-class high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: EU GMP great cannabis and I think they
will be able to continue for the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: space this is clear in the draft law you
can export raw material send it to
[SPEAKER_01]: operators processors such as Demicam we
transform it into EU GMP great cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be sold in the German market in
the European market or any equivalent
[SPEAKER_01]: market with EU GMP requirements but for
the domestic recreational cannabis market
[SPEAKER_01]: it will be domestic only supply chain this
is what says the law I don't judge it I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean obviously I'm happy about it but this
is what we have and and let me add there
[SPEAKER_07]: is still huge potential in the German
medical market we are far away from any
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of market saturation there are
there's a lot of more potential here what
[SPEAKER_07]: are the hurdles for physicians to
prescribe cannabis currently there are a
[SPEAKER_07]: number of hurdles but it is of course also
it's a narcotic number one number two the
[SPEAKER_07]: information which the physicians have and
we have just discussed with a greater
[SPEAKER_07]: group of physicians about the
possibilities to prescribe cannabis what
[SPEAKER_07]: are the preconditions when can a physician
prescribe cannabis what are the the the
[SPEAKER_07]: regulations for that we need more
education I think and that's part actually
[SPEAKER_07]: calling the industry more education of the
physicians to feel more comfortable to
[SPEAKER_07]: prescribe cannabis as a medicine there are
lots of potential in there and still I
[SPEAKER_07]: believe that for the medical market there
is still the need of imports the medical
[SPEAKER_07]: market also in the future with regard to
this high quality EU GMP certified
[SPEAKER_07]: products will not be probably not be
satisfied by the by the current domestic
[SPEAKER_07]: market we will definitely see imports in
the future we don't know what is the
[SPEAKER_07]: future of medical cannabis cultivation in
Germany it's not yet maybe you know more
[SPEAKER_07]: than I but Cornelius I have not seen
anything from the Bayfarm yet in which way
[SPEAKER_07]: they will renew or increase the respective
quotas which you have because you know
[SPEAKER_07]: that the cultivators in Germany have a
limit of 10.4 tons for a period of four
[SPEAKER_07]: years plus an additional 10% if I'm not
mistaken that is only part a small part of
[SPEAKER_07]: what the medical market is actually
needing that's the reason why we are
[SPEAKER_07]: looking into even the future imports so
there is space for improvement yeah let me
[SPEAKER_06]: let me add to that there is the the most
of the medical cannabis import companies
[SPEAKER_06]: in Germany they have done their sourcing
globally so they have stable supply chains
[SPEAKER_06]: now be it from Colombia be it from Canada
be it from South Africa but I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_06]: only look there is potential in the German
market especially if cannabis is moved
[SPEAKER_06]: from the Necotics Act prescription would
probably rise double triple whatever but
[SPEAKER_06]: still a very small market it's only 25
tons were imported and dispensed 11 tons
[SPEAKER_06]: dispensed to the pharmacies there is still
potential but I wouldn't look only to
[SPEAKER_06]: Germany almost every European country is
setting up a medical cannabis program and
[SPEAKER_06]: if you look at the UK they have only five
indications in Germany there is no limit
[SPEAKER_06]: of indications and won't be afterwards so
look at the other EU states as well which
[SPEAKER_06]: are setting we're setting up the kind of
medical cannabis programs for for chances
[SPEAKER_01]: to to business or to export and I must add
there is maybe hope for those producing
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of Europe that the law initiative
might change this is possible and one way
[SPEAKER_01]: it could change is they try to ease access
to cannabis by making it an OTC so that
[SPEAKER_01]: could be a potential way but this is not
what is proposed right now so I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: pointing out at the potential alternatives
path but right now as I said it's domestic
[SPEAKER_07]: only and maybe one more remark to that the
second pillar the scientific pilot
[SPEAKER_07]: projects of course have also a need for
supply so the question is do we see under
[SPEAKER_07]: the first pillar the cultivation
associations popping up like mushrooms
[SPEAKER_07]: everywhere serving the needs of the
members and who is going to serve later on
[SPEAKER_07]: the scientific pilot projects how how wide
will they spread it out into Germany
[SPEAKER_07]: that's every city has these implementation
of scientific pilot projects has it every
[SPEAKER_07]: state we see that in Switzerland we have
two projects which started actually
[SPEAKER_07]: earlier this year in Switzerland in in
Basel and in Zurich and we will probably
[SPEAKER_07]: learn from that a little bit more but
Germany is significantly larger than
[SPEAKER_07]: Switzerland so we'll see what how this
market how this demand will be then served
[SPEAKER_02]: this will be interesting to see okay this
is targeted mainly for you Cornelius but I
[SPEAKER_02]: see that Peter is in agreement that
there's some kind of importation in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future Cornelius you're not for
importation let me just say this I spent
[SPEAKER_02]: five years in Jamaica recently I saw the
program from the beginning to disaster a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of good things did happen but that's a
medical program but they make it easy you
[SPEAKER_02]: go into the dispensary you make a phone
call to a doctor that's on board and they
[SPEAKER_02]: give you your medical card right there and
then you purchase your flour or your other
[SPEAKER_02]: products when it comes to consumption when
Europe finally takes these steps baby
[SPEAKER_02]: steps now I suppose the consumption is
going to be huge but millions of pounds a
[SPEAKER_02]: month the craft grows the the grow that
you talked about that you provide what you
[SPEAKER_02]: say 40 tons a year something like that it
doesn't make a dent in the overall require
[SPEAKER_02]: some consumption that you're going to have
so importation there's so many countries
[SPEAKER_02]: that are better geographically to grow
than in Germany you're gonna have very
[SPEAKER_02]: high costs here because of energy you have
to build you know facilities buildings
[SPEAKER_02]: whatnot you know I'm talking about
Columbia mainly they've been shipping for
[SPEAKER_02]: a hundred years so my question is
Cornelius would you be open to the idea
[SPEAKER_02]: that importation has a place as maybe a
contingency plan but we shouldn't I think
[SPEAKER_02]: politic against importation because I
don't think you import call you don't grow
[SPEAKER_02]: coffee here or bananas or other things you
go to the geographical areas where it best
[SPEAKER_02]: grows at the most economical prices and
the volume that you're going to need yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: so for the medical space for sure this
will continue the government hasn't said
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that contradicts this assumption
that importation will be possible and we
[SPEAKER_01]: agree that there will be an increase in
prescriptions once it's delisted from
[SPEAKER_01]: being a narcotic on the recreational side
it is what the government proposes
[SPEAKER_01]: domestic only supply chain and I know it's
hard to hear but this is what's black on
[SPEAKER_01]: white and this is in line what happened
with the legalization of recreation
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in Canada no imports I hear you
loud and clear but it is how regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: moves and this it's what is being proposed
here in Germany and let me add that under
[SPEAKER_07]: the first pillar there is no need for
importation the first pillar is home pro
[SPEAKER_07]: and the cultivation associations so there
is there's no need even for for any kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of cultivation of for recreational
purposes here in Germany at this point in
[SPEAKER_07]: time under the first pillar if it comes
into place the second pillar is different
[SPEAKER_07]: there we may have to see what's going to
happen still the plan of the government is
[SPEAKER_07]: domestic cultivation will serve even that
market on the second pillar which are the
[SPEAKER_05]: scientific pilot projects and okay I'm
sorry I'm sorry to cut you off we're
[SPEAKER_05]: running out of time we have one more I'm
gonna try to slide one more question in
[SPEAKER_05]: because he's been very patient and then
everyone else when we go for coffee and
[SPEAKER_05]: pastries you can pile around these guys
and and pester them to your heart's desire
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you hi I'm Nicholas from Colombia so
I wouldn't go as far as saying that we
[SPEAKER_00]: grow the best cannabis as a guy from South
Africa say but we're pretty good at
[SPEAKER_00]: large-scale and good premium quality
flowers at a good price I don't want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: too deep into the hundred years of exports
of marijuana you know from my country so
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna put that aside but I want
to say this I agree that the government is
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that it has to be domestic only for
recreational space right but we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about the consumers in Germany
when it comes to pricing you know and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that you guys as pioneers and voices
to be here in the Germany legislation to
[SPEAKER_00]: be done I think it will be good and very
important to be here in the part that
[SPEAKER_00]: probably some imports are going to be
needed in order to accomplish that market
[SPEAKER_00]: in a good price and in a good quality we
are very aware the German cultivators are
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna be you know producing at a very
affordable price so if we put some imports
[SPEAKER_00]: from countries that are doing a good job
you know could make actually a good point
[SPEAKER_01]: for consumers yeah thank you for raising
this point production costs I love it
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a huge misunderstanding
here Demicam produces locally domestically
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's about one quarter of our top line
and the other three quarters come from
[SPEAKER_01]: importation so we have several global
suppliers and I know the prices for which
[SPEAKER_01]: I buy and I know the price for which I
produce domestically and we produce full
[SPEAKER_01]: production costs below two euros at one
ton annual production capacity so if we
[SPEAKER_01]: scale that goes down and I buy some
product below two euros EUGMP grade all
[SPEAKER_01]: raw material but most of them are more
expensive and I know they might be
[SPEAKER_01]: produced cheaper but if you look at the
market prices we're actually cheaper in
[SPEAKER_01]: producing it ourselves here in Germany so
please keep that in mind okay thank you
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry to cut everybody off I know you
all had a lot of questions the great panel
[SPEAKER_05]: let's hear it and
