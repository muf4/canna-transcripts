[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're gonna keep the knowledge
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next panel is called Cannabis
Deconstructed and our next speaker is a
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroscientist with more than 20
peer-reviewed articles and publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the founder and CEO of MediTourist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please give a warm welcome for Mr. Dr.
Jouboukis Jouboukis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Alex and ICBC organizers for
doing this great meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my third opportunity to share some
knowledge and to challenge our thinking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I joined ICBC in 2016 in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was here last year in Berlin and it was
so good that we all decided that we should
[SPEAKER_01]: be back here again this year and it's a
pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Joukoubas Jouboukis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's easy to butcher it so I go by
Dr. Z and my students favorite is Dr. Jay
[SPEAKER_01]: Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without further ado I'm gonna talk
about cannabis deconstructed and I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you some of the some of the thoughts
that I have about cannabis and before we
[SPEAKER_01]: start talking about cannabis we can start
talking about constructing the human body
[SPEAKER_01]: system that is called the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all mammals have endocannabinoid system
even some more primitive animals and
[SPEAKER_01]: animals and creatures that live in the sea
they also have the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoid system is very
complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is widely distributed throughout the
body so it is not just found in one
[SPEAKER_01]: location.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is essentially found in almost every
cell in our bodies and if you look at this
[SPEAKER_01]: chart what it shows you is cannabinoid
receptors cannabinoid receptor 1 and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid receptor 2 are distributed
differently in different organs and our
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies produces endocannabinoids so we
generate ourselves cannabinoids as needed
[SPEAKER_01]: and thus we sometimes need supplement of
cannabinoid that comes exogenously as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So endocannabinoids the major ones are
anandamide and 2-AG or arachidonyl
[SPEAKER_01]: glycerol and these endocannabinoids bind
cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoid receptor 1 CB1 is mostly
expressed in the brain also and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: the effect of cancer but you will also
find CB1 receptors in liver and the
[SPEAKER_01]: digestive system in kidneys in bladder so
it is widely expressed throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: body.
[SPEAKER_01]: CB2 receptors are more expressed in the
organs and cells that are related to the
[SPEAKER_01]: immune response and it is widely
distributed throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first boost of the endocannabinoids
and engagement of endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_01]: happens with birth and with suckling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is something that makes you hungry that
makes you eat and only after you eat you
[SPEAKER_01]: get a boost of dopamine which gives you
the satisfaction for eating but something
[SPEAKER_01]: makes you go eat and it is probably the
endocannabinoids because this is one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the functions of endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They modulate pain and stress,
immune function, appetite, memory,
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation, thermoregulation and
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And endocannabinoids such as THC for
example are similar in structure to
[SPEAKER_01]: anandamide and thus they will bind the
same receptors as does anandamide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this interaction here is pretty
complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can think of endocannabinoids or
cannabinoids binding to the receptors in a
[SPEAKER_01]: key and a lock like fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, endocannabinoids is not that
simple and several cannabinoids for
[SPEAKER_01]: example THC and CBD will bind the same
receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore the receptor which can be
represented here by a door and the
[SPEAKER_01]: function of the door is to be open and
closed appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: The function of the receptor to be
activated or deactivated appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to engage this
endocannabinoid system in receptors,
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple molecules have to bind to these
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And multiple locks exist on these
receptors in order to regulate properly
[SPEAKER_01]: the function of these receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if we look at what happens in the
brain and also what happens many places in
[SPEAKER_01]: the body, this is a simplified example
which is still complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when neurons are active, what happens
is neurons produce a lot of electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: positive charge that is called
depolarization.
[SPEAKER_01]: That depolarization allows for calcium to
influx and allows for the neurotransmitter
[SPEAKER_01]: vesicles that are chemicals that signal in
our brain and body to be released in the
[SPEAKER_01]: synapse between two neurons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the release of these neurotransmitters
and increased excitation and
[SPEAKER_01]: depolarization and in particular I'm
talking here about glutamate excitator
[SPEAKER_01]: neurotransmitter on demand will then
produce the synthesis of endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: These endocannabinoids are not stored in
the vesicles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will cross freely through the
plasma membranes, will travel retrogradely
[SPEAKER_01]: and will bind CB receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CB receptors are located on neurons,
but the CB2 receptors as well as CB1
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors are also located on other type
of brain cells that are called glia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also very important in information
processing and brain function.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a system where endocannabinoids
are synthesized on demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pass through the membranes and they
activate CB receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is no control of glutamate,
you can have glutamate excitotoxicity,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can also have calcium excitotoxicity
and CB1 receptor activation turns off the
[SPEAKER_01]: influx of calcium and regulates the
release of the neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thereby balancing the excitotoxicity
inhibitory activity, not just glutamate or
[SPEAKER_01]: gamma-aminobutyric acid or GABA in the
neuronal synapses as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in the brain, CB1 and CB2 receptors
again are expressed in many different
[SPEAKER_01]: structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that this is CB1 receptor
that is abundant in structures such as
[SPEAKER_01]: hippocampus, for example, which is
responsible for learning memory and
[SPEAKER_01]: stress, but also in the frontal cortex,
which is responsible for executive
[SPEAKER_01]: functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is also expressed in the brainstem that
controls some of the vital functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, the opiate receptors in the
brainstem are expressed in the part that
[SPEAKER_01]: controls the breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, it is easy to die from opiates
and have an overdose by shutting down the
[SPEAKER_01]: breathing centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cannabinoid receptors are actually
located in the areas nearby in the
[SPEAKER_01]: brainstem that control nausea and
vomiting, but they're not expressed in the
[SPEAKER_01]: breathing centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other receptor targets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So endocannabinoids do not just bind CB
receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They target other receptors, and it
explains the multitude of functions and
[SPEAKER_01]: the multitude of effects that people are
seeing from either one phytocannabinoid or
[SPEAKER_01]: the group of phytocannabinoids in the case
of extractions and isolates of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: TRPV1 receptor is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your sensory afference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the receptor that essentially
mediates analgesic functions or pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So endocannabinoids target TRPV1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also target PPAR, or paroxysome
proliferator-activated receptor,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is involved in tumorigenesis,
metabolism development,
[SPEAKER_01]: self-differentiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also targets GPR55, which is a
protein-coding receptor, but its
[SPEAKER_01]: physiological function is not completely
known.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole idea is massive and complex
regulatory system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a homeostatic regulatory system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has multiple targets, multiple
receptors, and it's expressed throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to engage the endocannabinoid system,
you have stress, you have trauma,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have hyper-excitability in the tissues
or in the brain, you have inflammation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the response of the endocannabinoid
system is eat, make you hungry,
[SPEAKER_01]: go eat, rest and sleep, get drowsy and
sleep, forget, because it's important to
[SPEAKER_01]: forget things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forgetting is an important part of the
survival.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we remembered everything, we would be
overloaded mentally, psychologically,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also protect the neuroprotection by
controlling neurotransmitters,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also a significant role in gastric
protection and regulation of the digestive
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: This endocannabinoid system is regulating
our body, which is teetering constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: between excitation and inhibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a fine system, our brains and
bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sensitive system, but it is
balanced, more or less, between the
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions of the endocannabinoids
multitude of neurotransmitters in our
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endocannabinoid system, again,
can be modulated, and we can talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: how we can modulate endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing that comes to mind,
of course, is synthetic pharmaceuticals,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as synthetic THC that has been on the
market for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly, synthetic THC that's
pharmaceutical is on schedule two and on
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule three, and THC that is natural
from the plant is on schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: One substance is actually listed on three
schedules.
[SPEAKER_01]: The justification is that there are
additives added into these medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are no proof that these
additives are working biologically
[SPEAKER_01]: independently or making THC that is
synthetic more effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have therapeutic approaches to
modulating endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, we can modulate the synthesis
and the degradation of endocannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of the synthesis happens through
this molecule called AAH.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can modulate CB1 and CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have supplements with exogenous
phytocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to remember that when we talk
about phytocannabinoids and supplements,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not just talking about smoking
cannabis and rolling joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fastest growing demographic of
cannabis users are baby boomers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they are very interested in many
different preparations of how to use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, and a lot of times they don't
want to necessarily smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reports of cannabis positively modulating
mental and physiological processes are
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always tell this industry needs to stop
saying that this is an anecdote as an
[SPEAKER_01]: example, because when you go to any
medical meeting, these anecdotes attract
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to cannabis or cannabis
use, they become anecdotes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's thousands of anecdotes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know that the research has been
restricted and is still restricted on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, not on synthetic cannabinoids,
but on cannabis, and it's very limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, there may be inconclusive
evidence, and you can set your own
[SPEAKER_01]: stringency level and factual information
that you involve in this decision to make
[SPEAKER_01]: whether the cannabis is effective medicine
for certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's deconstruct cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just talked about the
endocannabinoid system, and we
[SPEAKER_01]: deconstructed the system into receptors,
into the endocannabinoids, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution of the system throughout the
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's deconstruct cannabis,
because cannabis as medicine has been
[SPEAKER_01]: reported by Chinese Emperor Shen Nong,
and is written up in the Peng Tao Qing,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the first book of herbs,
essentially of herbal healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the emperor was growing cannabis and
using it for medicinal purposes and was
[SPEAKER_01]: really trying to understand what kind of
cannabis is being grown and what it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: used for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the action in cannabis in the
plant is in the cannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes that are mostly located in these
very beautiful trichomes on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's approximately three different
types of trichomes that are different by
[SPEAKER_01]: size, and these trichomes will contain
these glands, will contain the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids as well as the aromatic
molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about some basic misconceptions
that exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: What distinguishes really hemp or
industrial hemp from medical or adult-use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis or recreational cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that distinguishes the
two is THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there are differences in the
way the plant itself looks, but the only
[SPEAKER_01]: real difference is the expression level of
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at the industrial hemp,
cannabis sativa, cannabis ruderalis,
[SPEAKER_01]: by regulators, the amount of THC is set at
0.2% in Europe, but not in every country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland has it at 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who regulates 0.2, 0.3, 0.5% or 1%?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature does, because you can have a
certified seed and you can have a
[SPEAKER_01]: certified plant that is supposed to have
0.2 or below level of THC, but with
[SPEAKER_01]: certain growth condition and maybe more
sun, all of a sudden can jump to 0.4,
[SPEAKER_01]: 0.5% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, a lot of farmers that get
punished for that, they have no way of
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have done everything right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't control the nature because the
plants are grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And naturally, industrial hemp plants
actually like to have 0.5 to 1% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: High THC cannabis is sativa and indica and
mostly hybrids now that are in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The highest percentage of cannabinoids
that these plants can express is up into
[SPEAKER_01]: the 30% of THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's simply just limited by the genetic
material and genetic mechanism of
[SPEAKER_01]: production of these molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a finite limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no plant that can produce 65% of
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will all get cut off around 30%,
35%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what I really don't like is when
people call synthetic cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic marijuana or synthetic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a whole article written on this and
I encourage you to find it my name and if
[SPEAKER_01]: you look up synthetic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Synthetic street cannabinoids or so-called
label the synthetic marijuana is
[SPEAKER_01]: non-synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should not be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should not be accessible and it is
widely accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is designed in the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is designed by what I would call evil
scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are in China and Eastern
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is essentially putting chemicals
together and mixing them together to get
[SPEAKER_01]: to a powder-like form that looks like
powder and then sprinkle that powder-like
[SPEAKER_01]: form on the plant material, which can be
tobacco or another plant material,
[SPEAKER_01]: label it a spice or kush, put incense on
it and put it in all of the head shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the government cannot keep track of it
because new formulations, new variations
[SPEAKER_01]: of these cannabinoids, synthetic
cannabinoids that are deadly and dangerous
[SPEAKER_01]: are coming out and they are being released
with different labels constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is probably over 70 different
variations of synthetic cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_01]: are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are addictive, they are dangerous and
they are deadly and they have nothing to
[SPEAKER_01]: do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows tall and most of the high THC
cannabis, at least it is bred to be below
[SPEAKER_01]: three meters in height or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to tell you that I found this
picture recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 1930s in Vilnius, which is the
capital of Lithuania where Lithuanians and
[SPEAKER_01]: Polish, it was then under the Polish
control, the city of Vilnius, not only
[SPEAKER_01]: grew this fantastic hemp, grew this giant
hemp that went all the way up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: four-story tall limits essentially,
but it was also the first botanical and
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal fiber institute that was open in
Vilnius in Lithuania in 1930s,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the first ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it still maintains itself in Poznan
and has the second largest seed bank for
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The largest bank for seeds for cannabis is
in Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this in our history in
Lithuania.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just Holland, it's not just Bob
Marley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before Bob Marley was born, we were
already experimenting and we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: research facility for cannabis and
textiles for cannabis in Lithuania.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, cannabis consists of a diverse set of
phyto compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people call it, and Lemir Hanus,
one of the professors that's my idol,
[SPEAKER_01]: 1,001 compounds, 1,001 molecules in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's over 115 phyto cannabinoids,
a number of terpenes, about 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, analytical labs, the maximum
they test for I think is steep hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's about 40 plus cannabinoid spectrum
or terpene spectrum that they test for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we still don't know a lot about these
other 60 to 80 terpenes that are found in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, flavonoids, as well as amino
acids, omega amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very valuable plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to think about it from many
different perspectives, not just from
[SPEAKER_01]: intoxication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that's interesting
about the plant is that this plant doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: produce THC and doesn't produce CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually produces acidic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: 95% or so, all of the cannabinoids that
are expressed in the plant are acidic
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, such as THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: THCA is non-intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis plant is actually
non-intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is heating or processing that cannabis
plant or decarboxylation process that
[SPEAKER_01]: turns THCA into THC, CBD into CBD,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And THC then has the euphoric effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC also is known as intoxicating
agent, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective,
[SPEAKER_01]: analgesic, appetite stimulant,
anti-emetic, anti-cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it all just good and dandy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it work for everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it work for everything and make
everybody happy?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is not for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is not for every person.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not for every patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis can cause anxiety, can cause
panic attacks, can increase heart rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's low rate of addiction for cannabis
or cannabis dependency, we can call it,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as this hyperemesis syndrome from
high use or constant chronic use of high
[SPEAKER_01]: THC cannabinoids that's emerging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this coughing and vomiting-like
syndrome in the morning, which usually
[SPEAKER_01]: gets fixed by taking a hot shower or using
capsaicin from pepper, which binds to trip
[SPEAKER_01]: V1 receptors because that's the mechanism
that gets impaired in hyperemesis
[SPEAKER_01]: syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD is really the therapeutic champion
of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually counteracts negative effects
of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be anti-anxiety and anti-panic
attacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anti-psychotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have negative effects,
fatigue and drowsiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have to pay attention to some of
the latest literature from epilepsy that
[SPEAKER_01]: suggests that both THC and CBD could
potentially be pro-convulsant in 10% of
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to be cautious of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD cannabidiol, what it does,
it blocks the enzymatic breakdown of the
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule FAAH, which synthesizes
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it increases the production and
presence of the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It rapidly crosses blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's non-psychoactive, but I prefer to use
non-intoxicating because nicotine is
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactive, coffee is psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Psychotropic is different or intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD is not intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It counteracts THC effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of evidence in human
epilepsy with CBD and lots of diverse case
[SPEAKER_01]: studies using CBD, THC, and also a
combination of THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's emerging at least from
unpublished literature is that this ratio
[SPEAKER_01]: of THC, CBD, and also from existing drugs
such as Sativex, which is one-to-one THC
[SPEAKER_01]: and CBD, that this ratio of THC and CBD is
also very important in different
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I urge you to look at this Health
Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was published by the National Academy
of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where the brightest minds got together
and reviewed all of the literature that's
[SPEAKER_01]: available, and this is what they decided,
not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is conclusive or substantial
evidence that cannabis and cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in this case is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoids in this case are synthetic
pharmaceuticals or plant-based
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals such as Epidiolex or
Sativex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conclusive evidence for the treatment of
chronic pain, anti-emetic, improvement of
[SPEAKER_01]: patient-reported multiple sclerosis,
plasticity symptoms, oral cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is moderate evidence that cannabis
or cannabinoids are effective for
[SPEAKER_01]: improving short-term sleep outcomes in
individuals with sleep disturbances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you will see that there's also a lot
of limited evidence that cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids are effective for THC,
for Tourette syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Limited evidence that it is effective for
traumatic brain injury, intracranial
[SPEAKER_01]: hemorrhage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Limited evidence that cannabis are
effective symptoms, ineffective for
[SPEAKER_01]: improving symptoms associated with
dementia and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is definitely proof that it
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also conclusive evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think again, we just need more
science and more studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing to keep in mind, of course,
when we talk about addiction, is addiction
[SPEAKER_01]: is a very complex process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's intertwined with many different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we look, cannabis addiction,
cannabis has the highest scores,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is less addictive than caffeine
according to Benowitz ratings here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the higher the score, the less
addictive is the substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that nicotine is a lot
more addictive than marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: and marijuana can be less addictive than
caffeine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yesterday, a politician said that
cannabis should not be consumed as coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to ask why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it causes a different intoxicating
effect, but not from the safety
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the safety standpoint,
marijuana here, the lower the number on
[SPEAKER_01]: this side, and the lower the plant or
substances on the y-axis, the lower it's
[SPEAKER_01]: on the y-axis, the less dependency
potential there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lower the number on the x-axis,
that means the dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the active dose and lethal
dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is one to one, that means the active
dose, something that eliminates your pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: also kills you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lethal dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: With cannabis, it's .001, which is a
thousand times of the active dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if one rolled joint gets you high,
you need to consume about a thousand in a
[SPEAKER_01]: matter of few minutes, which is
impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is easier to do it with caffeine,
which is only a hundred times more of the
[SPEAKER_01]: effective dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is, of course, a big problem with
other drugs, including opiates and
[SPEAKER_01]: morphine, where only ten times the dose,
including alcohol, only ten times of the
[SPEAKER_01]: effective dose, is lethal.
[SPEAKER_01]: From safety perspective, cannabis could be
argued that it is safer than caffeine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have a lot of overdoses from
benzodiazepines.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are epilepsy drugs, mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the rise in these deaths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is thousands of deaths,
from thousand deaths in 2002, 2015,
[SPEAKER_01]: five to six thousand deaths from
benzodiazepines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have very high morbidity and mortality
rate from opiates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 73.8 of all prescription overdose
deaths were due to opioid pain relievers.
[SPEAKER_01]: OPR, it's a study published by CDC.
[SPEAKER_01]: OPR sales, nonetheless, quadrupled between
99 and 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it causes insurers about 72.4 U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars in U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: annually in healthcare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a report from 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, I think we had a rise in
opioid epidemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think these numbers would probably
look even worse at this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now deaths from cannabis, zero reported
deaths from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opiates, of course, are used for the
treatment of chronic pains, severe pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked at one of the studies,
a prominent study, a Journal of Pain
[SPEAKER_01]: Research in 2017, a cross-sectional study
of 2,800 approximately individuals and
[SPEAKER_01]: they showed that about 1248 of these
individuals, 48%, respondents reported
[SPEAKER_01]: using cannabis as a substitute for
prescription drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most common cases, classes of
drugs substituted are narcotics,
[SPEAKER_01]: about 36%, anxiolytics, benzodiazepines,
and antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the patients report
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a very stringent study,
but it is something that is being
[SPEAKER_01]: reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: Self-reported by patients and it is
looking really substantial.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the only study, but I don't
have time to go over other pain studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another pain study in Canada that
showed a similar result of people dropping
[SPEAKER_01]: opioids and switching to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in the plant, again, we not only have
cannabinoids, different set of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, but we also have terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes are the aromatic lipophilic
molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what gives cannabis a different
smell, a different strain of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: smells differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: One may smell like lemon because it has
limonene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another may smell like lavender because it
has linalool as a terpene in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: These aromatic molecules, they easily
cross blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you inhale terpenes through your
nose, it actually goes into your olfactory
[SPEAKER_01]: system and crosses through the blood-brain
barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not just smell, it actually has
biological and physiological effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we look here, d-limonene is being
used as potent anti-cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Linalool has analgesic, anxiolytic,
and immunostimulant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beta-mercine, which is found in hop and
mango, is potent anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alpha-pinene is a acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor, or SIN, which acts in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: way as Alzheimer's medications do,
which are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
[SPEAKER_01]: for the most part, except for mementine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And linalool has analgesic, anxiolytic,
and anti-inflammatory anti-convulsant
[SPEAKER_01]: properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these molecules are biological and
physiologically active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beta-karyophylline is probably one of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has anti-inflammatory and gastric
cytoprotective activities, as well as it
[SPEAKER_01]: serves as CB2 selective agonist.
[SPEAKER_01]: These terpenes are not just found in
cannabis, and beta-karyophylline is very
[SPEAKER_01]: prominent in hops, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is also very prominent in Lithuanian
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the products, actually, that we have
here made from Lithuanian hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you about them in a minute,
they're loaded naturally with
[SPEAKER_01]: beta-karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are certain strains that will
have a lot of beta-karyophylline,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is CB2 receptor agonist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's involved in immune system
modulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very important to keep that in
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of these different smells,
we have what we call the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, you smell things, and it has a
certain association for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasant association.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe it's something that you should
stay away from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, you estimate your cannabis
flower, especially by smell and by look.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't mean that that's going to
be the physiological effect that it
[SPEAKER_01]: causes, because it all depends on the
components and the molecules that are
[SPEAKER_01]: found in cannabis and their groupings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the names are kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been challenged, Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's out now as Gorilla Glue,
off the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what I find really
interesting, and I think it hurts the
[SPEAKER_01]: market, is when fun names introduced like
Purple Monkey Balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's kind of a wrong
approach, and that's what gives cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry a little bit of a bad rep,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the strain should indicate
something about the condition,
[SPEAKER_01]: something about the feeling, at least in
some way associate with the source,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the location where it was grown,
but not just some crazy name, because a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of younger people would go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it just spoils for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis entourage effect comes from
the sum total of synergistic as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: antagonistic effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, CBD is slightly antagonistic to
THC effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple targets throughout the body are
targeted by a collection of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when terpenes and cannabinoids come
together, they kind of work in unison in
[SPEAKER_01]: one fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They facilitate absorption or delivery of
active ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They counteract or minimize adverse side
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whole plant phyto-cannabinoid extract
compared to phyto-cannabinoid isolates
[SPEAKER_01]: will have a lot of phyto-cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the isolate is just a single
phyto-cannabinoid that has been isolated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, endocannabinoids and cannabinoids are
not just found in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anandamide and oleomide are found in
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should challenge every person that
doesn't know about cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis by telling them, do you know that
you ate cannabinoids today or last night?
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, no, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I have done that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you ate chocolate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You love chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got some cannabinoids in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are very surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truffles also have endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are crazy about certain foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will pay a lot of money for
truffles, a lot of money for chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it all just because of the taste?
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we come to the human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the human body processes this
information in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a multitude of products that
go through the human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's talk about different
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I'm going to jump a couple of
slides, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk about, now that we understand
different components, such as isolates,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as extracts, we want to reconstruct
cannabis into houses, into cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into CBD oil, into protein powder,
into food, and everything that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: has to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's look at these slides and make
sure we understand this, that smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is probably not the best thing,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vaporizing cannabis is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oil ingestion of cannabis, you have
sublingual chewing and swallowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have topical liniments of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also have suppositories.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have very different effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the use of these cannabinoids and
cannabis products will have a very
[SPEAKER_01]: different effect on the individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another important thing to keep in mind
and warn ourselves about is metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC gets metabolized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets metabolized into 11-OH,
Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then through the secondary metabolism,
it turns into Delta 9 THC, 11-Oic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: This 11-Oic acid has nothing to do with
the acidic cannabinoids that are found in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this 11-Oic acid is actually a more
stronger intoxicant than THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why people have problems with
edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're used to inhaling or smoking
cannabis and getting the effect from it
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately, they expect the same when
they try their first edible outside the
[SPEAKER_01]: airport in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And half an hour later, they say,
well, I'm not feeling anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: so let me pop a couple more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time they pop a couple more,
this 11-Oic acid is already built up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is now acting as a double or triple
intoxicant on top of the new THC coming
[SPEAKER_01]: into your body with additional gummy bear
candies that you consumed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's very important to keep in mind
that the metabolism of the body is very
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other way that we view cannabis is
mostly we talk about medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that cannabis and cannabinoids
will find their way into the food chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll find their way into the plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And microdosing of cannabis can be found
in the feed and that animal feed,
[SPEAKER_01]: and through the whole process,
it can find itself in our food supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain on our tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, to reconstruct cannabis,
we have to understand and reconstruct the
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to understand the state of the
endocannabinoid system, metabolic profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: psychological state, drug and drug
interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to create products and then know
that recommending these products,
[SPEAKER_01]: the doctors go by start low, go slow
philosophy, that you have to know dosages,
[SPEAKER_01]: safety, efficacy, pollutants that are
present there, undoubtedly third party
[SPEAKER_01]: test results and clinical studies before
these products can find their way into
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors, nurses, healthcare practitioners
and be recommended either as food
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement or medical cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these are very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we also have to know that there are
contraindications.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cannabis, again, is not for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Psychosis, use of strains with minimal or
no THC content is recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bipolar disease, there's an
association between cannabis misuse and
[SPEAKER_01]: early onset of bipolar.
[SPEAKER_01]: 8% of general population is cannabis
allergic and there is a multitude of drug
[SPEAKER_01]: and drug interactions that happen through
metabolism with cytochrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is metabolism of anti-epileptic drugs
that is taken from Project CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's basically what these lines are
showing that if you combine any one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these bars, any one of these drugs with
CBD, the amount of that pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: drug in the blood can mostly increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases it will decrease,
but in many cases it will increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important to know because
you're essentially by occupying the
[SPEAKER_01]: cytochrome P which metabolizes CBD and
gives CBD priority now does not metabolize
[SPEAKER_01]: the pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore there is a buildup of
pharmaceutical substances in the body that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be twice, three times the
concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Concentrations can lead to serious
problems, liver problems, liver
[SPEAKER_01]: compromise, as well as other effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now cannabis, of course, we have different
preparations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way to consume cannabis through
inhaling is vaporization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's controlled temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis flower vapor pen can be used for
vaporization, concentrate, oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: or wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vaporization is often preferred and that's
because trichomes that contain the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and the terpenes that I told
you, they will melt away before the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: matter or the leaves and the buds will
burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is less carbon monoxide heat and
there is no smoke and somebody will say,
[SPEAKER_01]: why would you ever want to inhale
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me ask you this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we have the most surface area to
absorb things into our bodies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second place is suppositories,
anal and vaginal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bypass the metabolism of the liver
they get absorbed directly through the
[SPEAKER_01]: lungs into the bloodstream or into the
bloodstream through the suppositories and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're immediately into the blood where
they can cause blood-brain barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore inhaling something can be very
helpful for people that suffer from
[SPEAKER_01]: certain conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have to understand that there are
isolates that look like powder and it will
[SPEAKER_01]: almost look like a synthetic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is actually an isolate from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what a lot of people ask me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is isolate the same as synthetic
cannabinoids where you take and mix things
[SPEAKER_01]: together and then you get this powder?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's processing of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extracting the plant, separating the
molecules where you can get an isolate
[SPEAKER_01]: such as CBD or THC isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the products are raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that they're non-decarboxylated
and they will contain acidic cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and many products have been
decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to pay attention to these
raw products or they have been
[SPEAKER_01]: decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting a different profile of the
cannabinoids in these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many oils that are being produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the tinctures though, what you
refer to tinctures with alcohol,
[SPEAKER_01]: but many oils are being used as carriers
for either isolates or for the extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves such as olive oil, coconut oil,
hemp seed oil, and glycerin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as well there is form of capsules that
can be found.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many different products, many different
uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to know the test results.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to know what is inside the
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to know where they're sourced,
where they came from, how they were made,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how they found their way on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us to have individualized
cannabinoid preparations, which I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: really necessary, they have to be
individualized for a certain condition and
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to be individualized for a
certain individual because that individual
[SPEAKER_01]: with a certain condition may be taking
different drugs, may be having a different
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolic turnover.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to standardize the grows and
the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: To standardize the grows, the biggest
challenge is you have to have complete
[SPEAKER_01]: control of inputs that is going into the
plant and complete control of outputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to scan the plant, measure the
plant, so that you can capture the same
[SPEAKER_01]: output, chemical output of the plant cycle
after cycle, which is a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: To my knowledge, nobody has done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I am wrong, please correct me,
but there is no standardized output from
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same strain grown by the same grower,
the same conditions, the two grows,
[SPEAKER_01]: 40% in the composition of terpenes,
especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes are evolved by stress,
so it's a natural way for the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: protect itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And terpenes and cannabinoids,
they fluctuate during the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to capture the part of
the cycle and the part of doubt that is
[SPEAKER_01]: standardized what you saw in your previous
growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you have the standardized grow and
standardized plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have to standardize the products,
make sure that the products are always the
[SPEAKER_01]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to then analyze databases and
ensure that you trace the patients that
[SPEAKER_01]: are using, are they getting good effects
or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So analyzing databases are going to be
very important, gathering that
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to pay attention to liver
metabolism and compromise of liver
[SPEAKER_01]: function.
[SPEAKER_01]: High levels of CBD can compromise liver
function.
[SPEAKER_01]: Milligrams of CBD taken together with some
of these anti-epileptic drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Warfarin, for example, will increase also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blood thinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we have to think about a lot of
drugs that we're using essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So liver metabolism is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then drug and drug interactions as the
liver metabolizes these is also very
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my opinion, science anything goes in
science and you can really pave the way of
[SPEAKER_01]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have bright ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can dive in the deepest oceans or look
at the highest mountains to find and pave
[SPEAKER_01]: the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a fact and these facts need
to be taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry needs education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry needs a lot of education.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the biggest bottleneck in
Germany right now is the healthcare
[SPEAKER_01]: practitioners and medical doctors because
they do not understand the products that
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not understand why certain strains
should be used over another certain
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why maybe low THC should be recommended
for somebody that has inclinations or
[SPEAKER_01]: indications of psychosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there has to be a major
destigmatization of cannabis which can
[SPEAKER_01]: only happen through education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course in medicine, to reach that
medical point, we need to standardize the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannesuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannesuticals are different from
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a paradigm change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all have to get used to the reality
and how to interpret this paradigm change
[SPEAKER_01]: in the existing systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hemp cannabis saves lives and heals
people and animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you waiting for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course most of you here know what
you're waiting for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are other people waiting for?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are other politicians waiting for?
[SPEAKER_01]: The facts are in front of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reality is in front of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I wanted to say is meetings like this
are really great because last year when we
[SPEAKER_01]: were at this meeting, we came together
with people that came from different parts
[SPEAKER_01]: of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met outside the meeting and we met
inside the meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to tell you that fruition of
this meeting last year ago is a new brand
[SPEAKER_01]: that our company Meditaurus is launching.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Florans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you stop by, you can see the
variety of products that we produce with
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp-based CBD in the United States as
well as in Lithuania in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these meetings and Alex organizing
these meetings and all of the guys and the
[SPEAKER_01]: ladies promoting the networking is really
valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very happy to be here again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I'm here because we formed a
strong partnership.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also nice when you find the right
people and the right partners where you
[SPEAKER_01]: can move things forward in the desired
fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are our partners for Florans
Meditaurus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you very much for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time, Dr. Jay Z.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have time maybe for one question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if it's a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe closer to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Jay Z, why do some people not feel CBD
immediately?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've come across a way right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it about people that they require
different dosages?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know you as the person that asks the
toughest questions in the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is perhaps my answer would be,
what are you supposed to feel with CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people are used to feeling
intoxicating effect with THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first few times they take it and
there's a certain feeling, maybe I should
[SPEAKER_01]: be feeling something like high or
intoxicated, but that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have no problems, if you have
no anxiety, if you have no pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have no nausea, acid reflux or
gastric problems, you may not feel that
[SPEAKER_01]: effect of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly enough, the doctors in the
United States are now suggesting
[SPEAKER_01]: prophylactic use of CBD every day of about
three to five milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, for what reason?
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially to tame the increase in
inflammation and the aging that happens
[SPEAKER_01]: just normally in our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry I don't have a definitive answer
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, it definitely probably
has to do with metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people might metabolize it much
faster so they need higher doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I had a similar question where
somebody asked me, when I smoke THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I smoke so much of it and I smoke a
concentrate and still can't get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I said, well, did you ever get
high?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, oh yeah, I had these
edibles and knocked me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it occurred to me that maybe the
receptor that that lady had is not
[SPEAKER_01]: properly structured.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC doesn't bind to that receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 11-oic-THC acid, the secondary
metabolite of liver, now has a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: intoxicating effect on the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time, Dr. Jay-Z.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he'd be happy to answer more
questions in the hallway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure we're out of time.
