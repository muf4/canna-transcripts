[SPEAKER_05]: How's everyone doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, if we could all do that now.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's spectacular.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just wait for the room to couple more
seconds here and we'll create a little
[SPEAKER_05]: environment to talk about international
and commerce.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're probably noticing that our
panel's a little bare than anticipated.
[SPEAKER_05]: With me on my immediate left is Andrew
Miroff and on my right is Linus Weber.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Robert Lorry and well we were missing
Mr. Tom Zuber and who I'm told had some
[SPEAKER_05]: flight complications and Clint Young
unfortunately is really under the weather.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we thought we would do given that
there's just three of us, our panel
[SPEAKER_05]: discussion is really more going to be I
would call it a fireside chat and we
[SPEAKER_05]: should have enough room for questions and
with that I think we'll kick it off.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Canada, as we all know, has been the
world leader in international cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: market being that it's the first G7
country to federally create a regime
[SPEAKER_05]: devoted to legalization but competition is
certainly ramping up as other countries
[SPEAKER_05]: legalize and we're seeing a whole bunch of
different models.
[SPEAKER_05]: From Uruguay, Israel, the Netherlands,
Germany, Australia, I could go on,
[SPEAKER_05]: Thailand, every day there seems to be
another country either decriminalizing,
[SPEAKER_05]: legalizing or introducing some form of
regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that being said, why don't we
just take a moment, you two, well we'll
[SPEAKER_05]: start with Mr. Miroff, introduce yourself
and just take us through, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: your involvement with international
cannabis and then we'll hear from Linus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Glad to be on the stage with both of you
and the other guys missed out so they're
[SPEAKER_04]: lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Andrew and I'm the CEO of
Strain Print Technologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We capture patient reported outcomes from
medical cannabis patients who are treating
[SPEAKER_04]: with legal product mainly and we deliver
that anonymous data back to the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the largest data set of its kind
in the world today, over 1.4 million
[SPEAKER_04]: patient reported outcomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're Toronto-based, we're a Canadian
company and we service today Canada,
[SPEAKER_04]: the US, Israel and hopefully soon in the
European Union.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Linus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name's Linus, I'm from Germany,
founder and CEO of Nimbus Health,
[SPEAKER_03]: a fully licensed pharmaceutical
wholesaler.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been in the business since July
only, started two years ago sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: starting building up the connections to
producers outside the European Union,
[SPEAKER_03]: now also inside European, a very keen to
see how the market especially in the
[SPEAKER_03]: European Union evolves now as more and
more producers coming in but of course
[SPEAKER_03]: challenges are rising also on the Canadian
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see how the US are moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I can tell, the domestic supply
in Germany is not enough, at least for the
[SPEAKER_03]: next four years so we are heavily reliant
on you producing and importing together
[SPEAKER_03]: with us hopefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, those are both great answers
and certainly give us a platform to build
[SPEAKER_05]: on.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I indicated earlier, my name is Robert
Lorry and by trade I'm an international
[SPEAKER_05]: lawyer, I'm licensed in England and Wales
and here in British Columbia and I studied
[SPEAKER_05]: law at Oxford and my previous life I was a
securities fraud lawyer and hedge fund
[SPEAKER_05]: formation lawyer which developed a great
understanding of onshore, offshore tax
[SPEAKER_05]: arbitrage and that's effectively what
we're starting to see more and more are
[SPEAKER_05]: companies that are structuring their
operations in manners which are tax
[SPEAKER_05]: efficient and I would like to I guess put
out to both of you the question as what is
[SPEAKER_05]: driving your respective businesses?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it following Canada as an example or is
it other considerations such as tax
[SPEAKER_05]: deficiencies?
[SPEAKER_05]: Wondering if you might be able to comment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start with Linus this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well basically if you look at the history
for Germany in 1998 we had strona binol
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a purely THC compound which was
sort of given to patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since 2003 we have flowers already from
the Netherlands so there has been already
[SPEAKER_03]: a market for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: However in 2017 it became possible to
reimburse medicinal cannabis by the health
[SPEAKER_03]: insurance of the people in Germany and
this will sort of the game changer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're now ramping up in the last two and a
half years it's only 70,000 patients but
[SPEAKER_03]: this is due to the fact that we don't have
the education of the doctors so sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: copying on the one side from the medicinal
space we are basically as an experiment in
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe from everyone so a little bit from
Canada in the United States and so on and
[SPEAKER_03]: so forth but in the end we need more
doctors education and this is something we
[SPEAKER_03]: should start copying more efficiently sort
of opening up the world of cannabis to our
[SPEAKER_03]: doctors in Germany to be able to sort of
bring more patients in because we have
[SPEAKER_03]: 70,000 patients and I think the potential
is between 800,000 and 1.6 million because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's roughly one to two percent of the
population of Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew?
[SPEAKER_04]: We track patient performance against lab
verified product and in most jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't have even a testing requirement
today so the key to us understanding the
[SPEAKER_04]: science behind what works and what doesn't
is to be able to identify which chemical
[SPEAKER_04]: constituents are are correlated to what
symptomatic improvement and drilling down
[SPEAKER_04]: by cohort by age by gender and being able
to see that 35 year old women react to
[SPEAKER_04]: certain chemical profiles different than
50 year old men for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we think about other jurisdictions
where the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: is a good example every state is an island
every state has its own regulatory regime
[SPEAKER_04]: for how they both how they grow as well as
how they test so for me it's about taking
[SPEAKER_04]: the experiences from Canada with lab
verified products and the data that's
[SPEAKER_04]: related to those lab verified products and
translating that into foreign markets
[SPEAKER_04]: where we haven't actually tested local
product there but we know that the
[SPEAKER_04]: chemical profile aligns to personality so
even in Europe today there's as we know
[SPEAKER_04]: there's very little product there so we
have an opportunity right now to take what
[SPEAKER_04]: we know and we've had the fortune to do
that here in Canada only because the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations are the way they are so I
think we actually from my perspective we
[SPEAKER_04]: had a great advantage here that the regs
were so tight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well an avenue that you may not think
about that certainly should come to mind
[SPEAKER_05]: in the discussion of international is
certainly First Nations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now at the moment as C45 the Cannabis Act
stands there is no information or guidance
[SPEAKER_05]: as to how First Nations should be setting
up legal cannabis operations.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to remember that First Nations are
also technically a fourth level of
[SPEAKER_05]: government and recently I was made a board
member on the Zagame Asinebek First
[SPEAKER_05]: Nations cannabis board which you starting
to see First Nations understanding that
[SPEAKER_05]: through their own process of
self-determination provided they are then
[SPEAKER_05]: endorsed by banned and banned council they
then are able to create infrastructure
[SPEAKER_05]: such as a cannabis board on their land and
begin to engage in this process but I have
[SPEAKER_05]: always thought that that could go a step
further depending on the band again
[SPEAKER_05]: depending on the nation if it's a J treaty
band and again that goes back to the late
[SPEAKER_05]: 1850s or so which was a recognition of by
the US Canadian and British governments of
[SPEAKER_05]: the First Nations that were in existence
at that time and the stipulation was to
[SPEAKER_05]: recognize the free movement of people in
goods and I think well what I know is
[SPEAKER_05]: coming is that you're going to see a lot
more First Nations exercising their
[SPEAKER_05]: self-determination in some form or another
to realize a tax efficiency and I started
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at this like six seven years ago
and my first legal aid case in Haida Gwaii
[SPEAKER_05]: I was up there and they're talking about
you know getting into the wine trade and I
[SPEAKER_05]: was like have you seen the wind it's a
hundred and eighty like miles an hour
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to be harvesting grapes and
Prince Rupert what about cannabis because
[SPEAKER_05]: ultimately I looked at it is Haida Gwaii
could very much be the Bermuda or the
[SPEAKER_05]: Bahamas of British Columbia with respect
to an onshore offshore arbitrage so that I
[SPEAKER_05]: think we're going to see across the United
States First Nations engaging in
[SPEAKER_05]: self-determination which could lead to
international deals with the European
[SPEAKER_05]: market and with certainly cross-border
what are your thoughts on that I think
[SPEAKER_04]: it's couldn't happen soon enough I mean we
there's a massive opportunity in
[SPEAKER_04]: production and a massive opportunity in
export once a level of compliance is
[SPEAKER_04]: reached I think that's the big king right
now is bringing production facilities on
[SPEAKER_04]: those lands up to the same level that are
in and that's not to say it can't be done
[SPEAKER_04]: of course it can be done it's just is it a
priority right now and it hasn't been up
[SPEAKER_04]: until now but it will be and there is a
lot of opportunity for product to cross
[SPEAKER_04]: borders that don't have the same level of
export regulation that say any of any of
[SPEAKER_04]: the big producers here today have right on
any thoughts yes it's a European
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective on First Nations exactly I
mean we have from a from a European
[SPEAKER_03]: standpoint and that's basically the word
everybody heard of is the UGMP
[SPEAKER_03]: certification process and Nick did it in
his in his speech that there's like a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: effort to really reach that kind of
certification we are engaging in that I
[SPEAKER_03]: think they need to be clear standard ways
of how to produce medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the world and this can only be
done through collaboration and I see that
[SPEAKER_03]: this really urge for collaboration in
cannabis is there I mean my background is
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer there wasn't like everybody was
working in their little offices and now
[SPEAKER_03]: with Kenneth we have the possibility to
really do that collaborative work in order
[SPEAKER_03]: to find really standards that would ease
the export and ease also any processes in
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of bringing products either from
Canada to other jurisdictions or also into
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada I would say I mean domestic supply
in Germany is not enough but others will
[SPEAKER_03]: be ramping up so there must be some kind
of standardization in the process yeah and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what I think is the big challenge
in the near future well given there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of products going from A to B and C
and D and back to a probably how are the
[SPEAKER_05]: products getting to their destinations
I'll just go ahead now I give an anecdote
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I I have BC product that I bought
that got delivered to me in Ontario and I
[SPEAKER_04]: brought it back to BC you know products
are getting transported in a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: different ways and I think there's there
are both logistical issues but there are
[SPEAKER_04]: regulatory issues I don't I don't even
know how we're ever going to get into the
[SPEAKER_04]: US in the near future because it's it's
very exclusionary for lack of a better
[SPEAKER_04]: word I think it's a short-term problem but
it is what it is right now so I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: think the US market is gonna be but how do
we get products into the UK we're just
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about this earlier or into the EU
if you can get into the market is it
[SPEAKER_04]: transported by air is it transported by
ship is it transported by rail and we know
[SPEAKER_04]: that they have a prevalence for for rail
so I'm just a data guy but I'm just
[SPEAKER_05]: speaking observationally on what I see so
Linus you get somehow this product comes
[SPEAKER_05]: from the Netherlands makes its way to
Germany do you want to take us through
[SPEAKER_03]: that exactly and we actually are using a
normal transporters bringing in from from
[SPEAKER_03]: from Betra Khan basically everybody knows
that come they're doing standardized
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal cannabis products out of the
Netherlands that's those are the ones
[SPEAKER_03]: which we are currently distributing in
Germany we are in discussion with several
[SPEAKER_03]: Canadian companies already but then this
EU GMP certification comes in where it
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes gets really difficult but we now
have a GMP professional in our team really
[SPEAKER_03]: helps the companies to sort of ease that
process but I must admit of course it's
[SPEAKER_03]: from coming from Canada it's always by
plane and we had the first plane arriving
[SPEAKER_03]: from Tilray in Germany last week from
Portugal so there are new countries coming
[SPEAKER_03]: in where we can build relationships also
in inside the European Union which makes
[SPEAKER_03]: which makes it a little bit easier but I
mean there are products coming in and
[SPEAKER_03]: there are possibilities and we are more
than happy to help you understand what is
[SPEAKER_03]: needed to bring products to the German
market slash the European market because
[SPEAKER_03]: once it's in the European Union it's way
easier of course distributing it to other
[SPEAKER_03]: countries such as for example Spain Italy
Portugal also but Portugal is now has a
[SPEAKER_03]: huge domestic growth I don't think there
is export needed to Portugal so can I ask
[SPEAKER_04]: a question to get it into the EU it's the
same regardless of whether or not it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: end is going into Germany or going into
Switzerland or yet it's not as easy as
[SPEAKER_03]: that so of course it's once you're inside
the European Union it's it is easier to
[SPEAKER_03]: have the export license as a European
company to export to a different
[SPEAKER_03]: jurisdiction within the European Union
that's what's easier because it's already
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah checked by a qualified person which
is also in our team and then it's also
[SPEAKER_03]: medical approved in Germany which makes it
easier to distribute to any other the
[SPEAKER_03]: other way around it's a bit more difficult
because the Germans always looking very
[SPEAKER_03]: deeply into the processes and a check if
everything is all right but the other way
[SPEAKER_04]: around it's it's more easy so if you're
Canadian you'd look for the easiest
[SPEAKER_04]: jurisdiction in the EU to get into and
then from there you transfer it into
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany it's an obvious market so I want
to engage the audience just indulge me for
[SPEAKER_05]: one second you've been a great audience
here with a yay or a nay I'd like an
[SPEAKER_05]: honest answer we'll see who's louder I
guess Canada cannabis regulations are they
[SPEAKER_05]: over regulated okay good so we can
continue because if it went the other way
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I could have asked the next
question given that Canada had first mover
[SPEAKER_05]: advantage and has created a system that
the rest of the world has been watching
[SPEAKER_05]: some have even been adopting and applying
but do you feel that the standard in
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada has set itself too high that would
be very hard for the government to come
[SPEAKER_05]: down to be competitive so I guess the
question is has Canada in a way by being
[SPEAKER_05]: so cautious out of the gate has it
kneecapped itself with respect to being
[SPEAKER_04]: truly competitive I think it's I think
it's actually been a boon for us because
[SPEAKER_04]: by setting the regulation so high it's
forced us to come to the table with real
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical type production facilities
and really high quality product that no
[SPEAKER_04]: other jurisdiction would accept if we
weren't at that date so I kind of look at
[SPEAKER_04]: it the other way if we were if we were
like the US where the the lens is really
[SPEAKER_04]: about commercialization and not about
public safety I don't think a country like
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany would even consider bringing it in
without the type of testing and experience
[SPEAKER_04]: level that we've had over this and
remember we started out the only reason
[SPEAKER_04]: why we're able to have that jump start
into the European Union as an example is
[SPEAKER_04]: because we had a medical program has
nothing to do with the recreational
[SPEAKER_04]: program and the only reason we're able to
go into foreign markets today is because
[SPEAKER_04]: of the medical program so I don't think
having a tight regs around the
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational program is is going to be a
limitation and I also think that it was
[SPEAKER_04]: way easier for the government in Canada to
loosen the reins than it is for for
[SPEAKER_05]: instance in the US that's if they get
voted back in what's that that's if they
[SPEAKER_03]: get voted back in yeah I mean from a
German perspective I think there can I can
[SPEAKER_03]: tell if Canada is over regulated my first
time here but basically what we see is a
[SPEAKER_03]: German would always do something rather
not than doing it wrong and that's why
[SPEAKER_03]: they are very cautious and careful by sort
of importing products into Germany and
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody knows really how to do it right
every local authority needs to do that
[SPEAKER_03]: import license for the respective
producers base of respective distributors
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is also based on the place where
you're located in Germany for example I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: from Hessen Frankfurt and we have three
authorities which are sort of overlooking
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole process we have a narcotic and
narcotic agency would then in the end
[SPEAKER_03]: decides what is done so we have of course
huge regulations as well but it's sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: the processes are getting easier because
they've been done a couple of times now
[SPEAKER_03]: and yeah as I said we are more than happy
to assist I think as Nick said earlier we
[SPEAKER_03]: you should always go with a with a good
GMP consultant in order to be able to sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of overlook what is needed before you end
up having huge cost and will not be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to bring products in hey before we go to
questions is there anything in particular
[SPEAKER_05]: that we haven't covered that either of
you'd like to share about the uniqueness
[SPEAKER_05]: of being ahead of the curve if you will
with your business and be happy to learn
[SPEAKER_04]: more about this we were fortunate to be
gathering data in 2016 so we had a pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: big head start in doing it now we still
have to deal with as we go into
[SPEAKER_04]: international markets we still have to
deal with jurisdictional transfer of data
[SPEAKER_04]: across borders so going into Europe for
example we we have to be GNV GDP are
[SPEAKER_04]: compliant which is the privacy regulation
in that market and if if you will in the u
[SPEAKER_04]: .s.
[SPEAKER_04]: there's HIPAA compliance that's if we
consider right here Canadian compliance is
[SPEAKER_04]: PIP it on its basically level compliance
is here and GDPR is way up here so it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: big step up and and for us having a first
mover advantage of gathering data and
[SPEAKER_04]: being cloud-based and only keeping and
data only residing in Canada never leaving
[SPEAKER_04]: the country on servers here as we go into
the UK or into Germany or anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_04]: in the EU we have to be GDPR compliant and
we are now so we're almost are now
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting right on okay Linus I think
data is a it's a it's a big big point and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's where the game is changing and I
hope you're right and when Israel also
[SPEAKER_03]: coming in I think we had it already early
in the conference where somebody was
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about Israel how much data they're
gathering they're doing it for 20 years I
[SPEAKER_03]: think this is really really something what
is important and needed and I said it
[SPEAKER_03]: already in the beginning collaboration is
the key I would say combining different
[SPEAKER_03]: jurisdictions see what what works do
experiments I mean Germany is the
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment for Europe in terms of the
patient numbers and sort of inserting
[SPEAKER_03]: inserting products from all over the all
over the world so yeah I see I see data is
[SPEAKER_03]: key and we should be exchanging more more
of the data and yeah I'm looking forward
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe working more closely with you in the
future okay yes or no answer to this
[SPEAKER_05]: question and then we'll open it up to
questions the cannabis production yes or
[SPEAKER_05]: no is it a race to the bottom making me
put me on the spot without he's gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: answer to that yeah I mean sadly the
reality is it is right now I think it'll
[SPEAKER_04]: stabilize at some point but you know at
this point every producer can sell
[SPEAKER_04]: everything that they grow there's just so
much demand at some point there'll be
[SPEAKER_04]: enough supply to service the market and I
don't know when that is but at some point
[SPEAKER_04]: there'll be enough supply to service the
market and companies are gonna have to
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out how to differentiate their
products from others and it's a very hard
[SPEAKER_04]: mark I'm an IP lawyer so it's very
difficult to actually protect particular
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivar because somebody can just come up
with a formulation that's slightly
[SPEAKER_03]: different and it's no longer covered sir
the same question yes and just for an
[SPEAKER_03]: example for Germany in 2018 we had 3.1
tons of cannabis flower material which was
[SPEAKER_03]: just reviewed this year we are probably at
five to six next year it's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: again doubled let's say 12 tons for whole
of Germany and if I just see what amounts
[SPEAKER_03]: are currently grown there will be a huge
and I'm not afraid but it will be a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: challenge to sort of differentiate the
different products but let's look at
[SPEAKER_03]: Greece where there's the weather a hundred
tons grown another Spain coming in
[SPEAKER_03]: Portugal Canada is there nobody knows
what's going to happen with the with the
[SPEAKER_03]: US in short notice so yeah it's going to
be a huge challenge in terms also of the
[SPEAKER_03]: pricing and competitiveness because there
are also Eastern European countries coming
[SPEAKER_03]: in North Macedonia Poland which are
produced at really really low cost so
[SPEAKER_03]: let's see how it turns out I don't have a
request answer to that question but yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: German yes and no it's every technical
okay there any folks let's hear for the
[SPEAKER_06]: panel first of all right away I have a
quick question first you mentioned IP as
[SPEAKER_06]: in respect to cannabis strains how is it
even possible how do you how do you patent
[SPEAKER_06]: trainwreck how do you patent bubble kush
how do you patent blue dream like I mean
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis have been with the longest time
and it's just it's weird to me to see
[SPEAKER_04]: people try to if anybody's ever done a
patent before you know it's there there's
[SPEAKER_04]: a there's a long process to it it's yours
and it costs a lot of money and not
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody can afford to patent a strain
and if you were to take a particular if
[SPEAKER_04]: you went through the effort to genetically
test your product and and that means
[SPEAKER_04]: beyond just you know CBD and THC but if
you actually go through the effort and
[SPEAKER_04]: look at the full chemical profile and you
patent that that's great you're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: spend fifteen twenty five thousand dollars
on that it'll take a couple years and then
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody's gonna change the formulation by
slightly one slight different amount and
[SPEAKER_04]: then you're no longer covered so I don't
think it's patentable hi I hear you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: talking what about the Caribbean market
because I know a lot you guys and
[SPEAKER_07]: Caribbean right now but I hear you mention
nothing about the Caribbean market well I
[SPEAKER_05]: also think the Antarctica market has
potential but we can't discuss everything
[SPEAKER_05]: to answer your question so I think that's
a huge market and unfortunately none of us
[SPEAKER_05]: are technically working in that
jurisdiction there are a lot of guys in
[SPEAKER_05]: the region right now oh I have a number of
people in this room I know who are working
[SPEAKER_05]: in Jamaica right now but I've never been
there and but I will say this is that the
[SPEAKER_05]: Caribbean has a huge role to play in the
cannabis industry because it will allow a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of companies to do what's called
they'll be eligible for something called a
[SPEAKER_05]: Citizens Investment Bureau passport
program meaning that if you show up in
[SPEAKER_05]: Antigua Barbuda and say hi government like
to give you our IP I'd also like to talk
[SPEAKER_05]: to you about a distribution agreement and
in return we're now eligible for your
[SPEAKER_05]: Citizens Investment Bureau passport scheme
I was happy but the point I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: make is is yes you're going to see a lot
of places that use the Caribbean for
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis just like they're going to use
the Caribbean for banking services which
[SPEAKER_05]: means it's going to be a very central hub
either way thank you all right over here
[SPEAKER_01]: you're welcome I had a question about
strategic partner I had a question about
[SPEAKER_01]: strategic partnerships so you kind of
mentioned the tribes I had submitted a
[SPEAKER_01]: tokenized a tribal tokenized asset in
California with the collateral being a
[SPEAKER_01]: blunt rolling machine with the idea of
combining tobacco and cannabis they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: like the idea maybe it was too soon and so
I'm curious about your opinions in
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing Native American tribes in North
America and combining cannabis with you
[SPEAKER_01]: know tobacco so an eventuality that's
normalized professionalized you guys see
[SPEAKER_01]: that as being an option I know that
Germany's probably never going to allow
[SPEAKER_01]: that but it's popular with splits but do
you guys see blunts you know tobacco and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis eventually being combined
together there's a massive tobacco
[SPEAKER_04]: production facility on Six Nations and in
Hamilton outside of Toronto and if you've
[SPEAKER_04]: ever been there it's one of the largest
productions tobacco production facilities
[SPEAKER_04]: in the world and I don't think I don't
think there's much interest in combining
[SPEAKER_04]: tobacco and cannabis in a product but
there is definitely interest in utilizing
[SPEAKER_04]: their infrastructure to produce cannabis
to be exported and yes cannabis is an
[SPEAKER_05]: excuse me tobacco at least in the Supreme
Court cases with First Nations have
[SPEAKER_05]: recognized a very general right to the
possession of tobacco for commercial
[SPEAKER_05]: purposes if you guys Vander Pete I think
was the Supreme Court case where a guy
[SPEAKER_05]: been stockpiling tobacco clearly he was
going to sell it but that was something
[SPEAKER_05]: that First Nations we have to remember
we're doing since time of memoriam before
[SPEAKER_05]: Europeans showing up so it would that that
type of a scenario fought very nice or fit
[SPEAKER_05]: very nicely within the existing
jurisprudence and that's why I think
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis isn't really a too big of a
stone's throw from tobacco and in fact
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just one of many natural medicines
and you know from the work that we've been
[SPEAKER_05]: doing more of the bands are wanting to not
just take on cannabis but they want
[SPEAKER_05]: psilocybin you know the fungi peyote
through the cacti vines ayahuasca DMT with
[SPEAKER_05]: chacruna all of these natural practices
that I think they will be able to do a
[SPEAKER_05]: whole host of commercial endeavors under
food social and ceremonial but thank you
[SPEAKER_03]: for your question yeah now it's currently
done in in Germany to buy there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: possibility because no one cannabis
patient is smoking cannabis in Germany no
[SPEAKER_03]: basically what we have is vaporizing
option or tea option those are the things
[SPEAKER_03]: which are actively known as application
methods and this is a huge problem most of
[SPEAKER_03]: the doctors have because if they giving
medicinal cannabis flowers to a patient
[SPEAKER_03]: they always have the risk that they are
smoking it giving to their grandchildren
[SPEAKER_03]: or something like that so there's no
option but from a scientific point of view
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there is a yeah it might be a
possibility to use also the tobacco plant
[SPEAKER_03]: to find solutions of for example also
creating cannabinoids but that's a very
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting talk we should do maybe
afterwards hello hello questions my name
[SPEAKER_02]: is Phil Hardy director of sales with a
craft depot and we're currently contracted
[SPEAKER_02]: by 50 LPs to help with wholesale
distribution and creating efficiencies and
[SPEAKER_02]: transparency in that market LP to LP my
question is specifically for Linus and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's concerning importing into Germany or
importing into the EU I've heard variants
[SPEAKER_02]: of what's acceptable and what's not from a
GPP standpoint so if you have a cultivator
[SPEAKER_02]: who's GPP compliant and is is doing their
post-harvest in a GPP level can they go
[SPEAKER_02]: into the EU GMP because I've understood
that this GACP and then once they harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: has to go into a GMP process so I'm trying
to get some clarity because I hear people
[SPEAKER_02]: saying it was GPP all the way till it's
packaged in kilos it can move overseas and
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard folks that say no it has to be
GACP at harvest you cut her down move it
[SPEAKER_02]: into GMP for your curing drying and and
packaging and then that can move into the
[SPEAKER_03]: EU can you speak to that a little bit yeah
it should I mean there are a lot of things
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of rumors coming around GACP is it
possible or not currently there is no GACP
[SPEAKER_03]: grown product in the German market so what
you need is an EU GMP certified facility
[SPEAKER_03]: the best would be by a by a German
authority currently waiting times are year
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 month at least at our authority where
we are working with then you're you're
[SPEAKER_03]: safe and can sort of distribute also
prepackaged medicinal cannabis products
[SPEAKER_03]: and then all the qualification and the
medical approval will be done inside
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany the products will be then get an
additional label on it and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: distribute in Germany that's the easiest
way there are now things discussed if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: possible to sort of grow GACP certified
products have them extracted as an at an
[SPEAKER_03]: EU GMP certified facility packaged labeled
and then sent to Germany but it's not yet
[SPEAKER_03]: possible but this is I think a feasible
solution because GACP is easy and I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: think everything needs to be grown indoors
greenhouses is an alternative which is
[SPEAKER_02]: also used in Israel for example thank you
very much so then just for further
[SPEAKER_02]: clarification as well a GPP cultivator
just with the cultivation license who then
[SPEAKER_02]: sells to an EU GMP certified processor who
then creates those products and then they
[SPEAKER_02]: can export is that a possibility is that a
supply chain that works as I said every
[SPEAKER_03]: process so every process every supply
chain is tested itself so for example if
[SPEAKER_03]: we are now coming together and you give me
an an overview of the product you would
[SPEAKER_03]: like to import I have to get that import
license based on those products exactly on
[SPEAKER_03]: all the information all the lab tests you
have what we do is we usually do a sample
[SPEAKER_03]: shipment have it tested in Germany and
directly yeah burned basically disposed
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we sort of test all the processor
because German authorities feel way more
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable if they are tested by a German
lab and have been tested by a qualified
[SPEAKER_03]: person so it always suggests use a
distributor where you have GMP knowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: and who have already done those sample
shipments and understand the process there
[SPEAKER_03]: are a lot of people running around
currently there are 13 licenses readers
[SPEAKER_03]: including us so be careful good talk
question thank you perfect thank you do we
[SPEAKER_06]: have time for one more is that anyone has
a brief one anyone have a short question
[SPEAKER_06]: is that you raising your hand over there
all right here we go what are we good one
[SPEAKER_06]: last question please be brief do not
ramble be right here here we go
[SPEAKER_00]: just a question about Germany and what a
free is doing so a free has a distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: license one of the one of the 14 in
Germany that you spoke of and from my
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding a free is just purchasing
products from Switzerland and getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution revenue for it from a law a
company called blossom and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just getting those companies and
flipping them for pennies on the dollar my
[SPEAKER_00]: question is like what do you think about
that strategy for companies like a free
[SPEAKER_00]: and yourself long-term who are basically
using the distribution network to create
[SPEAKER_03]: revenue and so basically what we've set up
I mean we are solely focused on
[SPEAKER_03]: distribution at the moment we are doing
some scientific work as well with the
[SPEAKER_03]: tobacco for example what where we see
ourselves we see ourselves as an entry
[SPEAKER_03]: gate for Europe we of course can
distribute to the pharmacies we are very
[SPEAKER_03]: well connected to the biggest pharmacies
in the cannabis space we are the only
[SPEAKER_03]: distributor who is part of the network of
cannabis pharmacies in Germany so we think
[SPEAKER_03]: we have a good overview of the market and
sort of know how it's how it's working out
[SPEAKER_03]: currently the process is not that much
regulated that something like this can
[SPEAKER_03]: happen so exporting for example from from
from the Switzerland those are mainly I
[SPEAKER_03]: think also CBD products which are sold in
Germany as aroma oils and it clearly has
[SPEAKER_03]: to say that it's not it should not be
taken orally at any time so what they
[SPEAKER_03]: currently doing for those aroma oils in
CBD is they put it on a on a pillow and
[SPEAKER_03]: then smell it through the pillow that's
that's how it's currently the application
[SPEAKER_03]: method should be of course you can easily
take those products but I mean we have
[SPEAKER_03]: huge problems with the novel food that's a
completely different story so I think it
[SPEAKER_03]: will be too much to answer that question
in this but I'm more than happy to talk
[SPEAKER_06]: afterwards yeah yeah all right all right
thank you so very much let's hear once
[SPEAKER_06]: again for the panel thank you
