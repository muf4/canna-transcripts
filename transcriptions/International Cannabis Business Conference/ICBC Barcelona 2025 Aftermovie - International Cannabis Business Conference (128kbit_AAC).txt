[SPEAKER_01]: This was an excellent event this year,
the culmination of a lot of years journey
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're moving forward in the cannabis
industry in Europe, full force through
[SPEAKER_01]: Berlin and onward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie Pearson from the New Holland Group
and I'm at my favorite conference in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis which is the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to ICBC Berlin at the
end of April in 2025.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we got a chance to
really connect in about this year was the
[SPEAKER_01]: role that the evolution of cannabis
science and cannabis genetics will play
[SPEAKER_01]: for the future of the industry and as we
move forward the future is going to look a
[SPEAKER_01]: little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of what we're doing through these
ICBC events is to cultivate that future to
[SPEAKER_01]: be its most optimized, healthiest,
realest and freest kind of version of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that we can help co-create.
