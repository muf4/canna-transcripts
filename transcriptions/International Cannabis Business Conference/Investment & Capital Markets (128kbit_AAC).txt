[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I have a loud voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me better now?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'm excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those that don't know me, I'm from
Houston, Texas, which is a weird place to
[SPEAKER_04]: be in the cannabis industry, but I've been
following the industry for six years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I came to the first ICBC conference
back in San Francisco and it's a little
[SPEAKER_04]: trivia.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's the only conference I've ever
just attended.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm usually like either speaking or
something to do with the media.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do two things, but they both revolve
around following the industry for
[SPEAKER_04]: investors, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I run 420 Investor, which focuses on
public companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have one that's about to be public
here, so we'll definitely talk about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I also run New Cannabis Ventures,
which covers the whole space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the basic purpose of New Cannabis
Ventures is to keep a pulse on the
[SPEAKER_04]: business side of the industry and help
investors and operators kind of find out
[SPEAKER_04]: what's really going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm glad you're here with us today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have three very different types of
people and companies, and we'll be
[SPEAKER_04]: learning from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot has changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two of these are OG guys that I've known
for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna start from the far right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have Scott VanRixel from Bang.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure everybody's pretty familiar with
Bang.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's been in the industry since 2010
and about to go public, so we're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: hear that perspective of what it's like to
transition from private to public.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have Dean Arbit, who's been in
the industry since 2011, I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't even know this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've known him from the media side and all
of his investments, but he has been
[SPEAKER_04]: involved with a really interesting company
called Wagner DeMass, which is a
[SPEAKER_04]: technology company for pre-rolls and other
things as well, bud.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just met Carly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And pinch hitting, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to point out Jake had a
family emergency.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may be expecting to see Jake Highmark.
[SPEAKER_04]: He couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Aaron also had a family emergency,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're lucky to have Carly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm gonna let everybody start off by
introducing themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Carly is from Garden Society.
[SPEAKER_04]: All three of these folks are from
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I think you're gonna find to be
so interesting is that they're all
[SPEAKER_04]: involved not only necessarily just in the
rest of the country, but really in the
[SPEAKER_04]: rest of the world as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things are changing that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's cool to be big in California,
but there's a whole big world out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're gonna find out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'd like to do is start off with
you, Scott, and then we'll work our way
[SPEAKER_04]: back.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could just talk about what you were
doing before you came into the industry
[SPEAKER_04]: and what you're doing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, what I was doing is kind of how
I ended up in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a chocolate and gelato company in
Albuquerque with my brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a problem with our gelato and a
friend of mine who opened one of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis labs here, Robert Martin,
invited me out as he was opening his lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he took me around, showed me the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a chef, I was dismayed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you add that there was
supposed to be medical products,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that people weren't capable,
is that people weren't making the choice
[SPEAKER_01]: to kind of do things what I saw as right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came out a couple months later,
started bang, and we progressed from there
[SPEAKER_01]: into what I believe to be one of the
leading cannabis brands for finished
[SPEAKER_01]: goods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dean, same question to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Alan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started in 2011.
[SPEAKER_03]: Previously, I was in the media space,
had an exit there, and initially got into
[SPEAKER_03]: the media side of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was an enthusiast as long as I can
remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: But got into the media space, which gave
me a lot of visibility and a lot of color,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a couple years later,
started to actually make investments and
[SPEAKER_03]: embed with companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so actually, at one of the events that
I founded, New West Summit, was where I
[SPEAKER_03]: met Mitchell and Morgan, my partners,
in Wagner DeMoss, which is a very
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, we've patented a pre-roll
platform that allows us to produce in
[SPEAKER_03]: great scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we work with a big public company
in Canada to license that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other interesting thing I do,
so we produce our own, we're our own
[SPEAKER_03]: licensee in California, working with other
brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the retail side, I help run
Bud.com, which right now will be statewide
[SPEAKER_03]: delivery in California sometime in the
second quarter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're also launching an online
store for non-THC goods that we'll be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to ship worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like CBD and merchandise and that type of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carly Warner, same for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Carly Warner with Garden Society,
just like Erin, but a little lower
[SPEAKER_02]: altitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We founded the company in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I entered the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Previously was in wine for 10 years,
which is where I met Erin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really launched Garden Society as a
way to reach women in a market where they
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't being reached and in a way that
they weren't being spoken to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really proud of what we're
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really excited to be working with a
lot of different partners within the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry to make sure that we can help
break that stigma down and make a change.
[SPEAKER_04]: You weren't just in the wine industry,
you was with Constellation Brands,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so I was with Constellation Brands
and actually helped launch Erin's
[SPEAKER_02]: husband's wine brand through that company,
which is how we met.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so now you know a little bit about who
you're going to learn from today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my first question is for both of you on
the right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, like I said, are kind of OGs in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And things are definitely changing right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was wondering if you could share
your perspectives on, compared to five
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago perhaps, how things have changed
in terms of the capital markets and
[SPEAKER_04]: raising capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I kind of spoke about earlier that
the idea of institutional money was
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely unheard of five years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an obvious significant change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the risk factor of people feeling
comfortable now that companies are public,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's more of them, there's more
options, there's more sites like yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: that are providing good information for
people where they're able to make
[SPEAKER_01]: investments without just putting on green
goggles and saying, oh, I'm going to turn
[SPEAKER_01]: a million dollars into $50 million
overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And aside from that is also the maturity
of the companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even our licensing program went from who
you could get to now actively searching
[SPEAKER_01]: out the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's something that
then goes to people feeling more
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mitigation rest is the maturity of the
industry, the maturity of the operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulation has certainly imposed its
mighty will in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at how many operators there were
in California 18 months ago to how many
[SPEAKER_01]: are in place now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dean can certainly attest to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It thinned the herd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's happening across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And California was unique in showing how
that would happen in that it had a very
[SPEAKER_01]: thriving functional industry, a large
scale, with relatively no regulation and
[SPEAKER_01]: then suddenly there was regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you take most of the other
thing, you had black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that influence of regulation allowed
it to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a testament to the
California companies that survive were the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that could adjust quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's a big change and
those companies will be rewarded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dean, you've seen both sides of it as an
investor and in somebody raising capital.
[SPEAKER_04]: How have things changed?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd probably just really echo a lot of
Scott's thoughts there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sophistication level of investors has
just ticked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a big driver there is Canadian
legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: What that's done is it's just exacerbated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's pushed the process along for
even US-based investors who now see
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially missing the bus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then obviously with constant
distillation, you've got now an avenue for
[SPEAKER_03]: institutional money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going north.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still then it sort of matriculates
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just essentially sophistication,
which is ratcheted up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd say that's probably true for both
investors and operators.
[SPEAKER_04]: Carly, I think your company operates
solely in California right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're raising money from investors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm curious, when you have these
conversations, how much pressure are they
[SPEAKER_04]: giving you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or how much do they want to see you guys
go outside of California?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is your philosophy on how to
handle that pressure?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're definitely getting that question
from all investors that we're speaking to
[SPEAKER_02]: in a serious manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: We aren't currently looking to expand
outside of the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is in our future plans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's mandatory.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not getting an immense amount of
pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say to quickly go multi-state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely within the first
couple of conversations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how many calls a week do you guys feel
from Canadian investment bankers?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say Aaron fields most of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're quite a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: How serious they are is questionable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely a few of them have been.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my next question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And someone already hinted at the
constellation investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Altria, Ambev, which is Budweiser,
Constellation, and Molson, they've all
[SPEAKER_04]: made these strategic investments or
partnerships into the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the one hand, it kind of validates the
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the other hand, I think smaller
companies have to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll go in reverse order here.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you view these big strategic
investors coming into the space?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it an opportunity or a threat?
[SPEAKER_04]: What does it make you do differently?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's a lot for all of us
to learn from what they've done and the
[SPEAKER_02]: money that they're bringing in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to be really careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a big reason why we're trying
to scale sustainably right now so that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can be appealing to someone like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a little ways off for us right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it impacting you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it validates the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you're talking about,
look, there's still some money.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some murky issues there as far as
legality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're talking about the borders,
I think it's a testament to the upside in
[SPEAKER_03]: our industry, the fact that blue chip
brands are now seeing that this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: mandatory play.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's absolutely an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's one that operators need
to embrace.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you afraid of this, Scott,
or do you embrace it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think the first round of those
investments were those companies seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we cover the losses that we're seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Southern Wine and Spirits was fairly open
about the fact that in markets where
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is legalized, they experience a
6% to 8% reduction in alcohol sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got to cover that somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the alcohol and tobacco
industry, that first round of investment
[SPEAKER_01]: was A, how do we redeploy money to a
market that we're losing ground to?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And number two is those smaller initial
pushes were, how are our shareholders,
[SPEAKER_01]: and is the market going to respond to us
as a company getting our toes wet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they saw that it was going to work
out well and it was a good thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when you had that second big plops
of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they felt comfortable to dive in as
opposed to touch a toe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we started our company, I've always
believed the end is either going to be one
[SPEAKER_01]: of two things, bought or bullied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would much rather be on the bought
than the bullied.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the cannabis space has to
focus on having products and concepts that
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to appeal to those who might
bully and are more appealing to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you look at vitamin water as a
perfect example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coca-Cola very easily could have developed
a vitamin water on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was far more efficient for them to just
buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's a small handful of
cannabis companies 20 years from now that
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be still standalone,
unacquired.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that'll be a rarity, not the norm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tobacco industry, the pharmaceutical
industry, the alcohol industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just have such a head start and such
access to funds that it will make it
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult for cannabis to just be a
monster on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do see them bringing their
technology and their marketing insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us in the room that are hiring from
those other industries, we're hiring from
[SPEAKER_01]: those other industries because we know
they have the experience to do what we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do for our companies in relatively
similar, hate to use the word vice,
[SPEAKER_01]: but vice-related industries,
pharmaceutical being a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're going to look to how to
market cannabis well, you're going to look
[SPEAKER_01]: to a company that's been doing either
tobacco or alcohol because those are the
[SPEAKER_01]: most similar things that are being
marketed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that they offer a lot,
but they have to be managed and those
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships have to be managed so you
don't just get pushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing I'll add is I think,
yes, those businesses all have,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're mature, they come from mature
industries, and they obviously have
[SPEAKER_03]: framework that can be adapted for our
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially things like CBD where you're
talking about mature distribution
[SPEAKER_03]: channels.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing that all those industries
are going to need, and this is what we all
[SPEAKER_03]: need to understand, is it doesn't work if
you go and spin something up and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: not authenticity behind it and you get
into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the consumers see past that and
smell it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that bodes well for those of us
that understand who our customers are and
[SPEAKER_03]: our customers ourselves and live it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the marriage between
understanding cannabis and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: culture, which was bred over the 70 plus
years of prohibition, that doesn't just
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of get wiped away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Altria doesn't get to come in and sort of
do as they did with tobacco, nicotine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's the one piece that I
think we all need to understand is that
[SPEAKER_03]: they need us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't understand the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: All they understand is that it's white hot
and they gotta get some.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they need us to be able to sort of
route them and strategize essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'd say with that is the worst
investment or purchase one of those big
[SPEAKER_01]: companies could do would come with a
clearing of house because to your
[SPEAKER_01]: testament, you know a lot about
distribution, you know a lot about
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing cigarettes, whatever it is,
what you don't have is that ongoing
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very few products that people consume,
the product itself do they have that close
[SPEAKER_01]: connection with.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the alcohol world, if you have a really
close connection with alcohol,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're an alcoholic.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cannabis, it's part of whether you're
using it for heating or healing purposes
[SPEAKER_01]: or you're using it for enjoyment or
whatever it is, there's a connection there
[SPEAKER_01]: that simply slapping another brand name or
a large scale operator and I think a good
[SPEAKER_01]: example of that is the Starbucks guy was
I'm gonna take over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That did not go over well because the
cannabis space rejected that idea of just
[SPEAKER_01]: force feeding that down their throats and
to agree with Dean is I think that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot to offer them as well and I didn't
want to present that we don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just also know that a lot of what we're
building in many cases they already have,
[SPEAKER_01]: national distribution, framework for
dealing with interstate commerce and taxes
[SPEAKER_01]: and regulatory stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that's something that's completely,
we deal with a single tax authority,
[SPEAKER_01]: IRS, federal level and local but when
tobacco and alcohol moves across state
[SPEAKER_01]: lines, there's all kinds of new tax things
that will again be new to our industry
[SPEAKER_01]: unless we have someone kind of showing us
the way through those acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next question is about CBD which is
really a juggernaut right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: white hot I think you said and I wanted
everybody to hear kind of your perspective
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll start down here and work back on
how the popularity of CBD is impacting
[SPEAKER_04]: your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us in particular, it's significant
because our model over the last eight
[SPEAKER_01]: years going on nine years has been our
licensing where we're collecting a royalty
[SPEAKER_01]: from our licensees and individual states.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's substantial, it's nice, it grew our
company, it allowed us to spread our brand
[SPEAKER_01]: but it wasn't reflected in a significant
top line revenue generator.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you reverse the math out, it's great
but again it's not our top line,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's our licensees top line.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD allows at least our company the
ability now to handle and have that
[SPEAKER_01]: centralized manufacturing whereas
cannabis, you're stuck with potentially 50
[SPEAKER_01]: separate production facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's economically not sensible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Centralized production, centralized
distribution is something that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: accomplish with CBD so I see that as a
great value to our company.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, CBD and CBD products and
terpene products are a great way for us to
[SPEAKER_01]: start to access those cannabis curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marketplaces where cannabis is not yet
legal and retail where you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent on a small group of
dispensaries, you have access to hundreds
[SPEAKER_01]: of thousands of locations across the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take cigarettes, Dean is in the pre-roll
business, we have a hemp cigarette.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 374,000 locations in the United
States that sell cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge access to a market that we
wouldn't have previously had even if we
[SPEAKER_01]: had a licensee in every state so I think
that that's certainly going to pave the
[SPEAKER_01]: way for success for cannabis companies
that have the understanding to see that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's another part of the plant,
another part of the market and another
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity for us to access buyers that
we wouldn't necessarily be able to do if
[SPEAKER_01]: we were just focused on selling,
I won't say THC products but marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: products in the marijuana marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I agree, I think CBD and hemp and
specifically what the farm bill brought on
[SPEAKER_03]: is an absolute game changer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for my businesses, for Wagner DeMoss,
so we have a technology that rolls joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can roll more joints than people can
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, hemp is a different story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we can sit there and we can
distribute to 370,000 stores, smoke shops
[SPEAKER_03]: or C stores instead of the 500
dispensaries in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're talking about a massive broad
market and you're also talking about a
[SPEAKER_03]: great organic product that we think as far
as smokable hemp, which Scott does,
[SPEAKER_03]: we think it's a tobacco system and it's a
conversation play.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not sure about the health benefits but we
think it tastes better and it's less
[SPEAKER_03]: addictive.
[SPEAKER_03]: For bud.com, same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of delivering within a given
footprint that's tied to compliance in
[SPEAKER_03]: each state, now we can ship worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now the 97% of folks that land on bud
.com can actually buy something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Game changer, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a California company, are you guys
able to capitalize on the CBD trend?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, CBD is really interesting for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our target demographic is definitely ripe
for hemp drive CBD products.
[SPEAKER_02]: That said, it has the low point of entry
and women really feel safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of buzz around it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is also a little gray in terms of
legality still for consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really, as a smaller company,
trying to stay laser focused in our THC
[SPEAKER_02]: side of the business, making sure that we
build and scale sustainably in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely something that we keep
on our horizon in addition to things like
[SPEAKER_02]: multi-state and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: My next question is about licensing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure everybody can appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just heard a while ago, 50 different
states that you have to build factories
[SPEAKER_04]: in, et cetera, if you want to be a THC
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of companies right now are
partnering, they're JVing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of different models out
there, royalty.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to start with you,
Carly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you guys not licensing your name
into other states?
[SPEAKER_04]: You said that you're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can understand why you don't want to
physically build out in other states.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's holding you back on the
licensing part?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think part of it has just been,
again, that laser focus on building and
[SPEAKER_02]: scaling in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it's something that we've had
conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had conversations with different
people in different states.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just hasn't been the right
opportunity yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not something that the door is
closed to in any way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think you guys would rather build
out in separate states or is the licensing
[SPEAKER_04]: smarter?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you guys go about thinking about
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, every day is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some days we're like, we should move into
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This state right away, we have this and
this connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be so easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then other days, we had someone call
us from Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, hmm, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hadn't really considered Florida as
much as Nevada or some other states.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just different day to day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just haven't had the right opportunity
come across our plate yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think once it will, we'll make that
decision then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dean, as an investor and an operator,
you see both sides of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of the pros and cons of
owning everything yourself versus
[SPEAKER_04]: partnering and royalties, things like
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we see California is bigger than
Canada, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a massive market here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our ideas sort of across the board with
all the businesses is definitely to
[SPEAKER_03]: partner with strong folks that understand
their regions and have resources there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm a big believer in licensing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've licensed our technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Canada, and now we're rolling out,
licensing the pre-roll technology to
[SPEAKER_03]: multi-state operators in different regions
of the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: So big believers of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rolling out, I got that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scott, you guys obviously are very
advanced on the licensing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You talked about some of the pros and cons
already.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what else do you see as some of the
pros and cons of owning the assets versus
[SPEAKER_04]: partnering with people?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're in Canada through a
partnership, for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say more in some levels now it's a
necessity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because almost all states have limited
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many cases have to be vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about huge capital outlays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our licensee in New York just to turn in
their application was $1 million just to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's doing that 50 times over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then trying to manage all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each state's tax, really each company
would have to run as its own entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: More hair falling out than it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that we just felt licensing
was the best path for our goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's more mature players in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more mature operators in the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're still doing either licensing or
the preferences JV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply because they feel we have a bit
more skin in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been driven by both sides of
the table in that when you're in a market
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's a limited license count,
in many cases, they're the driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five years ago, I'd get a lot of calls of,
hey, we'd like the license bang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, we'd like the license bang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there was that drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other side of the table,
they're like, well, do we need bang?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have a captured market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use Trulieve as an example in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they call to ask us if they could
license bang, my first question is why?
[SPEAKER_01]: You control 75% of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between 70% and 75% of the market,
you've got to strangle on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you need bang?
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said, because people are asking
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the right response that I want to
hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a licensing agreement with them
versus a JV.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the players in the marketplace
I'm actually more comfortable licensing to
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little more visibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Origin House, formerly Canter Royalties,
they're publicly traded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trulieve just went public.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more confidence that this is
not going to be someone that you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: baby sit your brand, but them as
operators, the state's looking over their
[SPEAKER_01]: shoulder with testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state's looking over their shoulder
with compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that baby sitting that we had to
do several years ago, we don't have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can focus on supporting them as a
brand, rather than just making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing things right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I hear you saying is a few years
ago, you really had some risk in who you
[SPEAKER_04]: licensed to.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could mess it up, and you didn't have
the control.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there's enough confidence,
there's enough information out there that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're you can do these deals and pick the
right partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, even on testing,
something simple is having to hound
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need your lab results, because there
was no regulation mandating them to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was us mandating it, versus now,
I simply get a copy of what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: already sending to the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a lot of cases, the state is
picking up that responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still mandate it as part of our
agreements, but I don't have to stay on
[SPEAKER_01]: them to do it, because in order to sell
the product, they already had to do it for
[SPEAKER_01]: the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a follow up for you, anybody else can
weigh in as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have these captive states,
like you mentioned, and some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: operators are doing the license deals like
you did with TrueLeaf that you said.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, we're starting to
see some of these multi-state operators go
[SPEAKER_04]: out and buy brands in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just curious what you think about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're trying to be everything,
it seems like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always believed do what you do best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never been a fan of verticals,
simply because I don't think that as a
[SPEAKER_01]: operator, that you can't be a great
grower, and a great brand builder,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a great retail, and all the things
that come through there out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, acquiring a bunch of those things,
and I'll use Origin House as a good
[SPEAKER_01]: example, they took the best of each of
those levels in what they felt,
[SPEAKER_01]: and put that together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they kept those teams in place that
were doing those jobs well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to come out of the block and say,
I can do everything well, I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the buying the brands is building a
brand, developing a product that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: specialized skill set.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to acquire those items
that they feel they couldn't do as well on
[SPEAKER_01]: their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it's economically sensible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They already have a market share.
[SPEAKER_01]: They already have loyal followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They already have formulas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They already understand the equipment
list, everything you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Picking that up, and then applying it into
their market is a great opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every company is going to have a
different model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, again, just one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually see, as the industry grows,
we see sort of roles shrinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, to Scott's point,
on the pre-roll side, where we co-pack for
[SPEAKER_03]: 44 brands, we see folks really slotting
into lanes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree that I think vertical
integration is just not the way to build
[SPEAKER_03]: great, efficient companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of absurd, frankly, if you look
across the board at other industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we do see is we see brands being
brands, and then working with cultivators
[SPEAKER_03]: as their processing partners, and then
working with a distributor to go and sell
[SPEAKER_03]: their stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we see, is essentially
folks falling into roles that are becoming
[SPEAKER_03]: a little more granular and defined.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I think we'll open it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a few minutes left.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anybody have any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it once again for Alan and the
entire panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, please keep your questions
brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a long statement, write a
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: One guy will help you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I was a little disappointed in
seeing the future being painted without
[SPEAKER_06]: vertical integration.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm concerned about it with the
opportunity of this being the people's
[SPEAKER_06]: plant, that the big guys are going to come
in, and it's going to be trickled down,
[SPEAKER_06]: which doesn't trickle down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm mostly concerned about the
farmers, being a farmer from New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are starting a company that has a
vertical integration through partnerships.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a comment, because when I see all
those big names, it looks like we're going
[SPEAKER_06]: to miss the opportunity to be the people
that have a different economy for the
[SPEAKER_06]: future in the picture that I just heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say you misheard what I
said, but vertical actually allows the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers to be the farmers and thrive as
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't do and build a farm,
because there's a lot of great farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can build relationships with and
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that when a large corporation
comes in and says, we're going to do our
[SPEAKER_01]: own farm, and our own extraction,
and our own production, and our own
[SPEAKER_01]: retail, that doesn't acknowledge the fact
that there's already those four groups of
[SPEAKER_01]: people there that would be better to
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bang's position is, we've never been a
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't, maybe not while I'm in charge,
but because we're not farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's great farmers out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a brand and as a product producer,
our best contribution to the industry as a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole in its vertical form is to support
those who are already doing that great,
[SPEAKER_01]: not figure out how to make more money by
getting rid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a great opportunity for us to
support them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea of vertical integration is
something that the cannabis invented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miller doesn't grow wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hershey doesn't grow sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coca-Cola doesn't grow corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That companies are successful because they
support farmers, not try to push them out
[SPEAKER_01]: by doing it themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that's not what you heard as my
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scott?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doomguy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, the ghost in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can smaller farmers or smaller
businesses work with some of these larger
[SPEAKER_00]: investment companies and things?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you, without getting squeezed out,
I mean, you say that Coca-Cola doesn't buy
[SPEAKER_00]: corn syrup, but I'm sure they have a say
in the corn prices, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're not getting as much per
acre or per plant or per pound as you were
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were an independent guy and you
gotta work with these bigger things,
[SPEAKER_00]: how can they maximize their profit or
their yield while still working with some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these larger places?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, well, I've got an answer for
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also think that the first step of
that is grow really good wheat and someone
[SPEAKER_03]: will want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always the first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always the first step.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wheat sells itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good first step.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, one thing that, first thing that
comes to mind is actually a value
[SPEAKER_03]: proposition that we explain to all our
partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tell them to, you know, essentially to
put as much of your wheat into pre-rolls
[SPEAKER_03]: as you can because you get more for your
buck.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the highest sort of net back out for
a cultivation, essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pre-rolls just back out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They pencil the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you take your small buds and you make
them worth more than your really nice
[SPEAKER_03]: colas by putting them into pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I was wondering if you guys,
you touched upon licensing, if you had
[SPEAKER_05]: issues with any of the state's regulatory
agencies regarding licensing and wanting
[SPEAKER_05]: ownership information.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is coming from the California
permanent regulations that just were
[SPEAKER_05]: released regarding, you know, it was an
issue if the BCC wasn't gonna allow
[SPEAKER_05]: California companies to license in other
states and it turns out they probably just
[SPEAKER_05]: want the ownership information.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I just wanted to know how
you guys had come across that,
[SPEAKER_05]: if there were any issues around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly haven't come across that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My very quick answer to that is along the
years we've had to adjust our licensing
[SPEAKER_01]: agreements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they were per unit fee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it was a percentage of sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of that was understanding how you
can operate within the confines of the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I'm sorry, within the regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some cases we ended up not doing
licensing agreements because there was not
[SPEAKER_01]: a way to do it that was within the
confines of state law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would have been considered an effective
owner and would have had to go on their
[SPEAKER_01]: documentation as an owner of their license
or a portion of their license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that case they put up all this
money for a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not going to have us be an owner
of their license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you gotta work within each
state's regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some cases that means you don't get
to go play in that sandbox.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so basically that was the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially you have to back out state by
state and basically put the puzzle
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of it is basically reformatting
the pay structure, the compensation
[SPEAKER_03]: structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's either a percentage or a flat fee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the selling of materials.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's getting creative to sort of back
into whatever that jurisdiction wants it
[SPEAKER_03]: to look like.
Thank you.
Thank you.
