[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you've been really living under a
rock and you're not involved in following
[SPEAKER_02]: the international scene, you may not know
what blockchain is, but the next speaker
[SPEAKER_02]: is an expert on the matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is an American expatriate who's
stationed here in Germany who writes about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis business news and breaks stories
here in Germany, and her company MedPayRx
[SPEAKER_02]: is an innovative blockchain company,
and she will tell you what that entails.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please give a warm welcome for Ms.
Marguerite Arnold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm after lunch, I'm the act,
but thank you all for making it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you also, thank you very much to
Alex and team for making the sophomore
[SPEAKER_00]: year of the ICBC what it is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we have a round of applause?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have worked their butts off,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, my name is Marguerite Arnold,
and I'm here to give you a very quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: easy deep dive in 15 minutes on a new
technology called blockchain and how it is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to disrupt our already disruptive
business, and it is going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be big.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of ways to think about
this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the easiest ways to begin to
understand how this technology works and
[SPEAKER_00]: how you can apply it in what you do is to
understand that it is a protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the geeks in the audience who know what
TCP IP is for voice, it's what makes your
[SPEAKER_00]: handiwork, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or those people who understand what HTTPS
is, which really allows you to type in
[SPEAKER_00]: google.com as opposed to a string of
numbers in your browser.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have that website come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what blockchain is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little bit more geeky,
and it's coming out of the banking
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in particular, and it functions
along a pretty simple idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: KYC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the uninitiated in the audience
and the people who are still asleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not a new brand of cannabis
flavored sex gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although maybe it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually comes out of banking geek
speak, and it means know your client.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, you need to know
everything about your clients so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not a terrorist and where they live and
what their bank account is, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But within the context of what blockchain
really is going to be beyond banking,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really means being able to understand
and verify, if not authenticate,
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many different points of data in a
complex ecosystem without necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: having all of the knowledge that you would
traditionally have or think that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that sounds a little bit like the
cannabis business in general, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is exactly where it lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is kind of abstract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give you a little bit of a
fun example about how to understand this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of verification in this kind of
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've already told you my name,
and you can both hear and see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you think about that or not,
those are three different independent
[SPEAKER_00]: verification points that tells your brain
you're here in Berlin and not on Mars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're on Mars, we'll check in with
you later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you, yes, also know me as an
industry journalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't, you can Google me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another kind of independent
verification.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a blockchain enthusiast,
if not expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where does that come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me give you a little bit more
information that you can also verify via
[SPEAKER_00]: very different ideas and channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I say to all of my German friends,
yes, I'm an American refugee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually the first in my very,
very old German family that I can trace
[SPEAKER_00]: back close to 1,000 years to actually come
back here to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did grow up in an unusual family.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not me in the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good friend of my dad's.
[SPEAKER_00]: My two paternal uncles were people you
probably know or heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was a guy named Peter Drucker,
the father of business and the information
[SPEAKER_00]: worker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one deciphered the Dead Sea
Scrolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a little fellow that I met at
the age of eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The father of that is a guy named Gray
Walter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the early, early pioneers
really in robotics and cyberkinetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: where a lot of this has come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Turtle, I met this guy when I was
eight years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would scuttle around on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew where to go to plug himself back
in the wall when he ran out of juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met this guy at the age of eight
when the world was just meeting R2D2 for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that this was love at first
sight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, that's kind of where I've
worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've taken elements of this from
banking and technology that I've worked on
[SPEAKER_00]: and the kinds of industries that I've
pulled together over my life to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring together what I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to think about what
blockchain is at its fundamental,
[SPEAKER_00]: level it is a language that allows robots
and computers to all, and occasionally
[SPEAKER_00]: humans while they still let us,
to all talk to one another in a new and
[SPEAKER_00]: different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also allows people to connect very
different sources of data and people and
[SPEAKER_00]: enterprises in a new kind of ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: All blockchains also use coins or tokens
or smart contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: These terms are used interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And increasingly it's not up to you to
define what those are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's other compliance systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna get into that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this, make no mistake about it,
is the backbone infrastructure technology
[SPEAKER_00]: behind IoT, which is the internet of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be interacting with AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be responsible for all sorts of
automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drones, I joke about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do you use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a cannabis executive, OMG,
another thing to deal with, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So which blockchain do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're a couple, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Bitcoin, which was a blockchain
before it was a coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Ethereum.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Ether.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which cyber currency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're all tied to those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna make it easy for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost, speed, and energy efficiency are the
three things that you should immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: be looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately all blockchains also
use electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at every hop of the node, they're using
electricity to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking for that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're really looking for right
now, because the blockchains that are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there are pretty impressive already,
is what are called dApps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is just short term for
distributed application.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've taken a look at the pretty front
end, it looks like a regular app.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is that we are not tying
into any sort of centralized system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all decentralized from the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna show you a little bit about
the engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond the technology, you gotta look
for what that dApp actually does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it do something that solves your
business problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't, keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the back end, a very artistic
representation of what our system looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor here, we never issue a coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: As MedPayRx, we never issue a coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never gonna be available on any
exchange, it cannot be stolen,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not worth anything in the
traditional idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have taken the idea of what a
prescription is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a contract between multiple parties
and two payers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've set up a banking system to allow
that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never transfer medical data on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is that the doctor is the
issuing bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones who issue the coin,
and it goes first to the insurer,
[SPEAKER_00]: who hopefully not only underwrites it,
but approves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It then goes to the patient who is able to
copay and forward that to the bank while
[SPEAKER_00]: sending a push notification to the
distributor to tell you guys real-time
[SPEAKER_00]: information about where your product is in
play and where's it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We deal with rebates as well, and I can
give you more information if you wanna
[SPEAKER_00]: stop by the booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea was not to promote MedPay,
but I wanna show you the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between what we're doing and an ICO,
because I'm sure you guys have all heard
[SPEAKER_00]: about this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is an ICO?
[SPEAKER_00]: An ICO is just geek speak for an
initiative.
[SPEAKER_00]: An initial coin offering, sometimes
they're called TGE events, token
[SPEAKER_00]: generation events, is basically the same
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: A private entity or even a non-profit or a
government issues a coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be for a raise of money,
it could be for a community, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the moment that you're charging a
customer for that coin, for whatever it is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're doing it, you're in the
financial space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everywhere now, no matter where you
are, that is federal banking law that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be in compliance with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna back up here a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has to be in compliance, if we rolled
out correctly, with German banking,
[SPEAKER_00]: German banking privacy and medical privacy
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting a digital focus and process
on a system that has already been
[SPEAKER_00]: established under compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that, for the financial
geeks in the room, looks very much like a
[SPEAKER_00]: stock issuance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is why this is also so incredibly
dangerous right now for this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in the United States,
for reasons that include everything about
[SPEAKER_00]: you cannot have a bank account.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in other places, you have to make sure
that this model is also in compliance with
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while there's nothing wrong with this,
and in fact, this is a very smart way to
[SPEAKER_00]: raise money for things like drones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I joke about this all the time,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Drones are gonna be paid for by cyber
currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the top companies are raising
money for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all airspace is gonna be controlled,
low-lying airspace is gonna be controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: by blockchain systems, which are gonna be
paid for by rent with cyber currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And airspace does, in fact, have a value.
[SPEAKER_00]: However crazy that may sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that particular kind of instance,
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then what are you gonna be carrying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, all of the steps that
you have to go through for a successful
[SPEAKER_00]: ICO, you're gonna have to go through to
raise money successfully via other ways
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do an ICO, you better be in
compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better have a good lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better be working closely with a bank
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that they're necessarily all bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that they're very dangerous if
you don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the takeaways, because I'd like to end
this early because I know there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at this and trying to
evaluate blockchain for your business,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would stay away from the hottest and
greatest cannabis blockchain out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a couple out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could not be, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for what the dApps do on that
existing blockchain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they solve your problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they compliance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they in compliance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are they in compliance in all the
different industry verticals that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: required to be in compliance with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a banking app that allows you to buy
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in Canada, you're gonna have
to make sure that your users are over 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the kinds of ideas, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As my late uncle Peter used to say,
technology is just a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't solve your problem,
why bother with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So look for that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ICOs and token generation have their
place, but just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that note, I think I'm gonna end
this and open it up for any questions
[SPEAKER_00]: there might be and go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have a question or two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see you have a question about the
bit chain and the blockchain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come see me later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there he is over there.
Okay.
I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've eaten a lot of bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've gained some weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is lots of cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks a lot for that very informative
presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you maybe in regards to the ICO have
any source of credible good information
[SPEAKER_03]: that you could recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: About what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where you can find out if you're
doing it and are you doing it in Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: Swiss based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swiss based.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Swiss actually, I mean,
again, Switzerland and a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: countries in the Far East are actually
good places to actually do ICOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the next problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rumor in Frankfurt last month was
that no German bank would be accepting ICO
[SPEAKER_00]: funds no matter where those funds were
raised and for what a purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even if they knew the identity of
you and all the people you were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: money from, they could not trace the
source of the coin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, all of these are anonymous
coins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't figure out what the coins
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the German authorities are not really
hip to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're gonna be doing business in
Germany, raising money by an ICO,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of the things you have to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna be doing business in
Switzerland, if you're gonna have one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things happening in Russia with the
funds or maybe Singapore or et cetera
[SPEAKER_00]: where the banks are a lot more interested
in this kind of activity, then where are
[SPEAKER_00]: you gonna spend those funds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the problems downstream
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are people who are doing it
successfully, but you just have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering like how secure are
blockchains or bitcoins or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: they're called from like government
intrusion, like what's the stop some
[SPEAKER_01]: government from just shutting everything
down and then everybody's out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, that's actually a couple of
questions, but let me just answer this
[SPEAKER_00]: first one on government interference in
cyber currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chinese government actually has just
moved into stop exchanges and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like ICOs very much either.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think that this is out there and
not regulated and they can't do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, they can just cut the switch off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do a lot of tracing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the cyber currency that is traded
in the United States right now has got to
[SPEAKER_00]: be listed on these exchanges and the IRS,
when you sell them, looks at this as a
[SPEAKER_00]: capital gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is tech is changing quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the time we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really, really appreciate it,
Marguerite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure she'd love to talk to you
more in the hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just mention one last thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those of you have not signed up for
this, Phil Sinadela is running that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: organizing the German Patient Roundtable
and it's an idea that's intended to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with all of us here, but do it in a new
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't signed up for him,
please go see him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about patient access and it's really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you again, all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being such a great audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please come and see me in the back
with questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
