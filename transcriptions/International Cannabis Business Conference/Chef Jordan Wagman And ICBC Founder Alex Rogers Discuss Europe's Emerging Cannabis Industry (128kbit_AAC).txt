[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually the first time we are
continuing a theme.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last show, it hasn't dropped yet,
but the one that's just preceding this one
[SPEAKER_03]: was a couple of my friends that we hung
out in Spain together and we attended the
[SPEAKER_03]: ICBC in Spanibus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it was a tremendous time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I talked a lot about how, you know,
similarly, how when I went to Vegas to
[SPEAKER_03]: attend MJ Biz, I ended up leaving having
said, you know, and all due respect to MJ
[SPEAKER_03]: Biz, but MJ Unpacked was really the show
that I thoroughly enjoyed and brought a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot more value to my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we hosted George J.
John.
[SPEAKER_03]: And going to Spain, I thought I was really
going to Spain to attend Spanibus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in truth, I was going to Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up going to Spain and attended the
ICBC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the international cannabis business
conference, correct, Alex?
Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the best time at ICBC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so subsequently, I had to reach out to
Alex, who is the owner, the CEO.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure, you know, the brains behind the
ICBC and really try to find out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the certainly the, you know,
what the catalyst to wanting to create
[SPEAKER_03]: something in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: More to be to be, which I'll tell you was
something that for me was a welcome
[SPEAKER_03]: addition to my time in in Spain,
but also really Europe as a whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what that looks like, because I had a
couple of takeaways and I won't,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I don't want to lead the
witness.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want to talk about Alex and his,
you know, his is coming to Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Alex Rogers, as I said, is the owner
and CEO of the ICBC, but, but,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, but ladies, gentlemen, all friends of
mine who are out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: High Times called him, and I quote,
GI Joe handsome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm telling you, as I stand here
before you, stitch here, as a matter of
[SPEAKER_03]: fact, I am telling you, we are on camera
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you are only listening to this and
have not had the pleasure of seeing this
[SPEAKER_03]: footage, he is one handsome fellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's a family man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a vocalist, which I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see some keyboards behind him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we'll actually jam out before,
before he's a lover of all things,
[SPEAKER_03]: travel and languages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I heard him mention his wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's a loving, you know, certainly
husband.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to find out about his kids,
BS kids, but Alex Rogers, dude,
[SPEAKER_03]: welcome to the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, Jordan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, such a, uh, exalted and yet
embarrassing introduction in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: We pride ourselves on in the weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We pride ourselves on those amazing
introductions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just so you know, it goes downhill
from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, anything, anything less would be
uncivilized.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes downhill from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all bullshit aside, congratulations,
because I'll tell you going into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't, I was unsure.
[SPEAKER_03]: ICBC was fantastic in, in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've been working our butts off
for years, uh, uh, to make these
[SPEAKER_01]: conferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do, you know, I used to do
produce hip hop shows back in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, back in the day in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and, uh, I have an event
background and then, uh, I just started
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this about, uh, I started a medical
marijuana clinic in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 13 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they, they legalized in
Oregon, I started getting all these
[SPEAKER_01]: questions and I was like, you know what,
I'm going to start a conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used some of those skills that I did
just being a hip hop producer and did a
[SPEAKER_01]: weed conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made like 30 grand off my first
conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, this is a lot better
than the music industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, and so then I just got kind of
hooked and we started doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: conferences, uh, basically all throughout
Oregon first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we blew up in Oregon, the B2B style.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I, then I said, well,
I want to do the international cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: business conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had lived in Europe for eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my wife is from Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spend every summer in Europe,
uh, actually moving there in a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: months too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my dream was always, uh,
uh, to be the, to basically, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: go into Europe and be the first to do the,
and biggest hopefully, uh, which we became
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, but I really had this European
vision the whole time that we would get
[SPEAKER_01]: back, that I would get back to Europe and
I would do something special there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to run the high times cannabis cup
back in the day, 20 years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: over 20 years ago, I ran the concert
house, the milk bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, that was the biggest cannabis
event at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had this kind of this pedigree,
this vision, this, this life that was kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of, if I had, if I worked hard,
got lucky and did some of the right
[SPEAKER_01]: things, I actually knew that I could maybe
achieve this, at the time, fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: grandiose vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so has the vision evolved a lot since
its inception?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, I was reading, is it 2017 that
that was the first show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, 27, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first ICBC was 2014 in Portland,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went San Francisco and I think
to 16 week went to Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was only kind of international.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, uh, and it wasn't until we got
to, to Europe that I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we did Berlin in 2017, that, that I was
like, okay, we are actually international,
[SPEAKER_01]: truly international now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and what I did was I,
I booked the event, the venue in 2016,
[SPEAKER_01]: when that shit was going on in Germany,
it was a thousand medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Germans would be like,
Alex, we have very worried for you $500 a
[SPEAKER_01]: ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not know how you say very frugal
people, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were literally like saying that
to me, to my German partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I figured it's, it's all inevitable,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not me, it's going to be somebody
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just, and if I got to lose a
little money, the first, whatever this or
[SPEAKER_01]: that, then whatever, I'm, I'm okay with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll build the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did it and we, I booked it in
two 16 and all of a sudden medical blew up
[SPEAKER_01]: in between the time I booked the event and
the two 17 show, which was in,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think April and medical medical just
went robust right in between that time
[SPEAKER_01]: gave doctors all this leeway to give put
the pharmacies, the insurance,
[SPEAKER_01]: reimbursement, all this, you can do
licensed production now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this, and so two 17 Berlin basically
blew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got kind of lucky that on the timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and so I actually think things
happened actually quicker than I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had the lockdowns and then
there was that the lockdown period where
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that actually set us back a
little bit, but not as much as maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now as we're back, because because if
we kept our brand going, because of pent
[SPEAKER_01]: up demand, we're going to exponent,
uh, exponential growth right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you go virtual at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was any, did you, did you, I had one
virtual event.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had Rick Steeves keynote.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had Tommy Chong doing DJ mugs and Ed
Rosenthal on my smoke breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, conceptually it was okay,
but it was just so drab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like kissing your sister,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just the worst thing ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll never, I mean, I just felt dirty
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I'm a real people, hands-on guy,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this virtual thing, uh,
uh, as a conference is it really just hurt
[SPEAKER_01]: my soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was okay to do for our brand and
it went okay, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but for me it was, it was a painful
experience and one that I vowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never say never do anything again,
but I'm pretty fucking sure I will never
[SPEAKER_01]: do any online event ever again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think virtual will ever,
ever leave my offering because it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's a way to connect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now all my meetings were zoom and I
have this more personal connection where I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought that would have been, uh,
uh, that where I'm kind of an old dinosaur
[SPEAKER_01]: before and I just got on the phone or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and then the podcast now that here
you are, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, I mean, it's a, it's,
it's, it's, it's a tremendous boom for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me personally, being this guy
who's always gathered people together,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it virtually is, is it just,
it's like a stake through my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how bad it is for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you something, Alex,
just so you know, what drove that home for
[SPEAKER_03]: me was because as much as I believe that
as part of virtual experiences are here to
[SPEAKER_03]: stay, but there is no replacement for
getting on a fucking plane, heading to
[SPEAKER_03]: Spain, going to Barcelona, meeting people
from all over the world, going to have
[SPEAKER_03]: drinks, going to smoke some joints,
go into bond.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you something, those are
friends for fucking life.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're friends for life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's, there's no substitute for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's zero substitute for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I create and curate these wonderful
environments for that are really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm not a snob.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a man of the people, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate snobbery and elitism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I really like my events to be this
like, well, if you come to the ICBC,
[SPEAKER_01]: your ICBC family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I got my one rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, when I get up on stage to start the
event is don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our only rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's funny as you're saying
that, do you know, do you know what
[SPEAKER_03]: emphasized that for me was Jamie Pearson
to, you know, Jamie and I, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, from a, we met in Vegas and,
and a tremendous mutual respect from afar,
[SPEAKER_03]: but finally we got to spend a lot of time
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And both of my brothers came out to
Barcelona to hang with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was shooting some cannabis
content in Madrid for Institute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, it's the best Jamie and I got to
hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to meet, you know, Sean Cridle,
who, you know, from pineapple express,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just, those are the type of people
you're drawing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you the other one at the top
of the list was Jim Belushi.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right at the top for me was meeting him
and, you know, and just realizing exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: what Zoe Wilder said he was an
approachable dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's just an approachable guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what, dude, you did that for
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I wanted to bring you on
the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't tell you that in advance,
but I always talk about people who
[SPEAKER_03]: positively impact me because I,
my goal is always to positively impact at
[SPEAKER_03]: least one person a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you impacted my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: My life positively.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to tell you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's feedback, feedback like that,
that just keeps me going and knowing what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And knowing creating this, this culture
around the event also is it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a nice vibe where people can
breathe, relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like it, and it's not like MJ biz
and enough respect to MJ biz, but you
[SPEAKER_01]: really, if you're, if you go into even a
guy like me, who's an old industry head,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go to MJ biz, I'm going to feel like
I'm just, I'm the new kid on the block or
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any friends around or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all this, this kind of
overwhelming experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas these more intimate curated events
are you, you feel more of a connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I get a lot of feedback like that
and it really puts wind in my sail and
[SPEAKER_01]: keeps me going, working 15 hours a day
every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I want to go back to it,
but I, you have to drill into your past.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was something that I read about
your, you know, your story, quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing people to tears.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I, you know, I think you and I are
going to connect over our stories and what
[SPEAKER_03]: brought us to cannabis, but we all
inevitably have a story and what brought
[SPEAKER_03]: us here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you just sort of where'd you grow up
and, you know, and what brought you to
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm a, I'm a, I'm basically a total
city kid from Minneapolis, went to public
[SPEAKER_01]: schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: My whole life graduated from South High.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had a pretty multicultural upbringing with
my friends and my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just loved cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had a disease, ulcerative
colitis when I was young and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: started smoking cannabis to help that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eventually found new ways through food
and yoga and meditation and slow stress
[SPEAKER_01]: lifestyle and ganja.
[SPEAKER_01]: And living my life and being free and
happy to cure myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce Lee says there's no cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live right alongside my disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, it's not encompassing me,
but I never pushed it too far away because
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a metaphor for, it's a great,
from the Dao of Jeet Kune Do, a great
[SPEAKER_01]: metaphor of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was, so I got way into weed and,
you know, I was really smart student
[SPEAKER_01]: gifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I said, I didn't get
bad till I got to like high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just started questioning and
doing crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually I moved up to
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: My girlfriend at the time was a junior
transfer to UCSC Santa Cruz, a banana
[SPEAKER_01]: slug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went out to Santa Cruz in 92.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I met Jack Hare in 93.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I met Jack, that's when I
started working for him on his California
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was doing these other events.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a human peace chain in Lighthouse
Point in 94.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be Real from Cypress Hill came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Northridge earthquake was like 10
hours after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just some deep, heavy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were pushing hard back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always believe, I just was always a
fan of cannabis and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I started singing, you know,
I started getting into hip hop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of the few white rappers that
back in the day and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: well before M&M or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was one of the few white rappers
that could chant dance hall.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I was, so I got into Rastafarianism
and Rasta culture and Nyabingi and
[SPEAKER_01]: drumming and chanting and, and it was all
kind of cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just this whole cannabis world I
was in and I just loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Rasta say it's the healing
of the nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always figured, you know,
the world's going so one way and hemp is
[SPEAKER_01]: this way that it's got to be the right
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what, that's kind of
basically how I got started with just hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: activism and hip hop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were two really big, they were
really synonymous.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Cypress Hill came out and then you
started, it was like, it was like edgy to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about pot back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and nobody, but yet nobody was doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was still like a little bit,
you know, you heard, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: nice and smooth had that I left my Philly
at home and now I need a another,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get blood in my brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then total devastation took that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get blood in my brother off and
then put it to the tribe called quest
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so you're starting to see it,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these bands that are almost like using
it as a, as a, as a gimmick, or it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: real thing in their life or whatever,
however it was construed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was right at that time of when the
activism all happened and, and 90s hip hop
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is before.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the bullshit rap took over and we
actually had all this varying different
[SPEAKER_01]: wraps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I worked a lot with hieroglyphics and
Delta funky homo sapien and sold the
[SPEAKER_01]: mischief and worked with the alcoholics,
all types of really like amazing crews out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I will, my love for cannabis
is it's not only just cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's embedded in all these other
subcultures of America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you know, often, oftentimes I used
to think, and I talk about this often,
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, there's not a room I have
where there's no, there's not a guitar
[SPEAKER_03]: laying around, but I often used to think I
was, I loved cannabis because I used to
[SPEAKER_03]: love the,
[SPEAKER_03]: so, you know, because I love Scarlett
Begonia's and the Grateful Dead that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that was sort of my explanation
for my love of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like you, I was diagnosed at 12
years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: With psoriasis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I spent, and the audience has heard
this at nauseam, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: as soon as someone mentions it,
mentioned this, and I didn't realize you
[SPEAKER_03]: and I were going to connect over,
you know, our diseases and coming to
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, but clearly there's,
there's this link.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, I've smoked joints every day
of my life since I was before preteen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and the reason is because I was
diagnosed with psoriasis and I was wake
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would wake up every morning with blood
in my sheets and covered in like flakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wrote every high school exam in the
hospital and spent a year and a half of my
[SPEAKER_03]: life sleeping in a tent at the Dead Sea in
Israel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, dude, I did every fucking thing I
could, but until seven years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: until I removed gluten, dairy,
and refined sugar from my diet and began
[SPEAKER_03]: consuming cannabis with the intention of
healing myself, lowering my inflammation.
[SPEAKER_03]: 60 days later, my brother, 60 days later,
30 pounds melted off my body and my
[SPEAKER_03]: psoriasis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the last seven years, what I do is
I build the narrative worldwide for what
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis can be in food and beverage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not what everyone fucking knows or thinks
about food and beverage, which is the
[SPEAKER_03]: gummies, the cookies, the brownies.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not healing us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's such a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the Rastafarian in me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk high tall living, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you have a, you have a fucking
brownie or a gummy and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what's in that fucking gummy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it's not, if it's not honey
sweetened, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not NG, no GMOs, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like, like the money I spend on food
a year is absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always conscious that,
that, that, that, that, that poor folk
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have these options and they're in
this food desert, eating, being poisoned
[SPEAKER_01]: and killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when LeBron James says black lives
matter and then comes on and does a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking McDonald's commercial,
the next thing it irks me and all me and
[SPEAKER_01]: all my rasta brethren.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are just say Faya Agoban, Faya Agoban,
because it's not, it's not this,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis is representative of
something so much greater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that health and health is holistic and
you have to have it on all levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Refined sugar could be the worst thing
that anyone could fucking eat in this
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's killing people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we send people to McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we talk about health, but we don't
talk about, but then we, we don't ever,
[SPEAKER_01]: we see a fast food commercial on TV and it
just goes right over our head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all the black people like,
Oh, I want a Big Mac.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, girl, get yourself a Big Mac.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most racist fucking bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is shit I've been touting for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been going into the hood saying,
don't smoke tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's Modiano papers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't smoke the thick tops or zigzags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoked the Modiano.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the best paper back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I smoke Ziggy's from Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, don't, don't drink the malt
liquor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a micro brew.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no, this is process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay away from some of this soul food is
killing you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, this is, and this is totally
for poor people in general, but for the
[SPEAKER_01]: black community is, is, is being,
and the poor community and the general
[SPEAKER_01]: American community is being targeted for
destruction through the food industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is nothing like really,
you know, this is not any revelatory thing
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying here, but I think people get
confused when they, when they talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: healing that just like you say,
no dairy, no refined sugar, take gluten
[SPEAKER_01]: out and gluten and dairy are okay for some
people, but for a lot, they're really not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you, when you take those things
out of your diet, you know, your food is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the most, is, is the most important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Food and sleep are the two most important
things to heal somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, if, if, and so, and so I don't
know, I'm, I'm, I'm, you got me excited
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is my, it's not, I'm not just
here to put a cannabis conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in legalization of all drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in a decentralized society built
from community up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're getting all your food from
everywhere else, then, and you're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: all your everything from everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's happening now with the supply
page, supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, how did commoditization of everything
work out for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to go back to our communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to eat food that's grown in our
communities and people just are so
[SPEAKER_01]: disconnected from their bodies and their
souls.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's up to us for us to,
to, to, to bridge that, that, that gap,
[SPEAKER_01]: people who have healed themselves from
diseases, you know, we can't, I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a time where I was very
disconnected from my body also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to have patience for these,
the, you know, and, and, and understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to just help educate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just sitting here making notes and
like nodding my head just constantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a couple of things all about balance,
love balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, I, I, I encourage balance in my
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Balance doesn't exist where I eat healthy
and then choose to go eat a Big Mac.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're bouncing me like, okay,
I had a, I had an organic piece of bread,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I still had the bread.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I probably wouldn't even have the
bread because the gluten will destroy me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd love to have a beer, but I want
the, my cheat might be, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had hugging does like I had a spoonful
of hugging does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like God strike me down for the first time
in five months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a spoonful of hugging does like
if that's my balance that I strike,
[SPEAKER_03]: so be it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I encourage people to strike balance,
but it's not through McDonald's because
[SPEAKER_03]: that is part of a it's not food.
[SPEAKER_03]: B it's part of this, what I call this big
gulp culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just everything is an excess.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you think about even these quote
unquote healthier alternatives,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, where I talk about like
cheesecake factory, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: where you go to Boca Raton and I,
you know, my, we drive up to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: power line and we get to Boca or the 95,
we get to Boca.
[SPEAKER_03]: We go in, we know that we are standing in
line for an hour to get into cheesecake
[SPEAKER_03]: factory where they're serving you a
portion that every single person,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you are leaving, not leaving there,
if you're not leaving there with a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: to-go container for lunch the next day,
you've overeaten because the portion sizes
[SPEAKER_03]: are like for three, four or five people,
but that's what, that's what we teach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's, I'm so hardcore that I'm
like on my organic food box.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it says natural flavor, I'm like,
eh, I won't even buy prepared foods,
[SPEAKER_03]: brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, I, I'll tell you, so there's one
product and I'm working on a product right
[SPEAKER_03]: now with them and I don't, I have,
I get zero for saying the name ZenSweet,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's a company called ZenSweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: They created this monk fruit sweetened
shelf stable cake mixes, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: snickerdoodles, cookie mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fucking- Monk fruit and coconut
fruit, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maple syrup is my go-to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that is my sweetener.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a, I'm a Canadian, I'm a Canadian boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maple syrup, when you reduce it down,
I can do anything that I can do with
[SPEAKER_03]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that, and it's an unrefined sweetener.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, it's amazing, but you know,
it's, it, it really always drives me
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was one of them, but you mentioned
it and maybe I don't have your phrasing
[SPEAKER_03]: properly, but I'll paraphrase,
but like you weren't in tune with your
[SPEAKER_03]: body.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in tune with my body and I think
many people are in tune with the body,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they've accepted that, Hey,
yeah, I'm going to go out tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll probably have a stomach ache
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll bring some antacids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, why don't you just not eat that
food?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have to have the antacid and
you know, and have this shit, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: building up inside of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've become so immune and numb to the
notion of we eat and then there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: repercussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not supposed to be that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're supposed to eat and it's supposed to
nourish us and make us feel good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to McDonald's, you have a,
you have an egg McMuffin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't had one in decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guarantee people that eat one,
they go to the bathroom in a half an hour
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know, it makes them feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a nostalgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a substitute for every nostalgic
shit food I ate when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it's used to be the veggie dogs
or whether it's the now it's this type of
[SPEAKER_01]: organic cookie instead of, you know,
this or that, you know, I, or if it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Cruz Coca-Cola, instead of like,
I will not eat Babylonian food period to
[SPEAKER_01]: the point of where if it's not at some
higher quality product, I won't eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't eat for days if I didn't,
if I didn't have, you know, eventually I
[SPEAKER_01]: would, but it's like, you have to have
high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just in a luxury position to be
conscious enough about it and have the
[SPEAKER_01]: money to buy this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all, it's all just, you know,
whole paycheck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but it's just important to know that,
yeah, man, this is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what cannabis represents to me
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It represents that whole entire whole
holistic spectrum of how we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, you know, people do just
very like, oh, I just had fast food the
[SPEAKER_01]: other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just once, it was twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad eats that shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's 82, healthy as shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so you never know what people's
constitutions are and what they can
[SPEAKER_01]: handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but for me personally, if I had
McDonald's one time, I would throw up
[SPEAKER_01]: probably and be sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a vegetarian or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with you wholeheartedly with,
it would make me sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have some something in Canada
called Clemato juice, which is like just
[SPEAKER_03]: tomato clam juice that we make,
that we make Caesar's with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, and there's nothing that it's like
a, you know, Bloody Mary, but it's Bloody
[SPEAKER_03]: Caesar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's nothing that I can tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like more on at a brunch or
anything than a beautiful, like I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: drink anymore because it kills me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the Bloody Caesar specifically,
there was so much MSG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, I just said, why am I doing
this to myself?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't had it in 20 years,
whatever it is, like I haven't had Clemato
[SPEAKER_03]: juice in 20 years because you know what
becomes, you know what, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's an addiction more than any other
for me in my life, feeling good,
[SPEAKER_03]: Alex, that's an addiction for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for everybody it is, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes so much discipline to eat
properly and not have that quick fix,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And to this day, I still do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like potato chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're organic potato chips,
but so what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't be eating all that sunflower
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still to this day, but it's the
same thing for exercise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, am I going to go do a hundred
pushups after this thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm going to do it, but I've got to
push myself and I've got to be strong and
[SPEAKER_01]: the same things for food.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you get into that pattern and
once you start to feel good and get that
[SPEAKER_01]: Chi going and get that connection with the
great spirit going or however you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: call it, you're just flowing, you're in
your space, you're right where you should
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that's addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's really feeling good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can have the quick fix or we can
have the, okay, I'm going to go take just
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 breaths.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to go do these 10 breaths
in concert, just on 10 breaths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that 10 breaths, you say,
God damn, 10 fucking breaths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all connected, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like what you said about when I
started smoking weed and I did it with
[SPEAKER_01]: health in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a very interesting thing
too, because everything we have to do has
[SPEAKER_01]: to be with health.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have our slips where humans were
not perfect, but this is the spiritual
[SPEAKER_01]: awakening of the earth is unless we're
tied in with some type of, we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: poisoned with all, whether it's our water
or our food or the information,
[SPEAKER_01]: or we're being controlled by all these
industrial complexes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always have been, it's not a conspiracy
theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just to what degree you think it's
happening and how you think it's playing
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's happening to just on
an empirical logical side, we are being
[SPEAKER_01]: exterminated, whether it's a conscious
effort or not, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you see, go to a grocery store
and you see what is considered to be food,
[SPEAKER_01]: you realize that something's gone awry in
our society big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who suffers from this?
[SPEAKER_01]: The poor and disenfranchised and they're
sitting there and have no chance to go get
[SPEAKER_01]: anything in their food deserts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's so easy for you to have one
to have money and be able to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I got mine, I got mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be actinually conscious of
what's going on, of the pain and suffering
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't mean we have to be
depressing or ruin our day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can still be optimistic and very happy,
but we have, as a Taoist, you have to have
[SPEAKER_01]: some type of consciousness of what,
of the whole picture, man, because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: also, what would you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: The middle path, Buddha says, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not a food Nazi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want anyone to do this or that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can do whatever the fuck they want,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not trying to mandate anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a free world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that middle path is so important for
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for healing, I think the middle path
is, I think we live in such a manic
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, yeah, fuck yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, selfie, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the laws of the universe say,
well, you're going to have those same lows
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the real happiness is that ribbon
in the middle where that nirvana of source
[SPEAKER_01]: resides.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not too high, not too low, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, you know, it's that's- It baby
bears porridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that is exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you- Oh, we're digressing,
aren't we?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, not at all, because I'll tell you,
not at all, not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are, I wasn't expecting,
not that I wasn't expecting, this to be so
[SPEAKER_03]: good, but I wasn't expecting it to go in
this direction because we are so aligned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Music saved me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like music, I know that cannabis helped to
heal me, but music saved me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I mean by saying that is I've
struggled with mental health.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to have an autoimmune
disease or any chronic illness and not
[SPEAKER_03]: struggle with mental health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, combining that with
watching a friend of mine die.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have still, you know, dreams of the
bloodstained docs at summer camp.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, my grandfather having died a
month before that, it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: when I was 13 years old and truly that
impacted my entire life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it wasn't until I went to this
school called the Jerome D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diamond Adolescent Center here in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a school of 30 kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was the eldest at 16.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was for kids that couldn't,
you know, hack it in the mainstream school
[SPEAKER_03]: system, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was social, emotional,
educational, you know, behavioral issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And music saved my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I had started to play guitar at
13.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally they said like, instead of,
you know, punching, it hurts a lot less
[SPEAKER_03]: for you to, instead of punching the wall,
why don't you just go pick up that
[SPEAKER_03]: instrument right there and play the
fucking guitar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember that one of the first songs
I learned like to really cry to and sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of be in the moment with was Wild Horses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, but, but I'll tell you,
like for me, it's just music, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, uh, Doobie said music is the doctor,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like music was the doctor for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The music that makes me cry is Bob Marley
and Jamiroquai.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, Jamiroquai is one of the all time
best ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like one of the most distinct
sounds and voices, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what makes it so unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: His voice is insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're just so funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like retro at the time
almost, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were bringing this little retro 70
sound in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they had their own thing, uh,
also, but yeah, music is very inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think it, I don't know if it saved
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always been a part of my life because
I grew up in a musical family,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, but it's a music is the,
it's, it's, it's such a beautiful art that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can express anywhere at any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, uh, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: People used to always say, wasn't it hard
being a white rapper, being a rapper who
[SPEAKER_01]: was white back in the, you know,
the early nineties or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, no, it was the best because as
an artist, you want to stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to differentiate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, was I getting,
Hey, that's why I switched to,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I switched to learn dance hall
because I'd be going up to big crowds that
[SPEAKER_01]: were all black and they'd just,
and I'd be wrapping my face off and they'd
[SPEAKER_01]: just, it'd just be all stone face in the
crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, who's this white boy up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Hmm, what up?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I win the crowd over?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started chanting dance hall,
Jamaican style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that became my secret weapon to get
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always had these little things in
music that I would like, it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was performing was,
it was always my favorite thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I performed all over, did all types of
crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, but how did it save you,
man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how, how, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, like, yeah, it absolutely did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, you know, I, I thought about
killing myself when I was very young.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, having this disease,
everyone thought, you know, there was
[SPEAKER_03]: always this misconception.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, even today, people look at
me and they're like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you got it so easy or, you know,
you're in this, you know, and you're this,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, come walk a mile brother,
you know, do what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, it's not, it's not,
I, I'm very specific in my social media to
[SPEAKER_03]: not curate something that says,
Hey, look at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not what it's about.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Hey, look at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking real.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can relate to me because I'm having a
really shit day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I struggle with mental health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what brother more often than
not, people resonate with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't resonate with the fact that my
sixth book is coming out in, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: where books are sold, you know,
in, in a couple of weeks, like no one
[SPEAKER_03]: resonates with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wrote it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like who's written a multiple books,
who has this really successful,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, ICBC amazing of show that
everybody wants to attend in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not many people can resonate with that
type of success, but they can resonate
[SPEAKER_03]: with our struggles, you know, being
arrested at the border and fucking,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, uh, Burlington, Vermont,
when I was going to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in college for a point three of a gram,
I don't even know if I've ever told that
[SPEAKER_03]: story on here, but the long and short of
it was I didn't get into trouble because
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an American citizen.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually only gave my buddies who
were Canadian citizens, all the hassle in
[SPEAKER_03]: the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but they confiscated the car for point
three of a gram of hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah, dude, it was fucking
brutal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, you know, it's that sort of
stuff where people just, you don't see,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they don't, they, it's like the
iceberg, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They only see what's above.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's like, that's so funny because
when I do these shows, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, I'm gonna go to Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be thousands of people
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it being king for a day because,
because my life here, I, I'm just a family
[SPEAKER_01]: man with my wife and my daughter and
they're breaking my balls all day long and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working and I'm just, you know,
it's not glorious, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's some great, I love my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk to people all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great, but it's not glory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always call it king for a day and
people are like, Oh my God, Alex,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always like, well, if you want to
work 15 hours a day for fucking 320 days,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, days out of the year, maybe you could
be king for a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm always, it's just so good to
stay humble and not get souped on,
[SPEAKER_01]: on, because once you do that, you know,
the gray spirit does not fucking like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know, you know, I,
I was on, uh, I told a story, I posted a
[SPEAKER_03]: story today, uh, on LinkedIn and I rarely,
you know, not rarely, that's not even fair
[SPEAKER_03]: now because I am using LinkedIn more and
more, but last week I received an email,
[SPEAKER_03]: the long and short of it is this,
I have a relationship with sick children's
[SPEAKER_03]: hospital here in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason I have a relationship is
because in my high school career,
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote every high school exam in the
hospital twice at sick children's
[SPEAKER_03]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I spent, you know, almost six months of
my life there as an inpatient.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always said, like, you know,
once I had the, the, the means to give
[SPEAKER_03]: back and it wasn't through money,
it was through raising funds and through
[SPEAKER_03]: my time that I wanted sick kids to be the
recipient of some of those, those efforts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started a relationship, I built a
relationship with packed pediatric
[SPEAKER_03]: advanced care team, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kids that are not going to live a
very long life and that are very sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one kid passed away, Corey Groves on
October 20th, uh, October 31st,
[SPEAKER_03]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was introduced to this young
man, Paul, who I didn't for whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: reason, I went to Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in Florida cooking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just, life got in the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went to reach out to his mom last
week and he passed away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, it's, it's that sort of give
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that sort of willingness to,
that's going to haunt me for the rest of
[SPEAKER_03]: my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I put it out there to everyone,
you know, so basically the point of me
[SPEAKER_03]: saying that was, and telling the story
this morning was seize the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the point, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be grateful and fucking thankful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so much pain and suffering in
the world that all this, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: judge each other and be pissy and,
and stand on pedestals.
[SPEAKER_01]: This garbage is the most, it's the most
hateful, racist, misogynistic,
[SPEAKER_01]: xenophobic attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I lost a buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He killed himself in 2021.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't take his artwork with them or
any of his money or anything like you,
[SPEAKER_03]: you, you take the impact that you've had
on other people with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such earthly problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people want to get all up in a dither
about, and it's just, and then you just
[SPEAKER_01]: know, there's so much, my mother passed
away for about four years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since that happened, you know,
it was about, you know, there's a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's extremely difficult,
but, uh, she was amazing and my best
[SPEAKER_01]: friend, but what it, it actually made me a
better person.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that pain, pain and suffering,
it makes you a better person.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are, if you're, uh, if you're,
if you're, if your chakras are open to
[SPEAKER_01]: receiving and giving like that,
your life it's moving because all that
[SPEAKER_01]: pain and suffering should just make one
have more patience, understanding and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding and tolerance for other,
other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the only direction we can,
we can go all this knee jerk fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: reductive rhetoric.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and, and, and, and, and it's
only the person that's espousing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's suffering, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I see some asshole out there in
Babylon, you know, it's just, I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh man, you are like, uh,
you know, I'll pray for you basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if he's a dick to me, I might punch
him in the face too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll walk away or I'll punch him and I'll
walk away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I have to, I'll punch him in the
face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause some people, you just get what
you're coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just get what's, what's just,
you're a dick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You deserved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on a higher level, it's like,
you know, you got to have love and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding, understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people need a little punch in the
face every now and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just kind of a wake up call,
whether it's metaphor, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: figurative or literal, uh, uh,
uh, you know, the things that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: complaining and talking and the greed,
the avarice, the impatience that's running
[SPEAKER_01]: our society right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just if, if you're a pussy,
if you're not a greedy, adverse,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, ristic motherfucker, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if avarice takes a word,
but I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, you're, you're a pussy,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're, if you're, if you're in
your swath, right, it's get or be got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're not animals, we're humans and
we get to make different, different,
[SPEAKER_01]: different choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people in charge with all these
wars, not just Putin, the West,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the fucking West wars also,
it's a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: These, we have children running the foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like eight year old, 10 year olds would
get on better than these, the adults in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, so here's the culture and the
narrative that's being foisted upon the
[SPEAKER_01]: kids today and whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're, we're missing the point where
people who are, are trying to be tolerant
[SPEAKER_01]: are the most intolerant people in the,
in the world these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shit is upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I have a lot of other opinions
on that also why that is, but we won't get
[SPEAKER_01]: into that, but the, the, the bottom line
is love, patience, tolerance,
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the time comes to get a punch in
the face, then you did your part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did your part until that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, I hope that there is,
you know, I, I, I, I subscribe to karma.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that you make your own success,
uh, working hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you said, you know, I've been speaking
to someone, uh, a lot of what I do is on a
[SPEAKER_03]: fractional basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, these days, I don't really want to
give anyone a hundred percent of my time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, when I explained to them,
you know, when you're probably
[SPEAKER_01]: unemployable anyway, Jordan, you're too
much your own person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I, I am, I, I'm definitely my brand and
I have my hands in a lot of pies.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but I have a team player and I love to
learn and I love to live.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no, there's no question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love to do those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, listen, you know,
I, I want to, I have to get back to the
[SPEAKER_03]: ICBC before we go on because we're going
to run out of time and I need to know
[SPEAKER_03]: what's next.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the ICBC because this thing has,
you know, if you haven't been,
[SPEAKER_03]: I highly suggest that you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there is nothing that I, I,
I certainly know what Spannabis is doing
[SPEAKER_03]: is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it was very clear to me where
the culture is, like how nascent it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's, you know, I,
I was with a lot of women and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, at Spannabis and ICBC, but Spannabis
specifically, and there was nothing and
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'm in the health and wellness
space too, I'm a little bit of a unicorn
[SPEAKER_03]: and that it's mostly women in the space
that I'm in and speaking to, there was
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing that spoke to our space at
Spannabis, zero nothing nada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, that was a missed opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought, um, Spannabis is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always, it's the longest running
consumer event.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always going to be what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always going to have its value and
utility.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the B2B thing in, in Europe is
blowing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we were the first B2B in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, uh, we're the biggest in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we're only in Europe now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since we, so I've been in Canada,
we ran the biggest B2B in Western Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: We run the longest running in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we, uh, but I, I eschewed all those
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to, uh, focus only on Europe,
because not only was that where our brand
[SPEAKER_01]: was blowing the fuck up, but it was where
I wanted to live and I want it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's where I actually enjoy doing
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: To tell you the truth, I'm really bored
when I do business in America and Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, you know, I don't know for what
reasons it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go to Europe and all of a sudden I'm
talking with all these different people
[SPEAKER_01]: and I, from different countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a little bit more
stimulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been through a lot, you know,
and I need a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do need my stimulation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, I can't, I have to be honest
with myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all my passion is in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're building in Europe right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we're not anywhere but Europe for
the next two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got, uh, and I'll announce an event,
uh, here that I haven't announced yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we have, uh, Berlin, we'll be in
Barcelona again, March 9th, the day before
[SPEAKER_01]: Spanavis again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, our big event is that we have the ICBC
Berlin coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the biggest B2B in Europe,
the 19th and 20th of July.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're expecting about 5,000 people and
we've got about 70,000 square feet of B2B
[SPEAKER_01]: expo space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's by far the largest B2B,
uh, event in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The day before that, we have the global
investment forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing this investment forum series of
these really high-end, schwanky events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one in Berlin at the Hotel Adlon and
then September 9th in Zurich, Switzerland
[SPEAKER_01]: at this little castle on the hill called
the Dolder Grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the pimpest hotel in the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so we're doing these small
high-end events also, but just for
[SPEAKER_01]: investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the new one I'm doing is I'm
doing the ICBC, this is what I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: announced yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing the ICBC Mediterranean
retreat, September 22nd and 23rd in a
[SPEAKER_01]: little town called Rovinj, Croatia at the
pimpest hotel in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like a bougie Rasta, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love going to these, like the
fanciest, nicest places, um, that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have as much pretension to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did it at the W once.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was too pretentious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love these nice places that aren't
pretentious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I searched for them in my own spare
time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just cause I want to go to these places
anyway, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found this place in Croatia,
Jordan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is insane, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the craziest shit ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not just saying that to tout,
to like the event, it's going to be only
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to sell the event out,
you know, but I'm saying this shit is so
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right on the sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Croatia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on this, it's like Rick Steve's
favorite town, Rovinj, and they just have
[SPEAKER_01]: this new hotel, the park, hotel,
like swimming, all these swimming pools of
[SPEAKER_01]: all these, it's like a six star hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the craziest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The food is all farm to table right at the
hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is absolutely in stunning, like move
over Greece, France, Italy, come to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Croatian Adriatic, and you'll be no more
good straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons I get these fancy
places is because of the stigma of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going into Croatia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very conservative there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if I rent the most expensive,
most pimp out hotel in the nation,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it helps me, just like I did for
Switzerland with the Dolder Grand,
[SPEAKER_01]: the finest hotel in Zurich, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like fine shit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a method to the madness.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go in and then we bring in people like
politicians from Croatia that they
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't be coming to do it if you were at
the Motel 6 or whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're at the baddest hotel in the
nation and then they're coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: representing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you heard it here first, the ICBC,
Mediterranean Retreat, Rovinj,
[SPEAKER_01]: Croatia, 22nd and 23rd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you talk about a couple of things have
resonated with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Empathy goes a very long way in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact is, is that for us,
what we're doing, having these
[SPEAKER_03]: conversations, you having these
conferences and renting higher end
[SPEAKER_03]: establishments and associating higher end
brands and higher end culture with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously the parallel is that's
what I do for a living.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately, it's about destigmatizing
the plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when people see someone like us,
whether creating, curating these
[SPEAKER_03]: experiences, eating my food and
recognizing that, holy shit, that brownie
[SPEAKER_03]: has cannabis and it has avocado and it has
coconut oil and almond flour and cacao in
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really good for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really fucking tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I can eat like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's all about destigmatizing
the organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll sort of, you know, for me,
the biggest opportunity, and I keep
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about this, the biggest
opportunity in cannabis, Alex,
[SPEAKER_03]: is from a set, especially from a CPG
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, are the people that don't
currently consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the biggest opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we bring them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're all kind of curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many people are really, really curious
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what they're not going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to grab the Ziggy's.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to grab the Ross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not going to give them flour and
say, go roll a joint or anything
[SPEAKER_03]: combustible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do it through food and
beverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the cool thing is, so I'm in
Oregon, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Southern Oregon, basically the one of the
weak capitals of the world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's nothing for me to teach anybody
here anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually helped revolutionize medical
marijuana here in the valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: I helped this valley tremendously,
became a strong community member and proud
[SPEAKER_01]: of my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now there's nothing there's no more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I'm in fucking Croatia,
where they're all like strict Catholics
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit and maybe associated with some
type of form of religious temperance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I am talking to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pride myself on engaging them and being
very clear and articulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like you say, you smoke weed
every day since I smoked weed every day
[SPEAKER_01]: since I was 12, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a magna cum, summa cum laude graduate
of political science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put my I'll put I'll put myself and
you know, I don't say that to tout myself
[SPEAKER_01]: or I say that to make this point that I'm
a full fucking stoner like of the utmost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I'm Euro trash now for since I
lived in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just smoke with tobacco and hash,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a more functional way to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like I'm doing big dab hits or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but it doesn't matter because
Europeans only smoke one way and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tell them all I smoke every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many of them are like, Yeah,
really?
[SPEAKER_01]: You Alex, you seem you seem so clear and
on top of it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, don't believe the hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the you know, that's that that
love pushing that message to people and be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, surprise, surprise, motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a freak, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the most professional on top of the
freak you ever met.
[SPEAKER_03]: I functioning pothead.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's that's how I refer to
myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can conduct a podcast, you know,
before I come on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've smoked a joint before we came on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, since I woke up and before I
worked out, I mean, it just it's part of
[SPEAKER_03]: what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's part of my namaste.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a headstand and I'm high and I can
zone out and I can be on my spin by I can
[SPEAKER_03]: really get into a zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, that's it's for me is it's just
part of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how I treat myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how it's my medicine and it's how I
stay focused and become and maintain or or
[SPEAKER_03]: really once I found my mental health
through my physical health, I became a
[SPEAKER_03]: much more right game, much better father
and husband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way better for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, cannabis, when I started
to realize that, you know, it wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: because I was only, you know, a dead head
or, you know, it was because I needed it
[SPEAKER_03]: to survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it took me decades to realize.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like you said, well, Jack Heron
never smoked weed till he was 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people don't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but like you said, there's an
application for everybody, like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: all these curious people and there's an
application for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some people just don't want to smoke
and get high on THC smoking joint.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just don't like the feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's still an application for them
to use cannabis, whether it's a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: micro edible or whether it's a lotion or
topical or whatever the fuck it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's it might be a certain time
where they might have a certain ailment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then they only use it then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my wife doesn't smoke at all ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when she gets sciatica pain,
she takes a puff off that vape maybe once
[SPEAKER_01]: or twice a year only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she said it helps you go to sleep and
it helps you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's a total nut pothead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could put terpenes or you put
terpenes into a diffuser.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, something as simple as that,
you know, something as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that misconception that cannabis,
cannabis equals getting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so in Europe, see how exciting it is
for me because it's still so stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_01]: You thought of like it's like you thought
of like some lazy, lazy loser still and
[SPEAKER_01]: those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really a big threat, even in
Germany or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just starting to crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say I'm a little part of crushing
that glass ceiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go on for hours with you, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't I wasn't expecting that for us to
have this amazing camaraderie.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has been incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if people want to be a part of ICBC,
go to ICBC, present at ICBC, how do they
[SPEAKER_03]: get in touch?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested in the if they're
interested in coming to Europe and having
[SPEAKER_01]: the most phenomenal experience of all time
on a B2B cannabis level, just visit the
[SPEAKER_01]: website InternationalCBC.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody wants to hit me up directly,
I'm super accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alex at InternationalCBC.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just hit me up and yeah,
whatever's clever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We welcome all the good vibrations.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of these days, we will do a we'll get
some food and beverage content into some
[SPEAKER_03]: of these shows that I think that would be
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm down, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've I've already helped some people
do a lot of stuff with their food and
[SPEAKER_01]: beverage over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I love and that's the first
thing when when this one guy wanted to pop
[SPEAKER_01]: through and rock his shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wanted to put a CB drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I got to see the ingredients,
because if you got some Babylonian
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients there, I'm not and he didn't
actually actually was natural enough for
[SPEAKER_01]: me to be like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was going to deny him for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it didn't have refined sugar and it
didn't have all this other crazy,
[SPEAKER_01]: weird shit in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, but it was like the
one that didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I'm down for you,

[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I can go to the fascist
state of Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but but I but but I love I love
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the most beautiful country in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in the Canada of America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I I can even talk like a Canadian
because Minnesotans and Canadians talk a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit like, you know, it's like this
Norwegian Native American influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're you're an absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure I am sure the audience love this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want you to know the ICBC has had
now two full podcasts worth of content on
[SPEAKER_03]: my platform, because that's how much I
loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how much you impacted me and my other
colleagues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And quite frankly, I've already monetized
as a result of being at the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: I and I every time Jedi and I 100 percent,

[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't wait to spend some time with
you in person to all the listeners out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to give some love very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been negligent and I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: The joy of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seventy five ways to amplify your life
through the science and magic of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Melanie Abrams and Larry Smith.
[SPEAKER_03]: I contributed to this book this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: The art of cooking with cannabis,
CBD and THC infused recipes from across
[SPEAKER_03]: America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tracy Medeiros had amazing collection of
culinary and contribute to this book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me representing Canada, a and that was
actually nominated for People's Choice
[SPEAKER_03]: Award.
[SPEAKER_03]: So congratulations, Tracy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a big week for me in that I got
a big spread of kind magazine,
[SPEAKER_03]: my brothers and, you know, Shabazz and
Josh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, fucking fried chicken.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one just looks bomb.
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you so much for the opportunity
to kind magazine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the first time, High Times
featured one of my recipes, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: really cool in their 420 edition or 420
issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's really exciting about it for me
is I've spent the last seven years really
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of building this narrative about what
cannabis food and beverage can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to see my signature dish where I used
to create signature dishes that were 1520
[SPEAKER_03]: different items into a dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now this one signature dish,
chicken, kale, meatballs with infused
[SPEAKER_03]: cherry tomato sauce has all the four
ingredients in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just goes to show you, you buy the
best ingredients you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do very little to them and you serve
them to those that you love.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is great food.
[SPEAKER_03]: So high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for your support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everyone, for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I say, always, if you are
struggling with mental health,
[SPEAKER_03]: my DMs are always open.
[SPEAKER_03]: People contact me all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am one hell of a listener.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do one thing in this life,
my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing we can positively impact people
by being a good person, be a good human.
