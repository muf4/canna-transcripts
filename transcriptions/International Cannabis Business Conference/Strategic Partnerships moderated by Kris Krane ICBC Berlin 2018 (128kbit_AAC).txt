try to do so as best as I can and hope
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not too disappointed that he's not
speaking himself Thank you Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're a German company we're based in
southern Germany in a small town called
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuttlingen where we manufacture medical
Cannabis vaporizers so the volcano for
[SPEAKER_00]: example another example is the mighty
which is also medically certified both are
[SPEAKER_00]: certified in Europe in Canada and in

[SPEAKER_00]: that's it About the company.

[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the person who is most in contact
with patients with pharmacies with you
[SPEAKER_00]: know All the stuff that is really
complicated right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in Germany, but it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Thank you Chris, what's your Hi Chris
bunker.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the chairman and CEO of Luxaria
Bioscience Corp We're a publicly traded
[SPEAKER_08]: company in Canada in the United States
have offices both in Canada and the US we
[SPEAKER_08]: work on edible forms edible and topical
forms of absorption and improving the
[SPEAKER_08]: characteristics of cannabis and other
drugs as well To get them into your
[SPEAKER_08]: bloodstream more predictably generally
speaking more enjoyably and much more
[SPEAKER_08]: quickly than Is otherwise possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what we built our business on.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking to companies In many
countries around the world about licensing
[SPEAKER_03]: our technology and that is that is what we
do And Vincent, my name is Vincent Yacolti
[SPEAKER_03]: co-founder of show products.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're based out of Los Angeles,
California We're most known for our rosin
[SPEAKER_03]: tech products line of products,
but we also manufacture poly masters
[SPEAKER_03]: electric now damnation is one of our
brands also And show industries we like to
[SPEAKER_03]: say we're the world leader in salmonella
extraction equipment and supplies for the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry It's basically the wrap on my
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're here to talk about strategic
partnerships I think it's fairly safe to
[SPEAKER_02]: say that in any industry you're going to
need partnerships.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to need vendor relationships
And so I'll throw this out to the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: panel How important are strategic
partnerships in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_02]: relative to any other initiatives?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this just like Another widget or being
a manufacturer other widget or is there
[SPEAKER_02]: other unique?
[SPEAKER_02]: Aspects to forming partnerships in this
industry that you all have encountered.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Mean, I think in any industry strategic
partnerships are definitely vital but now
[SPEAKER_03]: in the cannabis industry Specifically
because of the rapid pace that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: moving at if you try to go at this alone
in any capacity You're gonna find it's
[SPEAKER_03]: very very tough to keep up It's tough to
keep up as it is right now in this rapid
[SPEAKER_03]: worldwide industry that we're in so
finding strategic alliances and people
[SPEAKER_03]: that share the same vision you view is Is
a key role to I think success in this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I Totally agree and as well because of the
regulatory environment that's both Newly
[SPEAKER_08]: emerging and shifting all over the place
So as you as I'm sure you're aware in
[SPEAKER_08]: America, for example, every state has
different rules and regulatory environment
[SPEAKER_08]: which means that companies that are trying
to operate operate in a National or a
[SPEAKER_08]: quasi national format need to do so
through strategic partners in other states
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis the cannabis laws in the United
States are such that Obviously,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's still federally illegal, but even
where it is legal at the state level a
[SPEAKER_08]: corporation for example that is
incorporated say in the state of
[SPEAKER_08]: California is not permitted to do business
in the state of Colorado needs to be owned
[SPEAKER_08]: and operated generally speaking with In
each state now there are exceptions to
[SPEAKER_08]: that but partnering is very very important
for the regulatory reasons it's also
[SPEAKER_08]: really important as the industry is
growing up right before your eyes because
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody everybody around the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just Germany.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody starts by selling flour That's
where it starts.
[SPEAKER_08]: It starts with medical and starts with
flour, but that is not where it finishes
[SPEAKER_08]: it finishes with consumer products and
Just because somebody is really good at
[SPEAKER_08]: growing a plant doesn't mean they know or
don't think about how to make soda pop or
[SPEAKER_08]: chocolate bar or a cookie or anything else
that you might want to consume So you're
[SPEAKER_08]: seeing a lot of developments nationally
and internationally with consumer products
[SPEAKER_08]: companies tobacco companies everybody
knows about Constellation brands having
[SPEAKER_08]: written a big check to a Canadian company
Constellation of course is an alcohol
[SPEAKER_08]: company so it's the the partnering between
the expertise levels in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: sector and As well as in the consumer
products sectors that we think is where
[SPEAKER_08]: you're going to see most of the strategic
partnering as well as to meet the regional
[SPEAKER_02]: jurisdictional demands We talk about we
talk we talk about the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_02]: as if it's an industry But really there's
it's farming its lab tech right its
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction There's all sorts of facets of
it and it's you in the United States at
[SPEAKER_02]: least in numbers in a number of states
We've required these businesses to become
[SPEAKER_02]: vertically integrated and it's like asking
somebody to be an expert in all sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: things It's like saying you're gonna open
a clothing store You also have to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: cotton farmer, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really happen in other
industries And so as this develops it's
[SPEAKER_02]: inevitable that you're gonna have to form
these types of partnerships In order to be
[SPEAKER_02]: successful because it's gonna come down to
more and more specialization and nobody's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna really be an expert in Everything
right if you are you're gonna be a
[SPEAKER_02]: consultant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably not gonna be an operator
But you brought up a really good point
[SPEAKER_02]: about the need to partner in the United
States at least You know every state has
[SPEAKER_02]: very different laws different regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to get licenses My company is a
multi-state operator And we can't just go
[SPEAKER_02]: into a new state on our own and be a
carpet bagger I don't know for the
[SPEAKER_02]: Europeans if you're all familiar with the
term carpet bagger, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it basically means you're going in and
you're trying to do business in somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: else's turf without having any ties to
that community You can't win a license in
[SPEAKER_02]: most places as a pure park carpet bagger
You have to find a good local strategic
[SPEAKER_02]: partner that understands the political
environment that understands the business
[SPEAKER_02]: climate Or you have virtually no chance of
getting into that market I'd be curious
[SPEAKER_02]: from the panel how you've seen that apply
so far to you Europe or this isn't it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not a state-by-state market, but certainly
these will be country-by-country markets
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you think for what your thoughts
are for businesses that are looking to
[SPEAKER_02]: expand into Europe or start in Europe And
their ability to do so with or without
[SPEAKER_02]: really solid local partners in the
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking to work in Our company is
ancillary so it's a little different
[SPEAKER_03]: because we we don't have to deal with the
same legalities but being ancillary it's
[SPEAKER_03]: essential for us to partner with Actual
companies touching the cannabis product
[SPEAKER_03]: because without the companies actually
touching the cannabis products We can't do
[SPEAKER_03]: any development or R&D or testing on our
products So to touch on how that's worked
[SPEAKER_03]: in the states and going into Europe is I
think it's a it's pretty much impossible
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said even on the state level in
the US to enter Into these new markets on
[SPEAKER_03]: your own, but it's also even harder coming
from the US trying to enter Europe
[SPEAKER_03]: European market because the culture is
even more different and there's there's
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely a bigger sense of nationalism
here also so coming in from the US to the
[SPEAKER_03]: European I think a good piece of advice
would be to find people that once again
[SPEAKER_03]: share your vision that you have from US or
the markets you're in and Follow them
[SPEAKER_00]: through to the European market Yeah,
I agree so of course you cannot do that on
[SPEAKER_00]: your own you have to find the matching
partners and I think that I mean most of
[SPEAKER_00]: us are here today to do to do so so we're
basically we're going into the markets
[SPEAKER_00]: we're attending conferences like this and
trade shows like this where we find those
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you know and where we can we can
talk to each other we can share our
[SPEAKER_00]: visions as you said to and So I think
platforms like these enable us to to to do
[SPEAKER_02]: so to find the people that we want to work
with to this particularly for Vatra and
[SPEAKER_02]: Vince and Vincent you guys are both on the
ancillary side of the primarily on the
[SPEAKER_02]: ancillary side of the business Do you
think it's more or less important in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of how you vet the folks you're gonna work
with like you can have vendor
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships with folks who aren't
necessarily a Partner, but what are the
[SPEAKER_02]: downsides to choosing the sort of choosing
the wrong partners in the ancillary side
[SPEAKER_02]: of the business and how you know how much
do you do in terms of vetting who you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do business with sell your
products to Well, it's it's important to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to not commit yourself too early You
have to really I mean, of course you can
[SPEAKER_00]: you can always make a mistake and choose a
wrong partner I think there you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to back out as soon as your gut tells
you to But in general the the advice here
[SPEAKER_00]: is is to try to not you know, make
contracts really binding contracts that
[SPEAKER_00]: could Ruin it for for your company and
make it very difficult to get out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: contract like this So I can I can speak
for our for ourselves because we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: on the market for quite a while we While
we keep the contracts at least in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning really lose and Try to to build
up a relationship of trust with the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that we work with and then decide based on
you know The past couple of years couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of months, you know try try and see how
how we work together and then maybe Get
[SPEAKER_00]: into a real serious business relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Just to touch on that quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think like just not signing
exclusive deals right now as ancillary
[SPEAKER_03]: companies is A big thing because the
markets are changing every day companies
[SPEAKER_03]: go in and out of business You don't want
to be locked to one person You can have a
[SPEAKER_03]: verbal exclusive agreement where you if
you think they're gonna live up to it that
[SPEAKER_03]: you can move forward in that manner and
just not contractually bind yourself and
[SPEAKER_03]: see if you both work together and you can
live up to your end of the bargain and
[SPEAKER_03]: they can live up to their end of the
bargain before you actually contractualize
[SPEAKER_02]: that and Chris on the on the non ancillary
side I mean you're with your business is
[SPEAKER_02]: fairly unique in that it sounds to me and
forgive me I don't I don't I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: intimately familiar with the business,
but it sounds to me like you're you're a
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing play, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're you're you're licensing your
Technology to manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done something you're not going out
and winning licenses in every state in the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna find license holders and
you're gonna license that technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really you know, that's really hard
to do on a short-term basis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to just dance with
somebody without you know, jump,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know jumping in full-time So how do
you go about the vetting process to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that you don't wind up in a long-term
partnership relationship with someone that
[SPEAKER_02]: You ultimately don't want to work with
because those are those are much those are
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty messy to untangle These are they
are really you're right.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are really difficult It's sort of
like getting married every time over and
[SPEAKER_08]: over and over again Our sales cycle is
traditionally 6 to 18 months it takes us 6
[SPEAKER_08]: to 18 months to close a single client
because we work with manufacturers of
[SPEAKER_08]: consumer products and so we're working
with chocolate companies and beer
[SPEAKER_08]: companies and wine companies and protein
bar and protein drinks and all sorts of
[SPEAKER_08]: different products that you can imagine
and We work with their food formulators
[SPEAKER_08]: and their biochemists and we have to make
sure that things work So there's round
[SPEAKER_08]: after round after round of formulating and
testing We do clinical trials right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is April, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the last three and a half months,
we've completed a Rodent nicotine
[SPEAKER_08]: absorption study.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've completed a skin absorption study in
San Francisco We're entering into a human
[SPEAKER_08]: clinical study on CBD in a capsule format
in Eastern Europe that actually started
[SPEAKER_08]: this week We're in the middle of a
two-year research and development program
[SPEAKER_08]: with the government federal government of
Canada So we have a lot of different
[SPEAKER_08]: things going on and the partnerships for
Finished goods are really really complex
[SPEAKER_08]: because you also have to comply with the
regulatory environment in every country
[SPEAKER_08]: for that food product So when we think
about our strategic partnering from Lex
[SPEAKER_08]: Aria, we really We include the cannabis
industry growers and cannabis products
[SPEAKER_08]: manufacturers, but for us it includes
beverage companies alcohol companies
[SPEAKER_08]: tobacco companies pharmaceutical companies
because our technology is applicable to
[SPEAKER_08]: nicotine delivery and vitamins and pain
relief and other things so it's a it's an
[SPEAKER_08]: integral part of our business not a single
day goes by when we're not working on one
[SPEAKER_08]: partnering agreement or another one and
Quite frankly if we weren't good at it,
[SPEAKER_08]: we wouldn't survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to do it every single day Yeah,
it's I mean it is a challenge like we face
[SPEAKER_02]: this as well as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're multi-state operators so we'll go
into another state we'll try and find a
[SPEAKER_02]: You know somebody in that state who's who
offers something, you know tangible that
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't have local connections local real
estate a real connection They're all tied
[SPEAKER_02]: a local community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally, they're gonna come into
minority partner position And we've done a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of these in consulting deals where we
have sort of long-term consulting
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships and one of the things that
we found is There's often not time when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're building these relationships to
really vet somebody over the long run
[SPEAKER_02]: before you have to commit to doing this
right we're gonna apply for a license
[SPEAKER_02]: together you got to form a company and you
know to analogize this to to You know real
[SPEAKER_02]: life or the dating world, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like generally, you know when you first
start dating somebody like everything's
[SPEAKER_02]: great and rosy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone you they're the perfect
everything's great about them,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everything seems wonderful But you
don't marry that person before you get in
[SPEAKER_02]: your first fight or your first argument,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's when you that's when
people's true colors come out and
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly in this world We find once you
start getting into the weeds and things
[SPEAKER_02]: you start getting into the heat of an
application process is just really
[SPEAKER_02]: Stressful and people are operating on you
know, four three to four hours of sleep a
[SPEAKER_02]: night That's when you really see how it is
to work with someone and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_02]: you find yourself in a situation We're
like, wow, I got to work with this person
[SPEAKER_02]: for the next ten years Like what did I
just get myself into?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess my this is a lead-in for the
whole panel is I'd be interested if you
[SPEAKER_02]: could give Some you know without without
throwing anyone under the bus or maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: giving names If you could talk about some
experiences that you've had of
[SPEAKER_02]: partnerships gone poorly And what you've
done to untangle those relationships with
[SPEAKER_02]: the least amount of stress and brain
damage My industry is kind of niche.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get into these stories
Come on now that's a cop-out You don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to identify.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, we're a public company.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no way I'm identifying I Think I
would I would just amalgamate a number of
[SPEAKER_08]: different experiences and characters So
that it's easier to hide I'll give one
[SPEAKER_08]: example.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were so our technology works by
Enhancing the delivery of an API an active
[SPEAKER_08]: pharmaceutical ingredient.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that can be THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an API to us Enhancing the delivery
and getting that molecule into your
[SPEAKER_08]: bloodstream at the end of the day If it
doesn't get into your bloodstream,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not going to do any good.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we do so We've been approached
by a company in California And took the
[SPEAKER_08]: call and they were a leading a leading
force a well-known company private in in
[SPEAKER_08]: California one of the biggest companies in
their particular niche So this is a
[SPEAKER_08]: company that's probably selling I'm gonna
guess 60 to maybe 90 million dollars a
[SPEAKER_08]: year.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably their revenue and Our
president John he flies down starts to go
[SPEAKER_08]: to work in their factory working on
formulations and the second day the
[SPEAKER_08]: president of the company comes in and he's
trying to get an idea exactly what we're
[SPEAKER_08]: doing and we're showing how to improve the
delivered delivery of the THC through
[SPEAKER_08]: their Through their product And we're
going through the whole process and John
[SPEAKER_08]: says to him Well, this is how you're going
to deliver about three times more THC than
[SPEAKER_08]: through the process.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been using that's a lot,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: So instead of delivering Maybe 10
milligrams of THC your customer is
[SPEAKER_08]: actually going to experience The
equivalent of 30 it's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the question from the president of this
other company to us was He looks kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: worried and he says well Well,
that's all well and good but if you're
[SPEAKER_08]: enhancing the absorption of the THC are
you also enhancing the absorption of the
[SPEAKER_08]: pesticides and You know, we had to stop
for a second And we kind of looked at each
[SPEAKER_08]: other like well, how do you answer that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right because the answer is well if
there's any pesticides in your product
[SPEAKER_08]: You're breaking the law as well as you're
a real asshole If you know that it's there
[SPEAKER_08]: and you're delivering that to your
customers the reality in California is
[SPEAKER_08]: that independent studies over and over and
over again pre January 1 Showed that over
[SPEAKER_08]: 90% of all the cannabis sold on the street
or through dispensaries in the state of
[SPEAKER_08]: California before regulation is
contaminated with pesticides herbicides or
[SPEAKER_08]: heavy metals So, you know, there is a very
genuine question coming from somebody who
[SPEAKER_08]: could be an industrial partner to us
Worrying that he's going to poison his
[SPEAKER_08]: consumers more than he's already poisoning
them So we said thank you very much and
[SPEAKER_08]: goodbye and you know that Was the end of
that relationship?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just an example of where it can
go.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean it can be really uncomfortable
Really really quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a story for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right The moral of the story is as
you're starting out don't get bullied by
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger companies Great point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some companies out there will know that
you're starting out and some people out
[SPEAKER_03]: there Are willing to take advantage of
those type of situations in that in our
[SPEAKER_03]: Position me and my co-founder Sam my
partner We were starting out it was about
[SPEAKER_03]: we were about a year and a half into
business and we're at the point if we're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna raise capital if we're gonna take on
more partners if we want to do a buyout we
[SPEAKER_03]: were where we're an ancillary company we
had We had positive revenue positive cash
[SPEAKER_03]: cash flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were profitable so we were attractive
to people investing in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry especially because people didn't
want to necessarily touch the plan or Not
[SPEAKER_03]: so we were approached with a certain deal
by a very well-known company in the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry and that's what we'll say and
they they they wanted to buy us out and
[SPEAKER_03]: they wanted to add a product division to
their already existing company and We were
[SPEAKER_03]: really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't you be they're really
well-known company we want to do it but
[SPEAKER_03]: then We sit down at a table and the deal
you're presented and then you get back to
[SPEAKER_03]: your lawyers and the deal That's in the
contract is a totally different deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what that happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even respond we were done with
the deal You don't sit and like if
[SPEAKER_03]: someone's gonna lie to your face like that
And then it's one thing if the wording is
[SPEAKER_03]: a little different because the lawyers got
involved But if it's a completely
[SPEAKER_03]: different deal, I would just walk away at
that point Yeah, I mean it's a great point
[SPEAKER_02]: be Be really careful when signing
contracts Particularly if you're newer and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're starting out and you're dealing
with with folks or companies that are a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot more established we've seen a lot of
entrepreneurs small business owners get
[SPEAKER_02]: Just badly screwed over because they
didn't really understand the count stand
[SPEAKER_02]: the contracts use a good contractual
attorney There are a lot of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: attorneys who can be very good at
understanding regulate regulations But I
[SPEAKER_02]: found a lot of cannabis attorneys tend to
try and do more than what's outside their
[SPEAKER_02]: area of expertise You really want a good
contracts lawyer or good business lawyer
[SPEAKER_02]: to look over those contracts before you
sign them and I'll give an example here
[SPEAKER_02]: also the nameless company, but we got a
whole got a hold of an operating agreement
[SPEAKER_02]: of a This was a dispensary operation where
the investors who were quite sophisticated
[SPEAKER_02]: and had been around for a while signed an
operating agreement with the folks who had
[SPEAKER_02]: originally won the license and they
created which is very common, you know two
[SPEAKER_02]: classes of shares for the founders and for
the investors and usually there's more
[SPEAKER_02]: protections for the investors which makes
sense to protect your money, but they
[SPEAKER_02]: basically created across a class of shares
where the Original shareholders could be
[SPEAKER_02]: removed for cause for all these different
reasons, right or if they're a subject of
[SPEAKER_02]: a criminal investigation and then the You
know the investors could never be removed
[SPEAKER_02]: for any reason including cause and you
know and then later and we've and we've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen this is a game you see some folks
play where then they will they will start
[SPEAKER_02]: a criminal investigation against their
partners against some out, you know for
[SPEAKER_02]: some allegation and use that as an
opportunity to remove them from the
[SPEAKER_02]: company and take the whole company,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just one example where we've seen
a lot of these types of games particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: from some of the less ethical Wall Street
veterans Who you know think that they can
[SPEAKER_02]: use their money to basically take what
they want rather than forming a strategic
[SPEAKER_02]: partnership.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if this is something you guys
have encountered, but I think that's a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is something that you know
folks need to be really wary of You know
[SPEAKER_02]: when dealing with you know big money
players particularly those who are new to
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh Yeah, I mean if there's a universal
piece of advice look, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm I'm I'm almost 60 years old I've been
business a long long time in a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: different sectors in different countries
Do not try to save money by not using a
[SPEAKER_08]: good law firm.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just don't do it don't even think about
doing it right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have five different law firms that are
Regularly engaged by us ones for
[SPEAKER_08]: intellectual property ones for cannabis
law Contract law all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_08]: things and I don't like spending money I
don't like wasting money but a good
[SPEAKER_08]: contract and understanding what it what
what it is that you're signing and Making
[SPEAKER_08]: sure that you're asking for the thing that
you think you're asking for and you're not
[SPEAKER_08]: asking for something completely different
Because you use the wrong word.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen it one wrong word in a sentence
Understand your grammar Understand what it
[SPEAKER_08]: is that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really important contract laws very
important So we're we've got about five
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes left here and I want to open it up
for any quick quick audience questions
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it again for the panel too,
by the way, very informative Always be
[SPEAKER_05]: careful who you work with humans are all
humans you
[SPEAKER_01]: So My question is kind of like a
follow-up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um It's very careful to go out there and
do your diligence on both sides,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely and how are some of the clever
non legal ways to do due diligence That
[SPEAKER_01]: you might I mean it is important to have a
lawyer But what are the common sense
[SPEAKER_01]: things that you would suggest as a panel
with international experience because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're other gotchas I Would vet the
people that you're going to business by
[SPEAKER_03]: other people they've done business with a
pattern of behavior holds true a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: time so Credibility like build their
credibility through the there ask them for
[SPEAKER_03]: some References some people that they work
with see who they do business with because
[SPEAKER_03]: who did they do business with has a lot to
say what?
[SPEAKER_03]: That what they have to say About them has
a lot to say about their character and how
[SPEAKER_02]: they're gonna do business with you moving
forward Run a background check Yeah to
[SPEAKER_08]: hire somebody to do a background check if
you've got hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_08]: dollars look I'm a venture capitalist for
almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've written checks to hundreds of
companies in my career Check them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: How much money are you spending?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you spending nothing?
[SPEAKER_08]: But your whole life is at risk your
business something you've worked on for 20
[SPEAKER_08]: years check them out Spend the money talk
to their customers and talk to the
[SPEAKER_08]: customers and find out what they like and
what they hate Yeah, one thing one thing I
[SPEAKER_02]: found I found helpful is to ask potential
partners You know tell me about business
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship that's gone wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's had them It doesn't necessarily
mean that they've done wrong or that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're you know unethical, but you know
tell me about a relationship That's gone
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: What went wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you handle the situation and can I
talk to the person on the other side of
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right and oftentimes I mean we'll do
that obviously talk to people who've been
[SPEAKER_02]: in business disputes, and I'll look at
both sides and say yeah I'm comfortable
[SPEAKER_02]: with the way that went down like business
disputes happen It doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: mean that these are unethical bad people
But it's good to understand the disputes
[SPEAKER_02]: that people have been in and how they
resolve those situations how folks are
[SPEAKER_04]: feeling about it after the fact Good
evening pal, do you foresee?
[SPEAKER_04]: The rules in the states changing to export
products into other countries I do,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's I mean try to put a time frame on
that It's impossible right I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually Federal prohibition the United
States has to end You know I'm sure I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't like using the inevitable word
Because I think that disincentivizes
[SPEAKER_02]: people to get involved in advocacy and
activism to make this happen If people
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's inevitable right there less
incentivized to get involved, but we are
[SPEAKER_02]: at over 60% support publicly This is legal
now in a lot of swing states in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States can be much more difficult for
presidential Candidates moving forward to
[SPEAKER_02]: Tote the line on legalization,
so I think we're eventually going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: there and when that happens The US
eventually does I think open up for for
[SPEAKER_02]: export The question is whether in my mind
really is whether the United States is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be the most efficient place to
produce Low-cost product or whether that's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to start moving to producer
countries with much lower cost of
[SPEAKER_02]: production I think it's going to be a
combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going to take a while open
question I think those are excellent
[SPEAKER_08]: comments.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would actually split the question into
two though Because I think you're going to
[SPEAKER_08]: have a different answer on on Cannabis and
you are in hemp and and the wave that's
[SPEAKER_08]: hitting America right now listen where we
buy hemp oil That's one of the things we
[SPEAKER_08]: do and we've been buying it for years I
have watched the price of CBD and hemp oil
[SPEAKER_08]: drop from 16 to 17 cents a milligram about
three and a half years ago It's currently
[SPEAKER_08]: around 1.1 cent That is more than a 90%
reduction and it is going to drop a ton
[SPEAKER_08]: this year because For the first time in
American history modern American history
[SPEAKER_08]: you're going to have tens of thousands of
acres of Hemp grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's being planted right now in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be harvested this summer and
fall the American farm Advocacy groups are
[SPEAKER_08]: very very very strong I'll bet you you
will see hemp and CBD being exported from
[SPEAKER_08]: the United States two to four years THC I
think is quite a bit further down the road
[SPEAKER_03]: All I have is that I agree with maybe we
mo us might not be the Best economic place
[SPEAKER_03]: to be growing cannabis people are starting
to look at South America West Africa other
[SPEAKER_03]: places that might be cheaper labor and
cheaper energy cost to grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, but we still do grow the
best cannabis for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes Excited I didn't mean to be so loud,
but so yeah, but that's the thing like I
[SPEAKER_05]: think we're out of time But I would love
to talk about the commodity Versus the
[SPEAKER_05]: craft aspect because your first thing is
like well, we can always do it for the
[SPEAKER_05]: lower price But is that always the better
way?
[SPEAKER_03]: For extraction versus Indoor small batch
craft will be living in United States,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's a higher price point for for that
crop It's the two different products at
[SPEAKER_05]: the end of the day people buy fancy beer
from Germany in America all the time So we
[SPEAKER_06]: will see thank you all very much for the
panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you everybody
