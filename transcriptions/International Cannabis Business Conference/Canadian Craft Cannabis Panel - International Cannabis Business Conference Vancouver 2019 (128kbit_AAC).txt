[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had planned to be on for an hour,
but we have half an hour, so I would
[SPEAKER_02]: encourage all of you to read our speakers'
bios on the app, because the wealth of
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge and the years of experience we
have, both from the craft perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: the regulatory perspective, but helping
build industry in this new legalized
[SPEAKER_02]: regime, we are very blessed to have these
three people with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have beside me here Joel Prodowski,
Travis Lane, and David Herford.
[SPEAKER_02]: All three of them we have relied on at
both Grotech Labs and at Niche Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: the National Institute for Cannabis Health
and Education, because one of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm a very strong advocate for is not
only education, but communications that
[SPEAKER_02]: provides an opportunity to tie government,
industry, health, professional
[SPEAKER_02]: associations, all into the mix so people
actually understand how we can get to a
[SPEAKER_02]: place in Canada we were fully utilizing
and realizing the benefits of legalizing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we have now with the craft industry,
I think, from somebody who is an outsider
[SPEAKER_02]: and has not only been educated by these
three and other people in industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the realization that our present
government at all three levels is viewing
[SPEAKER_02]: the craft industry, A, with a bit of
hesitation, but also in some cases as a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of a problem, versus what they should
be viewing the craft industry as,
[SPEAKER_02]: is a solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: A solution to the issues that we see
around quality, the issues around supply,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the issues around economic development
and job creation for our province and for
[SPEAKER_02]: our country.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't wanna take up too much of your
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm first gonna ask each one of the
panelists to take a brief one minute
[SPEAKER_02]: introduction to talk about some of the
things that they see happening with the
[SPEAKER_02]: craft industry here in BC and Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joel?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Joel Podersky, co-founder of the
Craft Cannabis Association of British
[SPEAKER_06]: Columbia, co-founder of Cascadia
Agricultural Cooperative Association.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the dynamics that I see going on
in the craft industry is a regulatory
[SPEAKER_06]: environment that is very stifling to the
industry, a lot of miscommunication on all
[SPEAKER_06]: three levels of government, municipal,
land use bylaws, and we've been doing our
[SPEAKER_06]: best to try and educate, and I feel like
having conversation and getting more
[SPEAKER_06]: people involved in the conversation and
telling their governments as well is part
[SPEAKER_06]: of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Travis Lane.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an organic cannabis grower,
and I've applied for licenses with Health
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been growing for 15 to 20 years,
which is pretty much half my life,
[SPEAKER_03]: and not always as a professional,
sometimes in a closet, sometimes in the
[SPEAKER_03]: one bedroom in my one bedroom apartment,
and more recently on a more industrial
[SPEAKER_03]: scale and with the ability to do some data
accumulation and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk regulations for small
business people that are bootstrapping it,
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously there have been added costs and
added risks that come from some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations that have been created on a
federal scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really the big hurdle that we've had to
jump when we've been looking to apply for
[SPEAKER_03]: licensing with our small facilities has
been regional.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about getting zoning, making sure
that there's water and power, making sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that the local regional district is
willing to accept you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now we've just gotten to the point
where we've jumped a lot of those hurdles
[SPEAKER_03]: in BC.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ALR decisions that have been made in
the past have really held up a lot as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think we're going to see the
first waves of micros, but I think that
[SPEAKER_03]: small business people that are
bootstrapping an operation cannot afford
[SPEAKER_03]: to wait for a long, long time to be
licensed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my hope is that we see a
proliferation of these licenses at speed
[SPEAKER_03]: coming up and that Health Canada can step
up and start to pump them out a little
[SPEAKER_03]: more quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have claimed to set service standards
for these kinds of things recently,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so hopefully we see that come true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can say that from a perspective of
the growing culture in British Columbia,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's an economic driver.
[SPEAKER_03]: It produces a lot of money for our
economy, more than forestry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also something that the province
and the regional districts haven't really
[SPEAKER_03]: embraced as that economic driver so that
they can encourage people to get into the
[SPEAKER_03]: space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so whether it's trying to stand in the
way or whether it's simply they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: understand, what we're finding is that
there's a certain amount, a certain lack
[SPEAKER_03]: of knowledge that's standing in our way to
allow this to grow quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need it in this province.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is David Herford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pleasure to be here and look forward to
your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very sensitive to the fact that Travis and
Joel are the growers on the panel,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's a pleasure to be here with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: My history is really 20, 25 years in
government at all different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started smoking cannabis when I was in
grade nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working in various crown corporations
and so on, designing government programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the ones I got to help design
was in 99, 2000, working for Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crutchin's administration and helped
design the medical marijuana program that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have today, also the designated grower
program and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the real reason that that program has
stood the test of time a number of core
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges is because we took a very
proactive approach and actually consulted
[SPEAKER_00]: the experts before we developed those
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very grateful to growers across the
country at that time, mostly through
[SPEAKER_00]: compassion clubs that helped design that
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: That certainly has been missing in this
current age where the program has really
[SPEAKER_00]: been designed almost to some degree in
spite of small producers as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that there's a lot that can
still be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires a lot more communication and
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been a political activist
through my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently I was national policy chair
for the Liberal Party of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not involved in that role anymore and was
proud that the leadership that our leader
[SPEAKER_00]: took in terms of making the commitment
that he made in the last election.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also here to say I think the
policy is failing on a number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles and various other things,
communication breakdown, but certainly not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting small growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the system I think is number one on
the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of problems, the government's not
achieving the policy goals that they
[SPEAKER_00]: established.
[SPEAKER_00]: The black market is still alive and well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not prevented the establishment
of large corporate conglomerates which was
[SPEAKER_00]: something that they wanted to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have not developed a
micro-licensing system that can support a
[SPEAKER_00]: small business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far only six I think have determined
have made it through the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only 200 or 300 or so have even tried
to make the attempt when we have 25,000
[SPEAKER_00]: growers across the country that are
approved in the medical system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look forward to your questions and
discussions about solutions to what some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those challenges could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go to the floor for the next
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to have the panelists
comment on we recognize some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges and the barriers that have been
created for craft growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure many of you in the room are
familiar with the micro-cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations and the processes and the type
of resources that it takes to get into the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulated regime.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to talk with each panelist
about giving me your number one priority
[SPEAKER_02]: where we in this room collectively,
with the opportunity we have before us for
[SPEAKER_02]: change, not only are we in the midst of a
federal election where votes count and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're strong in numbers, cannabis industry
definitely not only people who are engaged
[SPEAKER_02]: in industry but people who are either
recreational medicinal users.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also here in the province of BC we
have UBCM coming up at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: month where all of the municipal staff,
elected officials and provincial leaders
[SPEAKER_02]: gather to talk policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We at Niche as a non-profit for three
years in a row in partnership with Acres
[SPEAKER_02]: and others have tried to present a
workshop and have been rejected because I
[SPEAKER_02]: really believe that the myth and
stereotypes are still very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Article in the Globe and Mail last week
about how the federal leaders don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: want to talk about the cannabis file
including the Prime Minister who put
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization in the forefront in the last
campaign.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for each panelist if you could quickly
give me one thing that you think could
[SPEAKER_02]: pivotally move this dial if we all
collectively organized and reached out and
[SPEAKER_02]: wrote letters and knocked on doors to get
our message out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joel?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really hard to pick just one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well we've got, we have 30 minutes buddy
that wasn't my choice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay so I would say from an administrative
standpoint the build first policy is
[SPEAKER_06]: probably the biggest one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say that policy alone without any
other policy on the board is enough to
[SPEAKER_06]: kill the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: The requirement to build a hundred percent
of your infrastructure to help Canada's
[SPEAKER_06]: requirements which is a moving target is
really precludes a lot of participation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't walk into a room with potential
investors with nothing more than an idea
[SPEAKER_06]: and expect to get any kind of positive
results and I find it really hard to
[SPEAKER_06]: believe that the smart people at Health
Canada aren't aware of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for me that would be the number one and
you know the life-threatening disease then
[SPEAKER_06]: we can deal with the quality of
life-threatening diseases afterwards.
Travis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I mean I think a focus on trying to
educate everyone from policymakers to the
[SPEAKER_03]: public so when we when we look at like if
the government doesn't listen then get the
[SPEAKER_03]: public to act right so like I teach a
course at Camosun College on Vancouver
[SPEAKER_03]: Island about just basic the fundamentals
of running a cannabis business and how
[SPEAKER_03]: it's different than running another
business and the thing is everything's
[SPEAKER_03]: amplified they've amplified the risk
they've amplified the cost but the rest of
[SPEAKER_03]: it is still very much just running a
business and so if we can show the both
[SPEAKER_03]: the economic positive side of it and the
fact that the sky isn't falling and we can
[SPEAKER_03]: do this to policymakers and we can do this
to staff and we can do like I think that's
[SPEAKER_03]: an opportunity we have now in the early
stages of legalization that we have to
[SPEAKER_03]: focus on destigmatizing what we're doing
and we do that through somewhat
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional means by using education and
lobby and all of these things that already
[SPEAKER_03]: exist for other industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it's a little harder because the
stigma is there but it always has been you
[SPEAKER_03]: know it used to be that we just openly
broke the law and so now that's changing a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit and what we need to do is we
need to show people that this isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: something to be afraid of that this isn't
we accept much higher risk activities in
[SPEAKER_03]: society without batting an eye than
anything that could possibly be associated
[SPEAKER_03]: with cannabis and cannabis provides a
tremendous economic benefit and quite
[SPEAKER_03]: likely health and wellness benefits as
well and so I think it's gonna take time
[SPEAKER_03]: but it is about pounding that educational
gavel over and over and like trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk to policymakers most of them
politicians are still human most of them
[SPEAKER_03]: will listen to you right like most of them
if you approach them nicely they'll still
[SPEAKER_03]: listen and it's not easy and it's not
gonna move quickly and there's not gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: be a lot of quick changes but we just we
have to do it it's the only way to go
[SPEAKER_03]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I'd agree with what Travis said
around education I would I guess if I was
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking of one thing to craft growers is
do everything you can to maintain your
[SPEAKER_00]: independence really do everything you can
to maintain your independence organize
[SPEAKER_00]: into collectives that have your interests
at heart you know we've been working on
[SPEAKER_00]: establishing a BC cannabis co-op over the
last number of months and we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: close to finishing that off and getting
that going but I think it has been
[SPEAKER_00]: empowering to have people together who are
in common cause it is a David versus
[SPEAKER_00]: Goliath struggle I think that the sector
is in right now and you really need to
[SPEAKER_00]: organize into collectives to maximize your
political clout your purchasing power and
[SPEAKER_00]: your marketing clout as well in terms of
making sure when that day comes that
[SPEAKER_00]: magical day in the future when we have
thousands of craft growers being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: just continue doing what they're doing
today that you get a premium price for
[SPEAKER_00]: your product and I think that that's gonna
be the most important thing for craft
[SPEAKER_00]: growers maintain your independence
organize into collectives and then fight
[SPEAKER_00]: and advocate for your interests you cannot
underestimate the institutional biases
[SPEAKER_00]: that are against you the public health
system the police the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Justice and of course now we have large
corporate conglomerates that are
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in making sure that craft
growers don't get independent craft
[SPEAKER_00]: growers don't get a piece of that market
so I think that would be my number one
[SPEAKER_02]: thing to focus on I'd like to open up the
floor to questions as I said we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: wealth of knowledge and expertise here at
the table both from a craft growing
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective a regulatory perspective so I
can take over the mic for a long time but
[SPEAKER_04]: that's alright I'll bring the microphone
over to him right now let's hear it again
[SPEAKER_04]: for the panel right quick in an
abbreviated form I like that you guys are
[SPEAKER_07]: brief and succinct thank you Robert
Gorchek from LRG consulting thank you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: for being here today awesome information
so far I'm recently just established
[SPEAKER_07]: myself as Aboriginal descent recently
received that so I'm wondering what do you
[SPEAKER_07]: guys know about the economic aspects of
access to market for aboriginal kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: companies and that aspect of it especially
kind of more interested as well from
[SPEAKER_07]: David's opinion being there from the
Liberal Party well I can't speak for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Liberal Party you know what I try but on
the indigenous side I think again I see a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of similarities frankly as we've been
traveling around the province between
[SPEAKER_00]: craft growers and indigenous communities
they feel left out for a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: different reasons but I think they also
have tremendous clout we've seen some
[SPEAKER_00]: examples of that in British Columbia
around the retail piece of Vancouver
[SPEAKER_00]: Island and the Cowichan area so and I
think that also craft growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous communities see the plant in a
different way I think there's certainly a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of wellness pieces there's a lot of
you know spirituality in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: place that it's grown and so on and I
think also First Nations indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: communities also have an advantage around
land use I think there's plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: partnership opportunities I'd love to see
craft growers working more with indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: communities in BC the job creation
opportunities are significant I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: the mindset is very similar it's a rural
economic development initiative like
[SPEAKER_00]: really nothing we've seen in our
generation you know we talked about even
[SPEAKER_00]: just getting 900 growers in BC at 2,100
square feet two and a half full-time
[SPEAKER_00]: employees per grow-up that's 3,300 jobs
direct jobs in rural communities across BC
[SPEAKER_00]: in a year or two if we can get 900 growers
and that's a small number and we should
[SPEAKER_00]: really be making sure that indigenous
growers are in that mix and as we engage
[SPEAKER_00]: municipal governments we should be
thinking of indigenous communities as
[SPEAKER_00]: governments themselves and there's
tremendous opportunities I think there as
[SPEAKER_00]: well and we also see some movement at the
national level around taxation and so on
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth so I think it's something to
watch and I'm hopeful did you want to add
[SPEAKER_02]: anything Travis or Joel?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can add a little something actually but
a number of colleagues of mine that are
[SPEAKER_06]: dealing with a number of nations around
the country their feedback has been of
[SPEAKER_06]: course the government set up this separate
wing to deal exclusively with indigenous
[SPEAKER_06]: applications and what I've heard is that
it's not going quite as smoothly as
[SPEAKER_06]: anticipated and that perhaps there's been
a little bit of misleading on part of the
[SPEAKER_06]: government of how much they were going to
help indigenous communities and there's
[SPEAKER_06]: been a lot of misunderstanding between
band councils and especially elders where
[SPEAKER_06]: band councils are really focusing on the
development of expensive massive
[SPEAKER_06]: infrastructure for production and I've
talked to band councils members and elders
[SPEAKER_06]: from Manitoba from here and elsewhere and
the message that I keep giving them is
[SPEAKER_06]: retail is your best foot in the door in
the marketplace because it doesn't require
[SPEAKER_06]: the capital input immediately you have
shops you know already you just need to
[SPEAKER_06]: pass band councils to zone to allow
cannabis sales for medical purposes and so
[SPEAKER_06]: it can generate revenue very quickly for
the band it can generate a few jobs and
[SPEAKER_06]: you can develop relationships with craft
growers around the area because you can
[SPEAKER_06]: simply assert your independence from the
government and but again the message here
[SPEAKER_06]: is going to be unity because I've also
talked to bands talking about competing
[SPEAKER_06]: with other bands making sure the other
band doesn't get to market first all this
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff and I feel like unity is really
really the key here and really engaging
[SPEAKER_06]: the elders more on the spiritual side of
things to actually kind of bring the
[SPEAKER_06]: energy more into alignment so it kind of
can heal a little bit of the schisms that
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm seeing creating some of these
political dynamics within the band
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves any other questions from the
audience I have a question say someone has
[SPEAKER_04]: been an underground you know craft grower
for a while and they want they don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: a million dollars but they want to get
into it what can they do well I mean it's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of like starting a brewery a lot of
our craft brewing groups that turned into
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses started doing it in their
closets and doing it in their garages
[SPEAKER_03]: which is exactly where most of us started
growing it does you know like you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: take the mentality of essentially starting
over you have to take the mentality that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're gonna find potentially a new
location that you're gonna raise the money
[SPEAKER_03]: to make your build happen that you might
have to take on partners to do it right
[SPEAKER_03]: now you can bootstrap something small like
it doesn't have to be a million and a half
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars but you're not gonna get a full
canopy in a processor for you know very
[SPEAKER_03]: cheap and so if you want to start
bootstrapping it and health Canada's made
[SPEAKER_03]: clear they accept this you can start by
building one small grow room and one small
[SPEAKER_03]: dry room and taking a video of those two
rooms and applying for a license from
[SPEAKER_03]: those two and they if you get your license
then it's a lot more likely you're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to raise money or borrow money in
order to complete the project that's good
[SPEAKER_00]: advice I would also add you know consider
a medical license as well and it all
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to me you got to go talk to your
local municipality at some point you got
[SPEAKER_00]: to start that discussion a regional
district whatever the case may be
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous government you need to go and
start talking to them because they're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be key to your process no matter
what yeah and like a just to add to that a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit is like one of the biggest
things that has happened in consulting
[SPEAKER_03]: with people that want to do that convert
from a small home grow to do it for a
[SPEAKER_03]: living is that they need an architect they
need to get zoning they need to hire an
[SPEAKER_03]: electrical like mechanical engineer they
need to like all it's it's assembling it
[SPEAKER_03]: from the ground up is hard when everything
has to be to code and it's not what we've
[SPEAKER_03]: done in the past and so it's like we build
the code but we don't invite everybody in
[SPEAKER_03]: and in the past and so you got to do that
you get it's different but you got to do
[SPEAKER_03]: it so make sure that you get good
construction people and good trades people
[SPEAKER_08]: to work with that's very important so my
question is my question is well my
[SPEAKER_08]: question is how many actual micro grow
licenses have been given out in the
[SPEAKER_08]: province of British Columbia or Canada
period six across Canada and how long has
[SPEAKER_08]: this I recall like almost a year and a
half ago when Health Canada came out with
[SPEAKER_08]: the chart that specified micro grow LPs
and the hockey rink yeah the hockey rink
[SPEAKER_08]: is that is that exactly when they started
opening up to this idea or because I'm a
[SPEAKER_03]: little confused on that seems to me a year
and a half so October 17th we were able to
[SPEAKER_03]: apply for micro licensing but of course
that was you had to have a certain amount
[SPEAKER_03]: of work done at that point so not many
people were able to apply on October 17th
[SPEAKER_03]: 2018 those that did I think like there a
couple of them eight month nine month
[SPEAKER_03]: turnaround times for licensing from
application to receiving it but that was
[SPEAKER_03]: under the old rules where you didn't have
to build before you submitted so now
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got to have your build done and
you've got to do your video evidence
[SPEAKER_03]: package before you can submit your license
and so if we're waiting nine months from
[SPEAKER_03]: there that means the build which used to
be part of your licensing weight now has
[SPEAKER_03]: to be done ahead of time and so that
changes the timelines I think part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: reason we haven't seen more licenses
issued is because there was no
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding on a regional level of how
this was going to be zoned and so if I go
[SPEAKER_03]: out as a businessman and I'm told I don't
have a guarantee that they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: zone my space and I don't have a guarantee
Health Canada is going to give me a
[SPEAKER_03]: license what am I going to spend a whole
bunch of money with all that uncertainty
[SPEAKER_03]: and so we've seen a significant delay and
some fear involved in people not wanting
[SPEAKER_03]: to make that capital outlay at the start
without knowing they're going to see
[SPEAKER_08]: returns for sure right so hypothetically
speaking if you had a personal production
[SPEAKER_08]: license you already got inspections done
for that license and you've been granted
[SPEAKER_08]: the permission to grow a certain amount of
plants you could technically take that and
[SPEAKER_08]: then use that as your platform to procure
a micro license is that correct to a point
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah so Health Canada has also sort of
changed their tone on this they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: they didn't used to answer this question
but now they've made it pretty clear that
[SPEAKER_03]: they want those old licenses to convert
over so if you build a compliant facility
[SPEAKER_03]: around your MMAR space you can even send
your video evidence package in with plants
[SPEAKER_03]: growing and transfer those plants to your
legal license the problem is that a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: the compliance features that are required
from Health Canada inspectors and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: might not be how we did it in the old days
and so in order to retrofit around your
[SPEAKER_03]: plants you're going to have to probably
shut down for a little while and it really
[SPEAKER_03]: comes down to a question of cost if you're
not building from scratch and you've done
[SPEAKER_03]: a good job building your facility so it's
like waterproof walls like they want and
[SPEAKER_03]: all of the electricals in behind the
paneling like they want and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: perform a lot of these sanitation
protocols then you might be able to get in
[SPEAKER_03]: for you know not such a big sum of money
and Health Canada now accepts that it used
[SPEAKER_03]: to be a thing where they didn't but they
make it very clear that you can't keep
[SPEAKER_03]: your MMAR or ACM PR PPL license on the
property that you're also growing
[SPEAKER_03]: commercially without jumping through more
hoops than it would ever be worth so you
[SPEAKER_03]: probably want to either cancel or move
your PPL once you get a commercial license
[SPEAKER_03]: so if you go on to the Health Canada
website with all their guidance documents
[SPEAKER_03]: you can find some of the basics there's
the license application guide there's the
[SPEAKER_03]: GPP guide the GPP guides the most
important for cultivators you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have to infer some things they're not
going to tell you exactly what to do but
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to explain that you have to
have non porous walls well that means you
[SPEAKER_03]: got to put up RFP or PVC or some sort of
paint that's waterproof they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: explain some of those operational things
and then you essentially have to
[SPEAKER_03]: extrapolate from that and build they're
not going to tell you if it's right or
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong until they inspect you and they
don't inspect you a pre-license anymore
[SPEAKER_03]: they expect you after the license so you
know really what it is is in my experience
[SPEAKER_03]: is looking to other people that have been
approved and how they've done it and then
[SPEAKER_03]: taking those practices and putting it into
play and and so you know just have a
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation with those of us that have
been around and we can point you in some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the right directions but it's the
government man nothing's ever certain we
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know hey guys you mentioned reaching
out to regulators on all levels of
[SPEAKER_05]: government is there a more effective
message to be bringing forward to them
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done some reach outs myself I try to
stay away from the you know please let us
[SPEAKER_05]: get into your municipality or whatnot so
just curious a few words on that well I
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been elected to political office at
the municipal level for two terms I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been on the board of the Fraser Health
Authority I've been political aid and an
[SPEAKER_02]: activist by nature my entire life not only
raising your voice raising your voice as a
[SPEAKER_02]: part of a collective you know as the CEO
of grow tech labs we're now taking
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-legalization companies and supporting
them to get into the regulated market you
[SPEAKER_02]: know so when I hear people say they're
hesitant to reach out to their municipal
[SPEAKER_02]: provincial or federal elected people I
really believe that the only people we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a disservice to is to our cause and
to ourselves I think having a voice
[SPEAKER_02]: reaching out educating the panels
identified three areas you know education
[SPEAKER_02]: the economics of building out and looking
at the regulations as a problem the only
[SPEAKER_02]: way we're going to change that is a
collective voice but David can you touch a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit on some of the things that you
learned as you were traveling across the
[SPEAKER_02]: province with the co-op and some of the
things that we could do collectively you
[SPEAKER_00]: know thanks for the question I think it
really is a again organizing and
[SPEAKER_00]: collectives one of the things that I
talked earlier is about the benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: that is you really pool your political
clout and you organize yourself in a
[SPEAKER_00]: transparent fashion and you come up with
policies and proposals because certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: my experience at Health Canada when we
were bringing in the medical rules the
[SPEAKER_00]: bureaucrats don't have a clue on how
cannabis works how it's grown and so on so
[SPEAKER_00]: you really do have to gift wrap them the
solutions and you can you get those
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions from going out and talking at
talking to people so I think that advocacy
[SPEAKER_00]: piece is critical if you look at the
history of progress on cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: country it's not coming from officials
it's coming from politicians who are ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to take a risk or courts who are going to
force the politicians to do the right
[SPEAKER_00]: thing thanks to the good work of wonderful
lawyers like John Conroy and others who
[SPEAKER_00]: are here those are really the only two
ways we've ever got progress on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada political leadership or courts
officials well-meaning God love them we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't rely on them to make the changes so
you really need political action and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to come up with some realistic
solutions that can work certainly through
[SPEAKER_00]: our co-op process we've published a number
of recommendations that we think easy
[SPEAKER_00]: things the government can do the federal
government could do in an afternoon to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the system at least a little bit more
attractive to growers and investors and
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly we've got some positive feedback
from that and I think through our efforts
[SPEAKER_00]: we're starting to see some improvements in
the system people are being processed a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more we're raising this issue with
elected officials certainly we published a
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs report I think the job numbers are
something that speak very loudly
[SPEAKER_00]: especially to local officials who need a
tax base and when you can publish some
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers that we did that shows about 3,000
direct jobs in rural communities in the
[SPEAKER_01]: province that has a lot of impact as well
I think that as a Canadian citizen my
[SPEAKER_01]: measure of success in the production of
cannabis is having a safe product and I am
[SPEAKER_01]: struggling to understand why as crop
producers we have producing number one a
[SPEAKER_01]: crop quality product but number two why is
the government insisting that we take on
[SPEAKER_01]: all this expensive infrastructure and
additional cost when we all agree that
[SPEAKER_01]: safety testing should be the measure
really of whether there's a product that
[SPEAKER_01]: is safe why then do they make us build all
this stuff and go to all this additional
[SPEAKER_01]: expense what is the justification for that
I honestly I'm struggling to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: that because I do not see a purpose for it
if we have a good product and it passes
[SPEAKER_01]: all the tests what is the issue why do I
have to take out a million dollar loan why
[SPEAKER_06]: is any of that necessary yeah let's that's
really one of the big issues and to me
[SPEAKER_06]: what it speaks to is the politicization of
the process we clearly have a double
[SPEAKER_06]: standard of enforcement we have
regulations that have double standards
[SPEAKER_06]: built into them to begin with and to me
that speaks directly to the politicization
[SPEAKER_06]: of the process without going deeper
because we really could if we wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah I mean my one word answer would be
stigma I don't think that the government
[SPEAKER_03]: understands what we do this would be an
agricultural pursuit this would be
[SPEAKER_03]: something regulated under AGRI instead
they're regulating it closer to pharma and
[SPEAKER_03]: so part of it is that they focus so much
on the processes which is quality
[SPEAKER_03]: assurance and that they've put these
certain standards in there that would be
[SPEAKER_03]: considered pharmaceutical grade standards
or you know we probably treat plutonium
[SPEAKER_03]: with less care than we treat our cannabis
right now no it's not right and as a
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivator like do I think that that's a
good idea no I don't I mean I also think
[SPEAKER_03]: their testing regime has this total yeast
and mold bacterial counts that are useless
[SPEAKER_03]: tests and have been shown over and over
and and so like what do we do we submit
[SPEAKER_03]: papers to the government saying this is
wrong here's how they're doing in Alaska
[SPEAKER_03]: here's what qPCR is here are these things
but right now we're in a mode where this
[SPEAKER_03]: is brand new and it's gonna take us time
and so my choice as a grower is either a
[SPEAKER_03]: state black market or build a conforming
facility and step into the white market
[SPEAKER_03]: and like I've chosen the latter but I
would never tell anybody to make that
[SPEAKER_03]: decision that's my personal decision if
people want to keep operating in the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market I encourage them to do so yeah and
I would add to the in addition to Travis's
[SPEAKER_00]: two points I would add a third which is
advocate and change the rules and
[SPEAKER_00]: congratulations to you Ellie and your
group in the Kootenays for your advocacy
[SPEAKER_00]: as well I think that again we can't you
know if you were designing a program to
[SPEAKER_00]: fail this is what you would design and I
think that to the point earlier about the
[SPEAKER_00]: question about six like let's just stop
for a second and think of the number six
[SPEAKER_00]: and just how pathetic that is six right
there's 25,000 across the country growing
[SPEAKER_00]: under the medical program and I know when
we were bringing the medical program in we
[SPEAKER_00]: had pressure around infrastructure and we
got to go inspect and we got to go test
[SPEAKER_00]: and we got to tell the cops where they're
at we got to tell the municipalities where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're at and we said no way because no
one's going to participate in the program
[SPEAKER_00]: and we were able to do that and we've now
had and was that 2018 years of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: growers producing cannabis for people no
one's died people keep renewing their
[SPEAKER_00]: prescriptions doctors continue to examine
people and say Ellie it's working for you
[SPEAKER_00]: keep on going so we do we can't accept the
premise of the current regulations the way
[SPEAKER_00]: they're presented it is a false choice it
is the way it is and I agree that people
[SPEAKER_00]: have limited choices right now but we have
to fight to change it you can change it if
[SPEAKER_00]: we collectively pool our political clout
and demand the changes because craft
[SPEAKER_00]: producers have the product everybody wants
it's why people are not going into the
[SPEAKER_00]: stores now our products not there right
the governments are feeling it they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: making the money so just keep on pushing
organize yourself maintain your
[SPEAKER_00]: independence and just keep on fighting the
way you've always been fighting all these
[SPEAKER_04]: years thank you thank you we're out of
time
