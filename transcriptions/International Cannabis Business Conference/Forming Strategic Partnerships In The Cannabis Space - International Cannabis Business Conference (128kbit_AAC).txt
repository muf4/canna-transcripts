[SPEAKER_03]: So good afternoon OCBC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's lame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good afternoon, OCBC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Show Alex how awesome this is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give him a little bit of love.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to briefly introduce the folks on
this panel and then allow each of them a
[SPEAKER_03]: moment to tell you why you should care
about what they have to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some amazing expertise up here to
not just talk about what you need to do,
[SPEAKER_03]: but importantly, what not to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in order to my right and your left,
we have Vincent Diacolti, the co-founder
[SPEAKER_03]: and COO of Show Companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to go ahead and give a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vincent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey guys, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the co-founder of Show Companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been on the quest to build a family
of brands, both ancillary and THC touching
[SPEAKER_05]: brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started in the industry about five
years ago with a brand Rosentech Products,
[SPEAKER_05]: familiarized to become one of the leaders
in solventless extraction equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Continued on to garnish a catalog of over
4,000 ancillary products, CBD wellness.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also operate a distribution company in
the state of California that manufactures
[SPEAKER_05]: and distributes in the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Vincent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next to Vincent, we have Mark Slaw,
and he is the founder and CEO of iComply.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark, tell us about iComply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Dale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Mark Slaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm CEO and founder of iComply.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the oldest cannabis compliance
company in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was founded back in 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been involved in Colorado and some of
the early legislative stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're based out of Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've helped over 200 clients in
probably 13, 14 different national and
[SPEAKER_01]: international markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're active in about 10 different states.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do is compliance management,
very similar to what you'll see in any
[SPEAKER_01]: other heavily regulated industry,
whether that's hospitals, oil and gas,
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a world to this cannabis thing,
sometimes a four-letter word known as
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance, which is important to be
proactive rather than reactive about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm here to really share with you guys
what that experience looks like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what it looks like to unpack that buzzword
of compliance and really set up and manage
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriately an operational compliance
infrastructure as a strategic partnership
[SPEAKER_01]: for your businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And next to you, we have Mr. Rocco
Petrilli, the chairman of the National
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Risk Management Association.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: The NCRMA, we're relatively new to the
game.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been around about 18 months and
really active for about 14 of those 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're a voice of our members.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our members are the owners and
operators all along the vertical who are
[SPEAKER_02]: just finding out in many cases that good
and effective risk management is very key
[SPEAKER_02]: to success in any business arena.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our message is very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our mission is to make our members better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're committed to and in the process
of creating a pioneering and disruptive
[SPEAKER_02]: and very innovative risk management
platform that's gonna fit this
[SPEAKER_02]: non-traditional industry like a glove.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we look forward to bringing that to our
members and growing with this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Rocco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next to you, Justin Bautier.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a partner at Calix CPAs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I'm a partner at a CPA firm based
in the hills of southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been doing business tax accounting,
tax planning since 2006, self-employed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do a lot in the business advisory
entity formations, 280E mitigation in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you are familiar with 280E and the
complexity that brings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as well as we act kind of as a
general contractor in terms of your
[SPEAKER_00]: accounting needs, payroll, bookkeeping,
higher level accounting, taxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: tax planning, so those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find solutions for you in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm gonna be talking about the tax
consequences of strategic partnerships in
[SPEAKER_00]: this case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually negative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin McCarthy on the end and our hammer,
the membership director for CCIA of which
[SPEAKER_03]: many of you are members.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us a little more about yourself,
Justin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, yeah, my name is Justin McCarthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was membership director for,
except a couple of weeks ago I'm now,
[SPEAKER_04]: I do operations and business development.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations on, can we get a woohoo?
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing membership team now, so I'm not
having to do it by myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in short, I've been with the
association for five years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: The association turns seven next month.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do a lot of the legislative and
regulatory work in Sacramento,
[SPEAKER_04]: so working very closely with state
departments and legislative officials in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of getting the situation we're in
figured out.
[SPEAKER_04]: My side with the business development,
obviously work on a lot of our strategic
[SPEAKER_04]: partnerships offering enhanced member
discounts that our members can take
[SPEAKER_04]: advantage of and giving them the education
that they need to survive in the industry
[SPEAKER_04]: that is California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we realize that the success
or relative failures of each of our
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunities, our business, often rests
on who we choose as a strategic partner
[SPEAKER_03]: and how we go about forming that
partnership I've looked around,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of folks are suing each other and it
seems to boil down to two things,
[SPEAKER_03]: who you chose as a partner and what that
contract looked like.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what is a partner?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very broad word, broad term,
strategic partnership.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first I just want to explore with you
guys real quick because each of you come
[SPEAKER_03]: from a different aspect of the industry,
what types of strategic partnerships you
[SPEAKER_03]: come across and what you're looking for in
those partnerships.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you vet them?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start here with Vincent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So since we have an expansive catalog of
about 4,000 products, some of them are in
[SPEAKER_05]: house and others are obviously with
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I deal with partners every single day.
[SPEAKER_05]: My business is based on dealing with
strategic partnerships.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't operate my business without
partnerships after all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for me the biggest thing in a strategic
partnership is sort of being upfront and
[SPEAKER_05]: honest in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're looking to be doing business for
longevity.
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, anything you're hiding or leaving
off the table will be exposed in the long
[SPEAKER_05]: run.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think if you're able to just,
whatever makes you think you're hiding
[SPEAKER_05]: something or you're uncomfortable of,
lay it out because usually it's not as big
[SPEAKER_05]: of a deal as you think and if you lay it
out in the beginning and you can iron
[SPEAKER_05]: those details out in honesty before you
move forward, it's easier at that point
[SPEAKER_05]: rather than setting expectations in a way
that you're leading someone on kind of.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're just asking for disaster
at that point and that's why someone's
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna sue you and that's why they're not
gonna have a conversation with you to fix
[SPEAKER_05]: things because you led them on in a
demeanor that wasn't honest at the end of
[SPEAKER_05]: the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think for me the biggest thing in
strategic partnerships is being upfront
[SPEAKER_05]: and laying it out on the line in the
beginning rather than trying to act like
[SPEAKER_05]: you're something that you're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so be clear about what you're gonna
do but also be clear about what you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna do right up front.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean without integrity nothing works,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So says the compliance guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you guys get more time in this
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say you don't get more time,
you get more team.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me that's what strategic partnerships
are all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are things that he's going to be
good at and loves to do that I'm not good
[SPEAKER_01]: at and don't love to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with more people around me to
basically supplement and align vision,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more can be done in a way that
actually works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm a firm believer that if you
share the same vision, everything else is
[SPEAKER_01]: a conversation for workability.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we achieve that vision?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we set those goals?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we make that happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have somebody new that comes to us
for example and says, hey, I want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: taking my compliance to the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I have gaps in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I could do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of what we need to hear and
see and understand in any sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: strategic partnership where I'm gonna put
my time forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not really here to waste anybody's
money or my time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get a lot more of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with strategic partnerships you
actually expand both of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to think about it from that
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we put integrity in place?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we set expectations in a real
honest upfront manner?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also how do we surround ourselves with
people that share our same vision and are
[SPEAKER_01]: willing to put in the work to respect each
other and to create something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger than each of you individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what strategic
partnerships are all about for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin, you look like you're about to jump
out of your chair.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to go next?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll shake it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back to Rocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to say something before?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocco's always good for a comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I knew I could end with him.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm navigating.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quickly went from the young guy in the
room to the old man in the cave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm still trying to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with that 30 plus years in business
comes a lot of wisdom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm about two years into cannabis and
risk management after about 34 years in
[SPEAKER_02]: automotive components manufacturing where
I did and formed and worked with
[SPEAKER_02]: partnerships all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a pretty good perspective of
what worked and what didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really comes down to a good partner
is going to believe your vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to share your mission.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to live your core
values.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else is secondary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, I have been involved in
situations where there were technical
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons, there were geographic reasons,
there were logistic reasons to form these
[SPEAKER_02]: partnerships.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were all trumped by particularly
the core values side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody that's in the business,
starting the business, new in the
[SPEAKER_02]: business, or been in the business for some
time, if you don't have a vision,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you don't have a set mission statement,
and if you don't have a set of core values
[SPEAKER_02]: that trumps everything you do in your
business, I suggest you get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because those are really going to form the
criteria for the partnerships that you
[SPEAKER_02]: form going forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocco, that's so well said.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would dare say that that applies to
every relationship in our life,
[SPEAKER_03]: most of which are strategic, whether it be
personal or professional.
[SPEAKER_03]: So well stated.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without repeating that, Mark and Rocco
definitely highlighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to be successful in
business if you don't have partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have external
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this industry, it seems like it's
almost essential to have internal
[SPEAKER_00]: partnerships as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you are looking for investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you are investing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of you need knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you need investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a tricky combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely, choosing the right
individuals with the right skill sets is
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Successful businesses have many different
leadership styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to have those people that are
sharing the various skill sets and
[SPEAKER_00]: complementing one another and sharing the
same vision and subscribing to the values
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's obviously hard to elaborate off of
what they talked about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, it's clear value add for our
members.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this going to be a partnership that
benefits our membership base and why?
[SPEAKER_04]: So finding those areas are obviously
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once you find those areas,
find people that align.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our mission statement is our guiding
principles for everything we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we're partnering with people that
don't align with that, that's when things
[SPEAKER_04]: tend to get messy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really partnering with people that it's
not necessarily just a win-win for me and
[SPEAKER_04]: whoever they partner with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I look for partners who are doing good
in their community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having more of a broad sort of benefit as
a nonprofit trade association is
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely something we look for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is strategic relationships,
strategic partnerships are often a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit like love.
[SPEAKER_03]: You fall in love with what you think that
person can do for your business or what
[SPEAKER_03]: you think they can do for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think that business can do for
your business?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all know fools rush in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think, oh, this is a great idea and we
can build this business together.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the failure to clearly articulate
whose role is what and finding people that
[SPEAKER_03]: not only complement but in some cases fill
those gaps that you actually are not good
[SPEAKER_03]: at the same things and don't think alike
because that can strengthen your business
[SPEAKER_03]: if the core values are the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as much as we can all talk about that
perfect relationship that we always seek,
[SPEAKER_03]: how do you triangulate that that
relationship is who they say they are?
[SPEAKER_01]: What you said just resonated with me
because there was many years in our
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were three offices coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 20 employees and a lot of our
strategy was, well, let's just get people
[SPEAKER_01]: to realize how not compliant they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would call and say, do you have
these SOPs and do you have this or do you
[SPEAKER_01]: have that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I didn't realize was we weren't
really putting our core values out there
[SPEAKER_01]: to be shared in a way that aligned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we got were a lot of people that
reacted to noncompliance, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than finding that three or 5% of
the industry, the select few out there
[SPEAKER_01]: that wanted to be proactive about
compliance management and be in a position
[SPEAKER_01]: where they could be proud about their
compliance and say that we can stand by
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was a very expensive lesson to
learn, that if you don't vet it out or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not a stand for the values that you
say you are in the world, you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: going to track the wrong thing instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's something to the integrity of
yourself, too, in finding out who to
[SPEAKER_01]: partner with or who to vet and how you
work with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would add to that, trust your gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't always necessarily know why,
but your subconscious does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocco?
[SPEAKER_02]: And much of this responsibility really
falls on the shoulders of leadership.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a leader, it's important to really
strive for clarity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And alignment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to force situations where those things
can be measured.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I've been around a long time,
and I have what I fondly call Rocco's 10
[SPEAKER_02]: Rules of Business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them is what gets measured gets
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to find a way to quantify.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before you can quantify, again,
to get back in front of that, it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: the clarity issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can't just, as the other panel
members were saying, you can't just say,
[SPEAKER_02]: these are my core values.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to quantify those core values.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to be very clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best way to show people you're
clear is through demonstration,
[SPEAKER_02]: not through instruction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's key.
[SPEAKER_02]: And set that bar high.
[SPEAKER_02]: You only get one shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You only get one shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you get a chance to set that bar,
set it high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know the answer as far as
how to vet people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because oftentimes it can be trial and
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having a very good operating agreement
up front, especially in a joint venture,
[SPEAKER_00]: is absolutely imperative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely want to hire a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything off of the legal Zoom or
copying and pasting a Word template off
[SPEAKER_00]: the internet when you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they have the expertise to go
through all the what-ifs with you and then
[SPEAKER_00]: get those written down in detail of how
are we going to handle this if this
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember to hire slowly, fire fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, fail quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you bring up an important point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in a marriage, you take vows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's hope you're not vowing something
that you're not going to stick to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're entering into a business,
you also have to make vows that these are
[SPEAKER_03]: the things that I am going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this partnership, this is my statement
of work, what I'm responsible for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also strongly recommend that you state
what you intend to fail at, meaning this
[SPEAKER_03]: is what I'm not going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's where the gaps often fall
is, oh, I thought you were going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You thought I was going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, screw you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to court.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that brings me to the prenup,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The exit strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found when entering into strategic
partnerships that envisioning the exit is
[SPEAKER_03]: the best way to get to the agreement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where and how is this going to either sell
or dissolve or achieve its goal,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever it is, and then work backwards
from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd love for some of you to speak to
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you envision the exit strategy with
respect to your strategic partnerships?
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, honestly, in a lot of our
partnerships, I think I scare away some
[SPEAKER_05]: partnerships in the early on stage because
I go straight to that end stage with
[SPEAKER_05]: people right away or at least discuss it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I say, well, what are we talking about for
five years down the line, 10 years down
[SPEAKER_05]: the line?
[SPEAKER_05]: How long are you online?
[SPEAKER_05]: How long are you committing to me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you two years?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you in this for five years?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you selling in two years?
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to ask those questions up front
to really see what the partnership's going
[SPEAKER_05]: to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have one idea of where this
partnership's going, and their idea is a
[SPEAKER_05]: completely different thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you might start off and everything's
great, but then where you're going is
[SPEAKER_05]: different, and that's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's OK to scare someone away
because that just means it's not going to
[SPEAKER_05]: work out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just be straight again up front and
honest of where you're going with things
[SPEAKER_05]: to vet people out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to take a different slant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it's not always successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not claiming that it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like to, what I call, create the
Hotel California situation with
[SPEAKER_02]: partnerships.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can check out any time you like,
but you can never leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to make them perpetual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you should always be looking for a
reason that you want your partner to stay,
[SPEAKER_02]: and your partner should always be giving
you a reason that they want to stay,
[SPEAKER_02]: and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always about creating value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you get into a partnership,
it's no longer all about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to spend a lot of time and
effort in evaluating the value proposition
[SPEAKER_02]: of your partner as well as you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't spend a lot of time on
predetermined expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Predestined strategies or termination
clauses or periods of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to spend the time and effort on the
evolution of a partnership that'll outlast
[SPEAKER_02]: the business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's a combination of the
two there that some people can find
[SPEAKER_03]: success in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to say something on the end,
Justin?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just make sure that the relationship that
you have with your strategic partner,
[SPEAKER_04]: the alignment of the mission statement,
that is with the business and not the
[SPEAKER_04]: person.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as we've all seen in this
industry, people move around often.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worked on partnerships with somebody
for three months.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then give them a call back,
and they're no longer there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely making sure that everything
is clearly written down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a lawyer, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, definitely make sure that the
partnership is with the actual business
[SPEAKER_04]: and not just a contact that you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolute great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because so many people form
partnerships because it's in part a
[SPEAKER_02]: personal relationship with the player.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when that player doesn't show up
to play first base that day, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they're stuck because they realize it
wasn't with the business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially in this industry right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, people are moving so fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to try to keep our database clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a full-time job almost,
just with how much different movement is
[SPEAKER_04]: happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I ever clean out my shoe boxes of your
business cards, I have your entire work
[SPEAKER_03]: histories, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say the other point is get
to know veterans who know people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because usually somebody knows somebody in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's either going to be a
reputation that's positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can count on that person being
there in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or there's one that's maybe not so
positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important to ask the
peers that are in respected leadership
[SPEAKER_01]: positions whether you should be forming
strategic partners with certain people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's taken us sweat, blood,
and tears to build what we have as brands
[SPEAKER_01]: and reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which are things people can't take away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're also double-edged swords that
can easily cut you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hand somebody that in trust,
and they turn it against you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's used in a way that really is
detrimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than sort of adding value at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, because we're doing it at
the NCRMA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our risk management platform is so broad
that the vast majority of the risk
[SPEAKER_02]: management services that we're offering
are through service partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing to keep clearly in mind,
you spend a lot of time and money and
[SPEAKER_02]: effort creating and protecting your brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you bring a service partner on
board that person has to, or that company
[SPEAKER_02]: has to have the same obligation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they become part of your brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no separation at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're my service partner and you do
something wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: That reflects badly on the brand of the
NCRMA or whatever business we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a certain level of commitment
as a partner to be able to say I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be here for you in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tell people, for example,
my company, we take that stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Integrity, excellence, leadership are our
core values.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not here to make a one-time
checkbox happen and say you're compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compliance is, for example, an ongoing
continual process of continued
[SPEAKER_01]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that just magically
happens overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's at least a year-long agreement
with our clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, two to five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you're the front, you own that
partnership.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's no sidestepping the fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you act for my benefit with my
members and you don't perform,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just like me not performing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's important, too,
as you look to these strategic
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships that you find alignment in
that the goal helps the people involved do
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: The agreement itself, the partnership,
the relationship has to raise all ships.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or one of the partners is always getting
screwed or doing more work or wanting to
[SPEAKER_03]: find a way out or find a way around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of the more successful
relationships I've seen aren't people that
[SPEAKER_03]: even necessarily like each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they have aligned common goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have a similar work ethic that
when one wins, the other one wins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that those are some of the
most successful long-term relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious, because we all can talk about
what to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to hear what not to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you started tiptoeing down into this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only is this the more interesting and
juicy topic of conversation, but at
[SPEAKER_03]: Oakster Dam, we're big fans of not just
setting you up for success, but preparing
[SPEAKER_03]: you for the worst.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of potholes on the road to
legalization and regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you are likely to step in one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you become a better bullshit
detector?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what made you a better one?
[SPEAKER_03]: What terrible things are you hoping they
don't accidentally do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this comes into management styles
for me, at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very tight, loose tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will set the expectations up front,
let people know exactly what I need,
[SPEAKER_01]: how I need it, and what I'll do for them
in return.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's a game of integrity,
showing up with your word and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it, because you said you would.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also give that freedom and space for
another conversation to happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: for things to happen, for business to
happen, with the commitment of just trust,
[SPEAKER_01]: respect, and place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have to allow for people to
show up and for people to lift you up
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of tear you down or whatever else
they could end up doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in that loose space that I often
find that I'm discerning most whether or
[SPEAKER_01]: not this is going to be a valuable
strategic partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, you can then come back
to that tight on the other end of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: tight, loose, tight, and hold them
accountable.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my world, accountability is love.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I want to make sure my clients
are going to be successful, because they
[SPEAKER_01]: have accountability, transparency,
and integrity in their business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, that's kind of how we like to
operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to be able to at least create sort of
a structure that we can figure that out,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do that dance and figure out
whether or not that strategic partner is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a waste of each other's time
and money and not be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's much easier to break up at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you really can, show up on the other
end of that and take responsibility and do
[SPEAKER_01]: what you gotta do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sometimes it's good to just say,
you know, maybe this isn't the right time,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I want to be your friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's wait until certain things happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin, you see a lot of strategic
partnerships within the CCIA, and I'd love
[SPEAKER_03]: to hear a little bit, and then go to
Justin Botier right after.
[SPEAKER_03]: My Justin's on the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, we touched on this a little
bit, but seeing partnerships be formed
[SPEAKER_04]: without the right documentation is really,
really bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, when I was new at this,
I formed a partnership for an event with a
[SPEAKER_04]: person that things weren't, the
deliverables on both sides weren't clear,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the MOU slipped, things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, then you're left to
put the whole bill, put the whole event,
[SPEAKER_04]: put the whole program, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously, I learned the hard way that
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just really making sure,
yeah, that you know their side of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can be very clear with what
you want out of the partnership,
[SPEAKER_04]: but really making sure that you're clear
on what they want out of it to be able to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, not just work for six months,
but work for three to five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when it's very clear on both
sides, people are, I mean, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't necessarily have to like each
other, but you're invested at,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a little bit deeper level than
just a business perspective when you truly
[SPEAKER_04]: care about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that slips a lot, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my experience as far as this goes often
comes from the investor-operator
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the person with the money,
and there's the person with the knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: and oftentimes the people with the
knowledge leave with the money,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the people with the money leave with
the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've heard that one
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important that as an
investor, you stay active in the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a hold of the bookkeeping,
maybe cloud-based book, and you're always
[SPEAKER_00]: staying diligent as far as how the
expenditures are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that the policies
and procedures are going correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's people with different skill
sets that should be being employed in any
[SPEAKER_00]: good successful business.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the people who are
systems-oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the visionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the person who deals with the
employees and facilitates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want all of those things going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an investor, you want to stay
involved in that to make sure that your
[SPEAKER_00]: money is being spent properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the big thing that I like to warn
people about, especially from an investor
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, is oftentimes this is totally
going off in a different direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're considering buying a
business, you've got to always take into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration the tax ramifications of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people think that maybe buying a
dispensary is a really great idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it looks profitable on a cash
flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just wait until that cash return gets
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, before you enter into any
relationship with anyone or any entity,
[SPEAKER_03]: there are several tax organizations that
you're going to want to double-check their
[SPEAKER_03]: history, because you could be getting into
bed with someone that did not understand
[SPEAKER_03]: 280E, and now you are marrying into their
tax liabilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocco?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, another point when considering a
partnership, because many times when we
[SPEAKER_02]: consider partners, I mean, we approach it
very much like we're hiring key employees
[SPEAKER_02]: or hiring employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a danger is, I mean, don't focus only
on the cognitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, like many of us,
guilty of it for years until I discovered
[SPEAKER_02]: the true value of talent optimization.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like many of us, you know,
when we hire somebody, we interview them,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we ask them the technical questions,
and we look at their resume, and we check
[SPEAKER_02]: their references, and all the cognitive
skills are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the relationship doesn't work out
because of, you know, the behavioral side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't take the time and effort or
implement the tools that we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: properly evaluate the behavioral side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like, you know, we're hired
for what we know, and we're fired for who
[SPEAKER_02]: we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's equally important from a partner
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to understand not only the
cognitive skill set of your partnership,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also the behavioral skill set,
because that's where it goes south.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how many times has a partnership
truly gone south because the person or the
[SPEAKER_02]: company that you partnered with didn't
know what you thought they knew?
[SPEAKER_02]: Very seldom, because that's what we vet.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we don't vet is how they behave,
what's important to them, how they're
[SPEAKER_02]: motivated, how they think, how dominant
they are, how they communicate,
[SPEAKER_02]: patience or impatience, formality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an area that I think we have to
spend much more time on in developing
[SPEAKER_02]: partnerships that do become perpetual.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to say, don't be fooled
by perception, and you should fact check,
[SPEAKER_05]: because sometimes you can lead into what
people are saying and want to believe it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that want to believe leads you to
believe it rather than actually doing your
[SPEAKER_05]: homework and taking out the books and
whatever factual evidence you need to make
[SPEAKER_05]: the right choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for that segue,
because I would add to everything that you
[SPEAKER_03]: said, educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, do the homework to not just know
your business, but their business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Know just enough to know what keeps them
up at night, what are their goals and
[SPEAKER_03]: responsibilities in that strategic
partnership.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to explain to folks, well,
I'm just going into the business of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to be ancillary or just,
just, just.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but you have to know what the growers
are dealing with, what the patients are
[SPEAKER_03]: dealing with in order to be truly the best
dispensary, including your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So educating yourself on the entire supply
chain, but also the rights and
[SPEAKER_03]: responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this person a fiduciary?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this person have other
responsibilities that you need to be aware
[SPEAKER_03]: of that might involve agencies where
they're forced into certain behavior,
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's what's required of them
that you might not understand or expect as
[SPEAKER_03]: a cannabis business owner.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious what keeps you guys up at
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What keeps you up at night over your
strategic partnerships?
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, like, like keeps me up at night
is what like worrying about, or keeps me
[SPEAKER_05]: up at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I'm not going for the excitement
part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, that was awkward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you worry about?
[SPEAKER_03]: The 3 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't worry much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sleep well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't have started with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wants to answer that?
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a stab at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got into this because I'm passionate
about what cannabis, cannabis can do for
[SPEAKER_01]: people and in ending, right, the war on
drugs and sort of the world of the
[SPEAKER_01]: advocacy side of things like you did,
Dale, back in the day, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a much bigger thing than me
even involved here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just do the most boring, non-sexy thing
of marijuana called compliance because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a stand for integrity and
transparency and professionalism in our
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what keeps me up at night is that we're
in this very unique and niche position in
[SPEAKER_01]: which we deal with the investor and the
white collar sort of world of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't just mean that figuratively.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're mostly like rich white men.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the other side of it
which is the cannabis industry where
[SPEAKER_01]: people came from for a lot of years going
through the war on drugs and the war
[SPEAKER_01]: against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what keeps me up at night is
trying to get those two worlds to really
[SPEAKER_01]: understand and speak the same language and
be able to communicate their sets of
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations to each other so that their
strategic partnerships can work because we
[SPEAKER_01]: actually need both for this thing to
become what it can become.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a compliance person,
I often think and worry about sort of what
[SPEAKER_01]: can we do with regard to social equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sit on National Cannabis Industry
Association's Equity, Diversity,
[SPEAKER_01]: Inclusion Committee being half Brazilian
myself doing a lot of work in Latin
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we raise other countries up that
have been most impacted by the war on
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs?
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of these are what I'm looking for
as strategic partners when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: aligning values and what you're really up
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also how can compliance become the
dictionary, the thesaurus, the translator
[SPEAKER_01]: between those two worlds and create that
level of accountability and integrity that
[SPEAKER_01]: both sides need to be able to have with
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that's the only language is
the one written for attorneys,
[SPEAKER_01]: by attorneys that we then need to
translate throughout the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: organization and get into place in a way
that is going to make those strategic
[SPEAKER_01]: partners work and that business grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that you are reminding us all to be
thoughtful about who we look for to
[SPEAKER_03]: partner.
[SPEAKER_03]: That it sometimes takes a moment longer to
look a little harder to find a veteran,
[SPEAKER_03]: a person of color, a woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm married to a white guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two young sons and a daughter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope one of them turns into a rich white
guy someday.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's about seeking out the not obvious
opportunities and often these are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be your best relationships for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocco?
[SPEAKER_02]: Strictly from a professional and from a
risk management perspective, what I find
[SPEAKER_02]: most challenging in tackling this elephant
in the room is different from other
[SPEAKER_02]: industries of which I've played that many
of us would have played that are much more
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really two types of risk in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were talking about this in the
green room.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the internal risk, which is the
risk that is truly inherent in owning and
[SPEAKER_02]: operating a cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then much, much, and if it was just
simply left at that, we'd have the problem
[SPEAKER_02]: solved.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the real problem comes in is
differentiating and defining the external
[SPEAKER_02]: risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all the risk that is inflicted
on the cannabis business owner because
[SPEAKER_02]: they've chosen cannabis as a way to make a
living.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to, from an association that
focuses on risk management, we spend a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of time differentiating those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And believe me, the latter is much more
difficult in terms of coming up with
[SPEAKER_02]: service partners and solutions to help our
members advance the ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what keeps me up at night is
definitely I want my clients to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the bureaucratic environment,
the compliance environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's almost like you have to
break rules in order to also follow rules
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in California, it's like 90% of
businesses are out of compliance right now
[SPEAKER_00]: one way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banking right now is very difficult to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very insecure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my home region of southern Oregon,
there is no THC banking available unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to go to Salem, which is quite
north.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the federal government requires
that you pay certain taxes electronically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe you get a personal bank
account, start commingling funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never recommend doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do you answer to all of these
things?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what keeps me up at night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, I think empathy, like actually
caring about the members.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when I'm forming strategic
partnerships, it's to directly offer
[SPEAKER_04]: services, benefits to our entire
membership base.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not just a partnership of mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's potentially a partnership of all 500
businesses that are involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really doing your homework and not
forming a strategic partnership that's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to screw over a dozen members.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's going to be a sticky
situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our credibility gets hit and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a little bit different from an
association standpoint because our
[SPEAKER_04]: partnerships are to facilitate
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when there's that snowball effect,
if it's good, that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's bad, it could get messy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and I'd like to circle back to
something that a couple of you touched on,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is that mission and understanding
not just your mission, but the mission of
[SPEAKER_03]: your strategic partnerships.
[SPEAKER_03]: That a mission is not just something that
you pay to etch on the wall behind you
[SPEAKER_03]: that people like clock in and clock out as
they walk by and ignore it and stop seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: it for years and years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mission statement is actually what
you bounce all your decisions off of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this make sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be a living, breathing
decision of this is how we do business.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may also have a vision statement that
helps you delineate a few more things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, that's not just
something that you write down and put
[SPEAKER_03]: aside.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is what you can use to determine
whether or not these strategic
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships or partnerships are
beneficial to your core mission and your
[SPEAKER_03]: core goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the school, our mission is to
provide quality training for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, I bounce it off
of three things every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's best for the students, what's best
for the staff and faculty, and what's best
[SPEAKER_03]: for the school in that order.
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be something that's amazing
for the students and it will destroy my
[SPEAKER_03]: faculty and staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's gonna kill the people that have to
execute it, it's not a good deal because
[SPEAKER_03]: these are the folks that you need to
embrace and drive it forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: If those two things are there,
but it's gonna break your bottom line,
[SPEAKER_03]: then maybe you need to bring in another
strategic relationship like an investor or
[SPEAKER_03]: a CPA or some tax advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you can figure out that core goal
and then bounce off, do you measure up to
[SPEAKER_03]: who we are, who we say we are,
and what we say we're trying to do,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say nine tenths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Decide right then and there if this is
right or not and now you know who to focus
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that last thing, I'm gonna say it
again, decide what you're not gonna be any
[SPEAKER_03]: good at.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the most valuable lessons I
am still trying to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many shiny objects, so many amazing
people, and some of these shiny objects
[SPEAKER_03]: are gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are raw diamonds, and some is bull's
gold, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not saying shiny objects are bad,
but if you have a way to pan for the gold,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is your mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are your core values.
[SPEAKER_03]: That helps you pan for the gold just like
you to know this can be successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do this together and it will be
good for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, it is now 428.
[SPEAKER_03]: 425, I think we nailed it, folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just genuinely want to thank the
audience, everybody that was here for
[SPEAKER_03]: participating in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for being part of our
panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a beautiful afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely, we'll stick around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Question or two?
I mean, if no one has a question,
you can all go to the bathroom.
