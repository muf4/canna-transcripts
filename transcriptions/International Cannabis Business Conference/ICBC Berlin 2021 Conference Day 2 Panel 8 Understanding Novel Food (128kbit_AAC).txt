[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome everybody to the Novel Food Panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Novel Food is a regulation that is
specific to the European Union.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still across Europe there are countries
that are not part of the European Union
[SPEAKER_04]: like the UK and Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those countries carry a different
regulatory framework even though they're
[SPEAKER_04]: dealing with the same ingredient.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to introduce to you three
knowledgeable speakers from Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany and Switzerland who will give you
great insight in their personal experience
[SPEAKER_04]: with Novel Food and some long-term
prospects for Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's start with Dr. Marieta Chesen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marieta works at Pharmaham since three
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Her current position at Pharmaham is Chief
Regulatory Officer.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's an expert in the field of global
legal requirements for cannabis related
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer products such as cosmetics,
food supplements and medicinal products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's the responsible person and
author of Pharmaham's application for the
[SPEAKER_04]: authorization of Novel Food that were
successfully submitted to the EC and UK
[SPEAKER_04]: FSA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have Mr. Kai Friedrich Nieman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kai Friedrich is a specialized lawyer for
hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kai is a member of the International
Cannabis Bar Association and working with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis companies across the globe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kai puts his energy into sustainably
establishing a cannabis industry as one of
[SPEAKER_04]: the most significant industries of the
future.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Kai is working with different clients
that are in the process of the Novel Food
[SPEAKER_04]: application.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have Dr. Francis Galen and
he's the Founder and Managing Director of
[SPEAKER_04]: Cloud9 in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: A life science company focused on the
development and commercialization of
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals based
on medicinal plants, particularly
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's best experienced in fast moving
consumer goods, tobacco,
[SPEAKER_04]: phyto-pharmaceuticals, flavors and so on
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's get started.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kai, can you give us maybe a quick
overview on what Novel Food is and what
[SPEAKER_04]: the process of the applications are at the
moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last time I sat here at ICBC was April
2019, three months after the Novel Food
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we predicted at that time that strict
law enforcement measures will take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They took place till now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before January 2019, the Novel Food
entry was that CBD is not a Novel Food
[SPEAKER_00]: unless it doesn't exceed the natural
content of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was a very broad definition,
not very precise, but the industry could
[SPEAKER_00]: live with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had a 2.5, 5% CBD oil,
it would have been marketable by that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then intense discussions between
several European member states took place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain started that in August 2018 and
removed all CBD products from the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went on with Austria in December 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saying that a general decree issuing to
the governors of the municipalities saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that they should enforce the Novel Food
directive because all the CBD oils were
[SPEAKER_00]: deemed as Novel Food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had the change in the catalog
in January 2019 addressing now all
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All extracts of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter which kind of
cannabinoid it can be CBD, CBG,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these extracts of cannabis from
then on Novel Food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had in Germany the public
announcement by the Federal Office of
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumer Protection saying that there is
no constellation possible where a product
[SPEAKER_00]: as food is marketable when containing CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the end of the CBD industry
we helped to know or we had known so far
[SPEAKER_00]: to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then IHA, the European Industrial Hemp
Association decided in June 2019 to start
[SPEAKER_00]: a joint application procedure.
[SPEAKER_00]: IHA by now has over 300 members taking
part in this consortium, in this Novel
[SPEAKER_00]: Food joint application consortium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every company can take part in this
consortium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the aim was to collect 3 million,
3.5 million euros for conducting several
[SPEAKER_00]: talk studies which are necessary to get
the approval by EFSA for these joint
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And IHA has achieved that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are one third of the way right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are four applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this Novel Food joint application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's isolate, it's raw product,
it's a gold extraction, and it's a raw
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all decarboxylated, but the raw
one is not distillated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Information you can see on IHA webpage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the procedure started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the talk studies are prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And IHA is starting now in the concrete
phase of really doing the talk studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting with animals later on in the
later stage, also with human exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's the status.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen a couple of circumvention
strategies in the market from labeling as
[SPEAKER_00]: cosmetic, as aroma extract, as aroma
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the next two years will be very
difficult for the companies to stay on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market to keep their products on the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, the fully potential of the
CBD market will unlock with the approval
[SPEAKER_00]: by EFSA for Novel Food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until then, yeah, let's see how it
works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Francis, you're a Swiss company,
but you're also looking at the UK market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you maybe give us a quick update on
what is happening in the UK?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I was calling some friends of
mine this morning to find out,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was checking also the website of the
EFSA to find out if there was anything
[SPEAKER_01]: new.
[SPEAKER_01]: There hasn't been anything new since April
26th when they published a document
[SPEAKER_01]: listing the, I think, four different
companies that have had their applications
[SPEAKER_01]: validated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I make the difference between
validated and authorized because to date,
[SPEAKER_01]: no products have been authorized by the
EFSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still seem to be quite far away
from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the products, I think there weren't
that many, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them were synthetic CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the echoes that I get from the UK
market, it's looking that authorities are
[SPEAKER_01]: more favorable towards synthetic to any
broad spectrum extracts or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: distillates like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also heard that in terms of process,
and we were talking about it just before,
[SPEAKER_01]: normally the EFSA, they said they were
going to publish the list of companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that have had their applications
validated.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that list hasn't changed since
April 26th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems to be in delay in terms of the
publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EFSA are not keeping to the process
that they wanted to engage with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I can understand that maybe
there are some legal implications as well
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of when the authority is
publishing a list of companies that also
[SPEAKER_01]: has implications for business and
commerce, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can understand maybe the FSA are a
little bit hesitant to continue down the
[SPEAKER_01]: road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And naturally, they're probably in
communication with the people in Brussels
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: To try and maybe harmonize actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no real news from the UK side
of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm a Swiss company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make Swiss chocolate with a broad
spectrum extract in it, a CBD extract,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I can only sell in jurisdictions
where novel foods authorization is not
[SPEAKER_01]: required.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm waiting, actually, for my
suppliers to get their authorizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I can make my application from my
chocolate to the authorities and get on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm at the end of the value chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm the customer of people like
Margrethe here who are really at the coal
[SPEAKER_01]: face tackling all the issues with the
authorities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayita, you have submitted applications to
both authorities in the UK and the
[SPEAKER_04]: European Union.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your experience with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And are there many differences?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how the applications are?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that is correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have applied at Farmerham to different
applications, novel food applications,
[SPEAKER_02]: to both authorities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been over half a year now since that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what regards the approaches that both
authorities are taking, basically,
[SPEAKER_02]: the rules apply which do apply are the
same.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both follow EU regulation on novel
food.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both follow EU guidances for the
novel food.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, when it comes to the CBD
products, there are slight differences
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have observed.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is definitely the approach
that FSA, so Food Standards Agency,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the UK has taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically left on the shelves the CBD
products that are, at the moment,
[SPEAKER_02]: related to the novel food applications
that were submitted before the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: March this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: This rule has slightly changed,
as you probably know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first announcement of the FSA was that
the novel food applications have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: actually validated in order to have the
products legally on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has changed in the middle of March.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the authorities didn't cope with
the amount of applications that they were
[SPEAKER_02]: receiving by that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've changed it to just submit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as my colleague here says before,
this is kind of related probably to the
[SPEAKER_02]: fact that it's just too many applications
over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one of the main changes,
I would say, when we compare EC or FSA to
[SPEAKER_02]: the UK Food Standards Agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one is the public list that we
also already discussed.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that EC hasn't
considered yet and probably won't
[SPEAKER_02]: consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the case of UK, authorities try to
be more market-oriented, or how to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the list indeed hasn't changed till
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are five companies there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 50 products that have passed
the validation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The public list contains also additional
lists with the on-hold applications,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also that part hasn't been updated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically it's empty since the
announcement of that public list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it looks like something is on hold by
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not by them, not by the applications
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one which I found quite
interesting is the fact that the rapid
[SPEAKER_02]: alert system for food and feed,
which is RASF system in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you check the notifications on that
portal, you can see that unauthorized use
[SPEAKER_02]: of CBD products is relatively often on the
list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So authorities in EU members are kind of
dealing with the CBD products on the
[SPEAKER_02]: market, but I've been following also the
FSA list or their announcements,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there hasn't been any recall or any
unauthorized use published on their
[SPEAKER_02]: webpage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is another thing that we can say
that's different in the case of UK.
[SPEAKER_02]: This might be again related to the fact
that they are putting everything on hold,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, because they are not really... I
think they have a lot of other things to
[SPEAKER_02]: do as well because of the Brexit,
and they are basically quite busy at the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we see there's apparently there is a
delay as well as in the UK, as well as in
[SPEAKER_04]: European Union.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kai, what are the biggest important
factors that can delay the process when it
[SPEAKER_04]: comes to noble food?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you know how many applications have
been handed in in total with the FSA and
[SPEAKER_04]: the European Commission, and what the
current status is there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the exact number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to find the exact number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 50 probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ask about the delay, that's a good
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a lawyer, not a scientist,
but the talk studies will be the crucial
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the biggest talk study on THC
commissioned by AIHA, which there has ever
[SPEAKER_00]: been.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I assume that on the way, on this talk
studies, there will pop up problems which
[SPEAKER_00]: no one expected and which have to be
solved then, and which maybe can delay the
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only about CBD, this noble food
joint application.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also about THC, which is just as
important because we have these strict THC
[SPEAKER_00]: thresholds for food.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the European Union, the so-called ARFD
by FSA, the acute reference doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these reference doses is so low that
you hardly can put a product on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to fear to break these
threshold and to have a callback by the
[SPEAKER_00]: authorities, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the aim of AIHA is to increase this
threshold by seven times so that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: seven microgram per kilogram body weight
as a daily intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can work with these
threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what pops up in this process,
in these toxicological studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe Marieta knows about that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all confident that they will be
conducted successfully and on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't know what FSA comes up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, that's not sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add something on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do this, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't tell that right now, but we are
confident that the process will be
[SPEAKER_00]: finished within 2023.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Marieta, what do you think are
important factors that will help to get a
[SPEAKER_04]: successful approval?
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe you can tell us a little bit
what you've done for your noble food
[SPEAKER_04]: application and what steps you had to go
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so rule number one followed EFSA's
requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is the most important one
with all the notes that they put in the
[SPEAKER_02]: guidances.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really want to know everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: For now, we've been in communication with
both the FSA and EFSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really, if they say, you know,
preferably five batches, you need to do
[SPEAKER_02]: the analysis on all five batches.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing, yeah, regarding our status,
we have both applications in the
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-evaluation step and the EFSA
suitability check.
[SPEAKER_02]: For that one, which is now in the phase of
EFSA suitability check, we are basically,
[SPEAKER_02]: we are having a TC conference with EFSA
authorities.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will give us some further
clarification on their requirements that
[SPEAKER_02]: have been submitted to us in August.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm having this conference,
which is part of EFSA supporting
[SPEAKER_02]: initiative in September.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But usually they are quite, they do
respond to our questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do try to answer also our questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a constant communication with
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same goes with FSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do respond.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Francis, let's say in the UK,
noble food applications go through,
[SPEAKER_04]: like if any, but will this do you think if
it will have any impact on the European
[SPEAKER_04]: market, if there are products approved
with noble food in the UK?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a crystal ball, but I would
imagine absolutely yes, because I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're the biggest trading partners
between the UK and the EU anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to have to be some sort
of a harmonization there between the two
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the FSA will come first before
the EU because the EU seemed to be I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know, on life support.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, nothing coming out of
Brussels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say you have good communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't seem to be making much
progress, right, at the EU level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, last year, you remember they
put all the dossiers on hold, the 50 or so
[SPEAKER_01]: dossiers back in, when was it,
March last year, because they had the
[SPEAKER_01]: preliminary review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember the legal review from the
Digisante and they said that it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had to wait until November
when it came out from the European Court
[SPEAKER_01]: of Justice that, okay, it's not a
narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what two or three days later the
European Commission came out with their
[SPEAKER_01]: statement saying, okay, all the dossiers
are back in progress again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since November, nothing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the UK get ahead in the race to
actually develop this market in Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure there's going to be a
consequence, going to be an impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think we should be more pushing
from the industry side that we get some
[SPEAKER_04]: results and that there is more progress?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think we should push more?
[SPEAKER_01]: At European level?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, at European or general market level.
[SPEAKER_04]: General market level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's being done by your
colleagues in EIHA, they're doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some other associations very
active in Brussels and companies also in
[SPEAKER_01]: private, Canadians, they have offices set
up in Brussels and they're doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: lobbying in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anyone's listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I have most of my doubts,
yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think the UK, their
authorities, I think they received
[SPEAKER_01]: something over 800 applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them didn't even get past the RF
number when they registered.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you register online your application,
you get an RF number and then you go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the companies didn't get to
the next step because they didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: their application.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have their applications done
the right way, like you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't really say any more than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's jump a little bit to another
topic, but that goes to the same
[SPEAKER_04]: authority.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about health claims and false
advertisement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kai, what is the problem with this from a
legal perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is the third obstacle of the
CBD business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is novel food.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second is THC and the third is health
claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started to work in the industry 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that time I didn't know what CBD is
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone asked me, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it legally?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the work started and we jumped in
as lawyers together and to collect the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal framework, what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you saw the boom, the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So numbers skyrocketing, the sales
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this product is so popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people having so many expectations
for their life, for their well-being,
[SPEAKER_00]: for their homo statis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't explain it to myself today,
even today that is so popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by that expectations you have at this
product, it's just one step to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: health claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for your homo statis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a borderline case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you start, it's good for cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for even COVID-19 maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a clear health claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that you need to have authorization
for that product according to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicines Act in the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the marketing departments from
the companies coming and asking,
[SPEAKER_00]: what can we say?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to say something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our CEO needs some bullet points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they set up on their webpages
like CBD question and answer areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are describing the history of
CBD, the possible designation areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do that, I can tell you,
if you get in the eye of the authorities
[SPEAKER_00]: and they find these question and answers,
these tips, these areas on your webpage,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will designate your product as a
medicine and you have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the big problem of the whole
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a wonderful product.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can't tell why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've set up a nice brand and nice
graphics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a nice shop in Berlin or what
is it, a fleck store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything looked nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people coming in, and you can't
tell them what this is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And will only be solved if there might be
a health claim accepted and will be
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted by the EU Commission and will be
listed in the EU health claim catalogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then might be one day this problem will
solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't look like this right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Marieta, how are you dealing with
functional health claims?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is your opinion on the issue of
false claims?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this issue is a bit more
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not related only to the CBD products.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically related to all consumer
products that can be purchased nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: The kind of new miracles that cure cancer
appear almost every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is a common problem of
false claims for the whole industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just the CBD industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the EU, like it was mentioned before,
we do have an established system of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutritional claims.
[SPEAKER_02]: The claims that you know, like low-fat,
low-sugar claims, which can be completely
[SPEAKER_02]: legally used for certain products under
certain circumstances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same goes with the health claims.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a register, EU register of
authorized health claims, such as the
[SPEAKER_02]: claims that are used typically for
vitamins for minerals, which can be
[SPEAKER_02]: legally used.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without breaching any law.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to the CBD, it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no authorized claim for the
moment available in the EU.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we at PharmaHemp have decided to go a
step further and start with the project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another application for the authorization
of the health claim that will be related
[SPEAKER_02]: or is related to the certain condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm personally involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna be the author of this health
claim authorization dossier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I must say that this is even more
complex project and even more demanding
[SPEAKER_02]: task than the novel foods, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Partially, this is related also to the
fact that the new transparency regulation
[SPEAKER_02]: came into force.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has happened this March.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the whole process,
because of that new regulation,
[SPEAKER_02]: is even more difficult and even more
complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we will try to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on this project now for a few
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an interesting new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of clinical data has to be reviewed,
but we'll see how fast will I be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, we'll submit the application by
the end of this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Francis, how are you dealing with
health claims?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't make any health claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: We comply with the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, when I started my journey,
also back in 2017, the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: the first thing I did was I went and met
with my local authorities in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, what do I need to do to comply
with the law?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they said things like, well,
it has to be a EU certified hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be a traditional extraction
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't contain any THC, because in
Switzerland, we actually have a regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: in the contaminants direct ordinance for
contaminants and food products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for specific levels, unlike the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we actually have a regulation in
Switzerland for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, it's zero with a lot of
decimal points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no health claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the final thing they said to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, you cannot make a health claim,
because it's a food product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It falls under food law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I add one more thing, though?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to follow on what Margretta was
saying about the category of vitamins,
[SPEAKER_01]: probiotics, because that's a nice category
where if you do get a product approved,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we are actually in the process of
doing that in Canada at the moment for our
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate, not the CBD one, but using hemp
seed oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using the nutritional properties
of hemp seed oil as a super food to also
[SPEAKER_01]: get it approved as a natural health
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in Health Canada, they have that
category of NHPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we can also sell our chocolate in
pharmacies or parapharmacies or health
[SPEAKER_01]: food stores and make health claims.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe again to you, Francis,
maybe you are brave enough to look in the
[SPEAKER_04]: glass bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how long do you estimate will it take
to get the first approval of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: related novel food ingredients?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how long will it take to bring those
products to the consumer?
[SPEAKER_04]: And which products do you think will be
most likely authorized?
[SPEAKER_01]: My suppliers have been waiting a year and
a half, years, since they made their
[SPEAKER_01]: applications to the authority.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't wait until March.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made them already a year before in
the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with the European Commission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still waiting in Brussels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think anyone knows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vajita, do you think any products have a
better chance of getting faster approval
[SPEAKER_04]: over others?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is what we've discussed before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the synthetic CBD is the most
prominent one.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, also with regards to natural hemp
derived products, I think that the
[SPEAKER_02]: isolated forms of CBD might be a bit
faster than the food spectrum or broad
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, this really depends on the
application itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's good quality application,
it might be faster and not rejected at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So another question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kai, what do you think, if there are
approvals of novel food applications,
[SPEAKER_04]: how will this affect all the other
companies who don't have approval?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we at IHA, we are assuming that
by these tox studies, which are conducted
[SPEAKER_00]: now, we will get all these applications
will get data protection according to
[SPEAKER_00]: Article 27 of the novel food directive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no other company can refer to the
results of these tox studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the licensees of IHA, of IHA Project
GmbH, can refer to these results for a
[SPEAKER_00]: period of five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all members now who joined the
consortium have a clear market advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: in this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the other companies which did it
on their own as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably you have to have a lot of data
and a lot of stock studies, and this data
[SPEAKER_00]: protection will be granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We assume that very, very strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all other companies which are not
licensed, but don't have any, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are not affiliated or associated to any
of the licenses of these novel food
[SPEAKER_00]: authorizations, will have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only IHA will kick them out or
will send them cease and desist letters
[SPEAKER_00]: for stopping distribution, the authorities
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still time to join IHA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can tell it's 2,500 euros for the
membership as a minimum fee below one
[SPEAKER_00]: million euro revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it increases the more revenue you
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stops at over 20 million revenue per
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be actually 190,000 euros.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pay that in three parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so it's 19,000 and 2,500 below
one revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fees will increase every half
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And IHA is still open for new members.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this consortium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I strongly recommend to organize something
like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're basically through with our
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this will leave us a little bit more
time for taking questions from the
[SPEAKER_04]: audience, if there are any.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it for Lisa and the panel so
far.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to all the panelists also.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this is an issue that Kai
brought up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think maybe Francis will be facing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, novel food is not just CBD,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going to happen in Switzerland as
of next year?
[SPEAKER_03]: How is food going with THC going to be
dealt with, or et cetera?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how, if any way, do you think that
path is going to be different?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start to answer that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what Marguerite is referring to is
since May the 15th in Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_01]: our Ministry of Health has opened to
receiving applications for a new Swiss
[SPEAKER_01]: pilot program that has been approved by
the government after a couple of years of
[SPEAKER_01]: going through the legislative process to
modify our narcotics law, allowing for a
[SPEAKER_01]: study to take place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a study, minimum five years,
to evaluate and to collect data on whether
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to legalize recreational cannabis
in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Switzerland loves to do referendums.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always doing referendums every three
months, practically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably in five years' time,
there's going to be a big referendum.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nice thing is that in order to change,
just to modify the narcotics law,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, a lot of the stakeholders in
Switzerland were favorable to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They allowed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The political parties and representatives
of the medical community so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting because we realize that in
Switzerland we have over 220,000 consumers
[SPEAKER_01]: of illegal cannabis in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a drop in the ocean anymore
for a population of nine million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a consensus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this also falls in line with
Switzerland's more progressive attitude
[SPEAKER_01]: for many years on drug laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea there, Marguerite,
is that it'll be under the protocols of a
[SPEAKER_01]: study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a scientific study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how we are being allowed now to
put products into the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is the participants of the
products now will be recruited by the
[SPEAKER_01]: study organizers, 5,000 participants per
study in all the cantons.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 26 cantons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do the math and you can see
what the potential market will be for this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So under that framework of a scientific
study, it's being approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from next year, we'll be able to put
into, actually, I'm starting now,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, because we have our application.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got nice news a few weeks ago that our
application to do a chocolate containing
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is now into the database and made
available to all the study organizers in
[SPEAKER_01]: the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be able to do a nice Swiss
chocolate with CBD and with THC for your
[SPEAKER_01]: pleasure and enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the CBD ones for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: Be brave.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one has questions at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even for maybe the recipe for the
Swiss chocolate with the CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much THC should I put in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're allowed up to 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up to 20%?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've become a lightweight now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like five milligrams per serving.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 10 little squares on our bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could do five migs per little square.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: You should almost do like one big per
little square because who's going to eat
[SPEAKER_05]: half of a bar?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to eat the whole bar and then
try to look for another one and then
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to smoke some weed and you're
going to eat three more.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: No questions at all?
[SPEAKER_05]: Closing statements?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish everybody success.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who has applied for Novel Food?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just play Bigo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it for everybody then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
