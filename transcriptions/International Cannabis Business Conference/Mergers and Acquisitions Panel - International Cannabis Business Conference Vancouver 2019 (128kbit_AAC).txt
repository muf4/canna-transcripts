[SPEAKER_04]: It's the M&A panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've got, we're chock full of
industry heavyweights for you here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will give you a quick introduction and
actually take it out to all these folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll take a minute or two to tell you
guys about themselves and their companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got Paul Brockman, I'm sorry,
Patrick Brockman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the other one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got Patrick Brockman,
who's the executive chairman of Pasha
[SPEAKER_04]: Brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrick, you want to say a couple words
about yourself here and what you guys do
[SPEAKER_04]: over at Pasha?
[SPEAKER_07]: Pasha is I think Canada's first
prohibition era brand house.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our approach to the market was to gather
the legacy growers, the brands that were
[SPEAKER_07]: on the shelves of dispensaries prior to
legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the same time, we took advantage of the
new regulations with Health Canada to
[SPEAKER_07]: allow for a micro cultivator or a craft
grower to get in the regulated economy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we bought an LP and instead of growing
flour, we're entering into supply
[SPEAKER_07]: agreements to purchase that flour from
craft growers across the country.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're the largest craft brand house.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the same time, we're aggregating all of
that production that is currently
[SPEAKER_07]: supplying 90% of Canadians' needs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my latest.
[SPEAKER_07]: A year ago, I was part of a company called
Doja Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a founding director and we got
really lucky.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lifestyle brand and I smoked my
first joint in grade seven and I've loved
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've made money with it and made love with
cannabis and it's been a really great
[SPEAKER_07]: experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so Canopy came knocking and gave the
shareholders a huge win and so that's kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of my latest thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love cannabis and I love the culture
that created this industry and I've taken
[SPEAKER_07]: an approach that is focused on that
community and helping them transition so
[SPEAKER_07]: that they can really take back that
industry that was stolen from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Patrick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've got Bobby Cause Paley from
Art Assets Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come out of the real estate and the fine
art worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started investing in cannabis five years
ago with my son.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was at that time cultivating about
5,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He now has licenses in LA and we've made
investments around the world in what I
[SPEAKER_00]: call an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the underpinnings are technology,
science, innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very interested in women and their
companies and their products and often
[SPEAKER_00]: invest in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the women she's interested in is
our own Jamie Pearson, the COO of Bang
[SPEAKER_04]: Corporation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Jamie Pearson, the COO of Bang
Corporation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bang is a publicly traded global house of
brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started with our award-winning
chocolate bar developed by a master
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolatier and have since evolved into
over a hundred skews.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are currently distributed in nine U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: states and nine foreign countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Canadian partner was on the previous
panel, Neil within Diva, and they've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: booth next door there so go check them
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bang really has a global vision for where
cannabis can be and we're executing that
[SPEAKER_02]: vision strategically and M&A is a huge
part of that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the daughter of a cultivator he's
been cultivating 55 years so I'm a
[SPEAKER_02]: second-generation cannabis person.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I made my way in business in real
estate and finance much like Bobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a real estate investor for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing those deals, going to get money for
deals came easy to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have real estate investments in three
countries so I've learned how to navigate
[SPEAKER_02]: rules depending on where we are,
the culture, the finance rules,
[SPEAKER_02]: the governmental rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So deals were coming across my desk in the
real estate space that had to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and obviously having a dad in
cannabis and being a business person in
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis space, I started seeing these
deals come across my desk and realized
[SPEAKER_02]: there was an opportunity for me to get
into cannabis directly and saw it for the
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity that it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be the next big global
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are all there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pre-prohibition but we can't put the
genie back in the bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are getting addicted to those tax
dollars and starting to see what cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: can do not only for governmental
organizations with funding but also we're
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing opioid addiction rates go down and
domestic violence go down and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to see the real benefits of this
magical plant and also the benefits in the
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental era that we can start
ushering in if we're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: responsible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit about my story.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit about Bang.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to be here and I'll turn it
over to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we've got Paul Peterson,
CEO, co-founder of NextLeaf.
Paul.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been in the industry for about six
years now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was initially working for Peace
Naturals.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were the first producer in Canada and
worked with the founders to sell the
[SPEAKER_06]: company to Kronos Group and started
NextLeaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our focus was to acquire and develop
extraction technology that we felt would
[SPEAKER_06]: lower the cost per milligram when you're
looking at CBD and THC as ingredients and
[SPEAKER_06]: obviously very excited for 2.0 products.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just announced a deal today with Bev
Canna, our now exclusive beverage partner.
[SPEAKER_06]: So very excited to start commercializing
some of our distillates and high purity
[SPEAKER_06]: oils through our manufacturing partners
that are now starting to come online.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just for a little context,
again, I'm Dean Arbit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I help run a couple entities.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is Wagner DeMoss, which is a company
that has developed and patented pre-roll
[SPEAKER_04]: technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: We operate with a licensee called Urban in
California, which rolls the most joints in
[SPEAKER_04]: the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we've licensed our technology to
Aurora here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other company is Bud.com,
which is a delivery and online retailer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm an investor and entrepreneur,
sort of all of the above, just to give you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys a little bit of context.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sort of jumping right in, we've got
two investors here, or operator investors,
[SPEAKER_04]: that are based in the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: And myself, that makes three.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we've got a couple Canadians,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So first question is, how does the
structure meaning if you're private or
[SPEAKER_04]: public, how does that affect M&A activity
from the standpoint of each of these
[SPEAKER_04]: companies?
[SPEAKER_04]: So kick it out to Patrick first.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you look at, based on how that
company is structured and where they are,
[SPEAKER_04]: how does that affect sort of your view of
them?
[SPEAKER_07]: Structure, from my perspective,
is looking at management and what kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: control does management have and how much
that management group has invested.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then outside shareholders is key for
longevity.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think those are probably the two most
important.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know that issued and outstanding
really is that relevant, but that's my
[SPEAKER_07]: take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Structure, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an investor without a fund this time,
so it's just my own money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tend to look very carefully at
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tend to usually want to work closely
with that management on expanding their
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's helping raise some more
capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: More often now it's cross-pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've just hit a little interesting
thing that I'm going to speak about,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it's quite private.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been invited on the board of a public
company so some of the companies that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: invested in I've brought to management and
we're negotiating very tightly for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we talk about structure,
I don't have a deal structure to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: these investments to the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm now thinking and wondering,
and I'd love any counsel from any of you,
[SPEAKER_00]: is what do I charge for my services since
I haven't gone on the board yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm acting, in fact, as an investor
broker to bring a company, a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: company, into the mix of a public company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love counsel on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an answer this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Bang went public through an RTO on the
CSC in July.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before that, obviously, we were a
privately held company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think our pre-public life was very
much developing our strategic plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we went through that going public
process, which was very painful,
[SPEAKER_02]: and if any of you are planning to do that,
please come talk to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, I learned a lot from that
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took a lot of people, a lot of
lawyers, and a lot of paperwork that,
[SPEAKER_02]: in retrospect, caused us to put a
strategic plan together that's very
[SPEAKER_02]: focused.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now our M&A look is focused on where
are those margin and revenue accretive
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities, where the fit is perfect
for what we need to grow bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not only looking to grow our top
line and our bottom line revenue,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're looking to grow our distribution
reach, and we're looking to grow our brand
[SPEAKER_02]: recognition reach, and we're looking for
companies that aren't looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody, I get a lot of this,
oh, I have this great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what they're saying is,
I developed a great product, I need money,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I need you to run my business for me
because I have a great idea in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't know how to run a business,
I don't know how to do marketing,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to get distribution,
and they basically want to bring me their
[SPEAKER_02]: great idea and help me make them
successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for companies that have a
value add for Bang that fills some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: gaps that we have so that these
acquisitions are strategic and fit well
[SPEAKER_02]: with what Bang has going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been a CPG company since day one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been putting consumer packaged
goods in the hands of consumers around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're very clear about what we need and
what lanes we're going into.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just acquired a beverage company called
Red Ace Organics, if any of you read that
[SPEAKER_02]: press release, we're excited about that
because it's professional athletes,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's Olympic athletes that are using these
products because they are, the new
[SPEAKER_02]: buzzword is aptogenetic functional
beverage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Ace has been selling these products in
the large chain distribution centers like
[SPEAKER_02]: Whole Foods, Sprouts, Amazon for years and
has this massive following of athletes
[SPEAKER_02]: that are using these products because they
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw that as an accretive acquisition
for Bang because it fit some holes that we
[SPEAKER_02]: had in our distribution plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what we're looking for prior
to going public.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just looked at every deal as we were
kind of figuring out who we wanted to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're clear about who we are and we're
going after it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess just to clarify and then we'll
take it out to Paul and actually maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: back to Patrick after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm talking about, do you as a public
entity look at Pubcos or private companies
[SPEAKER_04]: more favorably when you're looking at M&A
activity?
[SPEAKER_04]: So does that actually impact your decision
making?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, depending on the willingness of
management in a private company to engage
[SPEAKER_07]: with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think effectively, you'd want to
target something private.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamie?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big believer that you just look for
the win-win opportunity and where there's
[SPEAKER_02]: a meeting of minds where you've got
management that's really in sync with
[SPEAKER_02]: goals and aligned with I think the
philosophy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not looking for a money grab and
we're not out there just trying to gain
[SPEAKER_02]: top line revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out there really looking for,
like I said, those accretive acquisitions
[SPEAKER_02]: that make sense for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're private or they're public,
I'm going to take a look at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing deals for stock or cash or
both?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every deal is just like in real estate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every deal is its own animal and you got
to figure out what works for both people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm hearing is essentially it's
irrespective of the wraparound.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about what they're doing and the
team.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Paul, do you agree?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm clear though.
[SPEAKER_02]: A publicly traded company merging or
acquiring another publicly traded company
[SPEAKER_02]: or investing in or that gets very
complicated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Paul, you want to chime in?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say, for structure,
we always say that there's a lot of froth
[SPEAKER_06]: out in the market today.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at valuation or market cap
versus of a publicly traded company versus
[SPEAKER_06]: a private.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not a lot of fundamentals that
make sense right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a company with a $900 million
market cap that did $20,000 in cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: revenue the first six months of 2019.
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't mention the name, but I think what
we've seen in this industry is that
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a lot of companies that have been
structured to be publicly traded
[SPEAKER_06]: companies, to fool retail investors.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end of the day, this bubble is
going to pop in the sense that a bubble is
[SPEAKER_06]: created when you can finance a company on
storytelling.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the good thing is I think we're
getting to a place where having
[SPEAKER_06]: fundamentals to drive your business and
being able to put out a product that
[SPEAKER_06]: consumers want at a price that you guys
can make money at is something that is
[SPEAKER_06]: going to make sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we look at acquisitions, we look at
privately, private companies, we look at
[SPEAKER_06]: technology that's come out of the legacy
market in BC.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we've been very successful in
working with operators and entrepreneurs
[SPEAKER_06]: that maybe have needed help to
commercialize their technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is the thing that we love
about British Columbia is that there's
[SPEAKER_06]: some great operators and some very
experienced cannabis people in this
[SPEAKER_06]: province.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're really having fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: For us, we've been focused on intellectual
property, so not just acquiring
[SPEAKER_06]: technology, but filing patents around us.
[SPEAKER_06]: With the Altrias and the Constellation
brands of the world, we think that
[SPEAKER_06]: intellectual property really allows the
small guys to force the bigger guys to
[SPEAKER_06]: play nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul, you make a great point that right
now there is a flight to quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've started to see that away from these
bombastic, headline grabbing optical
[SPEAKER_04]: business models and really inflated
valuations based on top line revenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, are you guys seeing a shift in
focus with your companies more for
[SPEAKER_04]: profitability, engaging potential M&A
targets by their EBITDA and not top line?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's going to be really two.
[SPEAKER_07]: At least we've seen some acquisitions in
the last 12 months, but going forward,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that still many of the big five,
for example, are overpriced, overvalued,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they're still going to need to fill in
their balance sheet, backfill it with new
[SPEAKER_07]: assets that can support that valuation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that you're still going to see
that happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have to justify that,
but yeah, everyone's skating towards
[SPEAKER_07]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: With a limited market that Canada
presents, really the only choice if you're
[SPEAKER_07]: capitalizing structures, well,
is to be looking at US assets that are
[SPEAKER_07]: cash flowing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're legitimate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just look at the... There were two
acquisitions today, big.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're happening, but they're all US
assets right now because that market is
[SPEAKER_07]: under regulated relative to Canada,
so it makes for a safe haven for capital.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've seen the... If anyone's here
looking for money, I'm sure there are.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Canadian market, there's just been
a giant sucking sound and it's...
[SPEAKER_07]: The sound of money headed south and that's
where they wanna be because regulators are
[SPEAKER_07]: off our backs and people can function much
better relative to the Canadian market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so under regulated... Relative to
the Canadian market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still very regulated, but I think at the
end of the day, look, it's the consumer
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very mature consumer market and
there are companies making hundreds of
[SPEAKER_04]: millions of dollars off of in actual
revenue running their businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we don't see here.
[SPEAKER_07]: The California market is roughly the same
population as Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's six or seven thousands licensed
entities in California now and they do it
[SPEAKER_07]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got like what, two or 300?
[SPEAKER_07]: The numbers from retailing, it's like we
represent 13% of the population in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alberta, right across the border,
they're like, I think, like 4%.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got half the number of licensed
retail outlets for the whole country
[SPEAKER_07]: because the government is off
entrepreneurs' backs, so it's more
[SPEAKER_07]: successful and there's more cannabis being
sold in Alberta.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who woulda thunk, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's the relationship between
efficiency, capital, and the markets is
[SPEAKER_07]: where government is not intrusive,
you see progress being made.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people being able to create healthy,
safe products that don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: garbage packaging on that people want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your question essentially, to restate
it and correct me if I'm wrong,
[SPEAKER_02]: is putting it in Bang's perspective,
is Bang making different decisions now
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's pressure for us to be
looking for bottom line revenue as opposed
[SPEAKER_02]: to doing these willy nilly acquisitions
looking for top line revenue?
[SPEAKER_04]: Top line aesthetics, yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think from Bang's perspective,
we put together a really strong executive
[SPEAKER_02]: management team.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all shareholders, so the duty that
we have to shareholders is a duty we have
[SPEAKER_02]: to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are all very interested in Bang being
very successful, so when you come at that
[SPEAKER_02]: question of are we looking at bottom line
revenue, yes, we want to improve our cogs,
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to improve our top line revenue,
we want it to filter down so that all of
[SPEAKER_02]: us are making more money.
[SPEAKER_02]: That isn't just because we have a
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, there's a lot of
people trying to do these quick turn
[SPEAKER_02]: investments and there's a big short game
when you are in a small cap stock that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're watching because you make this
great announcement, your stock goes up,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then people sell, and because you
don't have that much volume trading,
[SPEAKER_02]: that one sale can affect your stock price.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very tenuous game that we're in,
but we just keep saying, I tell everybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody that works for me, don't look at
the stock price, make good decisions,
[SPEAKER_02]: because at the end of the day,
if you're running a good business and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're making good decisions, the stock
market becomes a weighing machine as
[SPEAKER_02]: opposed to that short term market has
spoken.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want our company to be heavy at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want us to be the biggest, baddest
company we can be, but that's Bang's
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective, and I know it's unusual,
but to answer your question, out in the
[SPEAKER_02]: marketplace, yes, I'm seeing a shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing these big companies and the
smaller, mid-cap stock companies are no
[SPEAKER_02]: longer just playing an M&A game.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not gaming it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're starting to see a push for bottom
line revenue, which I think will benefit
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry all the way through.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a sign of maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're at another stage also.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through a big investment cycle and
we sort of set the standards in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm seeing now is my investments are
maturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are opportunities for them to grow
and partner with others or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now I'm starting to look at the
Israeli scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm investing in a number of laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a honey product that will take a
long time, but will come to market,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I think that there's another shift
that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw the runoff of the Canadians of
becoming public, the stock market,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now for the investing crowd like me,
I think we want to see what's new and how
[SPEAKER_00]: do we integrate it in what we have and
where we think the market is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market is absolutely going to be a
consumer market, but we're also producing
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality, low cost products for seven
billion people in this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we as an industry have this
responsibility to take care of everyone,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just the luxury market, not just the
craft market.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an international product.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more point on that is that we're
having conversations internally on the
[SPEAKER_02]: executive team that there are a lot of
really good brands out there that are
[SPEAKER_02]: making excellent products that aren't
going to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're undercapitalized or they're in a
state where the moons aren't lining up for
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also watching those brands very
closely because we know that there are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be opportunities for us to come
in and not contrary to what I said before
[SPEAKER_02]: where I want brand, I want to do M&A
activity that's actually beneficial to
[SPEAKER_02]: bang or plugs a hole or is a natural fit,
but we're also looking and seeing really
[SPEAKER_02]: smart people with really good brands that
aren't going to make it where we've got
[SPEAKER_02]: our eye on them too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's another shift in what's
happening in the investment space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and I think that in these investments
that I'm making, it's sometimes not just
[SPEAKER_00]: the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the talent, the talent and the
passion and their ability to pivot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring in that IP to my company and it
can be utilized in other products and
[SPEAKER_00]: services.
[SPEAKER_04]: Synergizing across all your entrepreneurs.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take it out to a different facet of
how the industry is growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about different products in
verticals that right now you guys see as
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of the fastest growing, the comers.
[SPEAKER_04]: What verticals, specific sectors in the
space?
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear a lot about beverages.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been obviously something that's
been out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy to start with Paul on this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have something for us, Bud?
[SPEAKER_06]: For us, we've really looked at
intellectual property as being an area
[SPEAKER_06]: that I think there's going to be a lot
more focus on.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Canada, at least, it's all been about
growing plants because the 2.0 products
[SPEAKER_06]: haven't been legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we look at other industries,
biotech, life sciences, pharma,
[SPEAKER_06]: intellectual property tends to play a big
role in M&A activity, but also in
[SPEAKER_06]: shareholder value.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for us, we've said from day one,
let's not reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go out there and acquire
intellectual property from guys that have
[SPEAKER_06]: built it in an unregulated marketplace.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's further develop it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's scale that with our engineers and
file intellectual property around it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We see these downstream formats that lead
to more mass market appeal being what I
[SPEAKER_06]: think a lot of companies are going to be
really focused on, whether that's through
[SPEAKER_06]: acquisition or developing those in-house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even your example with the joint roller
that you've licensed to Aurora,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's these new formats that maybe
companies don't have that expertise or
[SPEAKER_06]: they don't have that technology in-house.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to go to another market,
whether it's the US or elsewhere,
[SPEAKER_06]: and look at licensing or acquiring it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the new formats, at least in
Canada, are going to really change how
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis is consumed.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you think about where cannabis needs
to go today to where it needs to go,
[SPEAKER_06]: let's call it 10 years from now,
is mass market appeal isn't going to be in
[SPEAKER_06]: the plant being smoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be in all the nonsmokables
that the baby boomers and today's
[SPEAKER_06]: non-consumers get comfortable with
consuming through that method.
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Paul alluded to our IP on the
pre-roll side.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually use that IP as a form of
non-dilutive financing when we licensed
[SPEAKER_04]: our tech and got an eight-figure sum back
with the royalty from Aurora.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, I would very much agree,
me being a bit tainted, but IP is
[SPEAKER_04]: something that I see as something that
will differentiate beyond what right now
[SPEAKER_04]: is on the market, which are essentially a
lot of commoditized solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's selling the same things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, how do you do it a little
better?
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, your point?
[SPEAKER_02]: We always quote this famous Henry Ford
saying where he said, if I had asked
[SPEAKER_02]: customers what they wanted, they would
have said, a faster horse.
[SPEAKER_02]: He invented the car, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're saying in that regard, customers
don't know what they want because they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't necessarily look at the environment
and think what's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our job is to see what's possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those low barrier to entry delivery
systems are kind of a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The European, American, Canadian consumer
already alters their brain with beverage.
[SPEAKER_02]: They already use wine and beer and alcohol
to relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to picture my mom out there with a
dab rig and a blowtorch, and she's
[SPEAKER_02]: probably not going to be dabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neither am I.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you know, I did it once with my
dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not good, and I'm not going to dab
ever again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But beverages, I think- Note to self.
[SPEAKER_02]: Note to self.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever want to know, just come ask
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the beverage side of things,
I think we can all wrap our brain around,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think the beverage companies are
trying to figure out how do- In fact,
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby and I were talking about this in
Palm Springs last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was how do I go drinking with my
friends, and I want to have two or three
[SPEAKER_02]: beverages and get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get drunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I like the way cannabis makes me
feel, and I want to go have that social
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the companies that are figuring
out how to do what consumers want and do
[SPEAKER_02]: it right, probably with IP.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Bang's been an IP company,
that's how we've spread our message and
[SPEAKER_02]: our footprint is through licensing IP the
same way Wagner-Demus has.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also, we see skincare, beauty products,
men's grooming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a female skincare line and a
men's grooming line coming out,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's a low barrier to entry.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are already doing that,
and dog treats and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things that they do with their pets,
if we can figure out a way to enhance
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers' lives in a way that's already
accessible and easy and that they
[SPEAKER_02]: understand, I think the most important
piece though is that the products have to
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where, to Bobby's point,
we have a responsibility to be using good
[SPEAKER_02]: active ingredients, and the products need
to be safe, and it can't just be lip
[SPEAKER_02]: service.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be what we're really doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the other thing that I'm on a
quest for is to solve problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I think that osteoporosis is
a gigantic problem in the world when you
[SPEAKER_00]: think of people over 50 and the diets that
we use and so forth, and how it's breaking
[SPEAKER_00]: down bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at endometriosis and other
glaucoma, other issues that are
[SPEAKER_00]: international issues for the population
that we can solve with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a consumer game,
but it's also solving the problems that we
[SPEAKER_00]: all face in some way with a female plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick?
[SPEAKER_03]: Science and technology.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to agree with everything that's
been said.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm most excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a flower guy, but I recognize in the
beverage category that if you can create a
[SPEAKER_07]: new uptake technology so that you're
getting high in three minutes and you can
[SPEAKER_07]: continue and vibing without getting
higher, but I think that means that the
[SPEAKER_07]: beverage has to have a rich cannabinoid
and rich terpene recipe, because that's
[SPEAKER_07]: what I want in the cannabis experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want just a THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's technology, and I think that's one
of the really exciting things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really think that we're in the infancy
of an industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you wanna use a metaphor as a ball
game, I think we're in the third inning,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's just starting.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many incredible things that are
gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: We look at the euphoria that's been in the
cannabis market over the last couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: years, but that's that.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the end of the day, there's still
millions of people that are gonna be
[SPEAKER_07]: consuming cannabis, so that market's not
changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just looking at the stock market and
all of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The underlying market is people and
products that provide a meaningful
[SPEAKER_07]: resolution to health issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the end of the day, this is a beautiful
part of Mother Nature, and this is a gift.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's our obligation to share that gift in
our individual way, whether it's
[SPEAKER_07]: technology and brands and products.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we start talking about how we convey
this message and how we educate and form,
[SPEAKER_04]: a big part of that are mass communications
channels.
[SPEAKER_04]: That in the US is challenging,
and in some ways in Canada is even more
[SPEAKER_04]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: The restrictions on marketing,
advertising.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love some quick input on how that
fractures the entire playbook here,
[SPEAKER_04]: the restrictions on messaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now in our industry, relative to
most anyone can say anything in their
[SPEAKER_04]: space, we can't.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is probably one of the most negative
parts of the Cannabis Act and the
[SPEAKER_07]: regulations in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a huge blow to the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: As business people, we're artists.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're creating something that we have for
the rest of the world, and then you've got
[SPEAKER_07]: this body that's saying, no, no,
no, you can't say that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at this wrapping that they're making
you put in.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the worst thing in the world,
yet they're making these the laws,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's not what we would choose if it
was us making the regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because it's them making the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: An ex-police chief, he was the guy that
was appointed to head up the discovery of
[SPEAKER_07]: regulations, and he was a prohibitionist,
so what else are you gonna get?
[SPEAKER_07]: In a decade, the people sitting up on the
panel at the next ICBC in Vancouver in 10
[SPEAKER_07]: years will be talking about the old days
when it was crazy, but it's gonna get
[SPEAKER_07]: better.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just gonna take a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's what I would say about branding,
and obviously it's very restrictive in
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada on what you can put on your
packaging, but the reality is that the
[SPEAKER_06]: best weed that's ever been sold in this
province is coming from a clear plastic
[SPEAKER_06]: baggie.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reality is that product quality sells
itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think actually the regs
disproportionately affect the big
[SPEAKER_06]: producers, the guys that have found a way
to work around no celebrity endorsements,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they've got the rappers and everybody
else on their label, but it's hard to sell
[SPEAKER_06]: schwag when you can't do the same type of
marketing that big alcohol and big tobacco
[SPEAKER_06]: and big CPG can do, so it really comes
down to what's inside that packaging,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think we've seen some craft
producers, small LPs that have done
[SPEAKER_06]: exceptionally well over the last five
years, and I think we're very excited to
[SPEAKER_06]: now see companies that can put out a great
flower and now soon in a few months a
[SPEAKER_06]: great 2.0 product that will get consumers
to gravitate, but it's gonna absolutely be
[SPEAKER_06]: very difficult to build a brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're gonna see a lot of brands
actually get created in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: to get brought to Canada, not that
dissimilar from other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That question brings me back to Palm
Springs last week where I just will tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you I'm so grateful to be in this
industry, and five years ago, six years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago, whatever it was when I got into it,
I was nervous about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd come out of a really conservative
spot, and bottom line is I saw the future
[SPEAKER_02]: in Palm Springs, and it blew my mind,
and if you have a chance, you need to look
[SPEAKER_02]: up the Knox doctors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a family of doctors, Jessica,
Rachel, and Janice Knox, and there's two
[SPEAKER_02]: more doctors, but the three women were
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a women's conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're endocannabinologists.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them was an anesthesiologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one was integrative medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all three physicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's five Knox physicians in this
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are figuring out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all went back and figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the endocannabinoid system has
receptors in the heart and in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know this, but we all know that we
don't know what we don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the future of CPG, the Knox doctors are
gonna bring us there, because what's gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: happen is we're gonna start to understand,
oh, I have infertility problems,
[SPEAKER_02]: or I have Crohn's disease, or something
autoimmune, and there is some
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid reason that because we
don't have access to this research,
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're gonna be able to say,
oh, your CB1 receptor needs to get this
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid or this terpene,
but you're trying to get pregnant,
[SPEAKER_02]: so let's make sure we're not doing this to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have access to that level of
research yet, but it's coming,
[SPEAKER_02]: and these women are superstars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go check them out, because they are going
to lead the physicians in this nation to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure that out, and that's what's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, we're talking about marketing
and what we can and can't do with
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's information that's going to
drive consumers, that's going to drive
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely, and we're not just talking
about logos.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's to be able to compel folks to
understand what's in this product,
[SPEAKER_04]: and having hands tied is brutal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unlike any other vertical,
and I'll say beyond that high level
[SPEAKER_04]: messaging, you're also talking about being
blocked off, essentially not have access
[SPEAKER_04]: to massive platforms, social media,
Google, who everyone's got access to but
[SPEAKER_04]: us, and that's a massive problem for us in
the US as well, so where it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily regulation or health
disclaimers, we deal with that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't make health claims.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have people that say, I can't sleep
without cannabis, but we can't make health
[SPEAKER_02]: claims about our products, but we know
people are using it for anxiety,
[SPEAKER_02]: pain relief, all of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't talk about it, so we can't give
consumers good information about dosing
[SPEAKER_02]: and usage and health benefits because we
can't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't have access to platforms,
so I just want us to think bigger as an
[SPEAKER_02]: organization, as an industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, it comes down to giving these
folks just the opportunity to choose this
[SPEAKER_04]: natural product versus other solutions
that are being pumped by other industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we don't have the right to do
right now, in my opinion, to the degree
[SPEAKER_04]: that we should.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about Canada and the US,
but I think we need to look at this as a
[SPEAKER_00]: global industry and a global set of
products that we're developing as brands
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be used everywhere, just setting
the stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Bobby, it's all emanating from the US
and Canada, so they're all going to run
[SPEAKER_04]: into the same issues when their market
matures to that level, so if we execute on
[SPEAKER_04]: this and start to solve it in the US and
Canada, those solutions will emanate out,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, when they adopt.
[SPEAKER_07]: I look at it in two ways, right now and
currently and for the foreseeable future.
[SPEAKER_07]: Entrepreneurs are going to be frustrated
by regulations and regulators.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a decade, many of the regulations that
are obstructing us will be gone,
[SPEAKER_07]: but the beautiful thing about it is that,
and Brother Marley taught us this,
[SPEAKER_07]: is that cannabis represents the truth,
and that's why it's been part of the
[SPEAKER_07]: prohibition agenda to keep you away and
keep us away from that which represents
[SPEAKER_07]: the truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: They wanna segregate us so that we're
actually not seeing reality and seeing the
[SPEAKER_07]: truth, and so it's out, and that's what's
happening now, and it's saving lives,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's changing lives, it's making people
wealthier and happier and getting them off
[SPEAKER_07]: that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That Big Farm is pushing on us and is
protected by, through regulations,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's just a matter of time,
the truth is out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if we've quoted Bob, we've gotta
end it at that, because I think it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna go past that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll say this, it is hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna get easier, but everyone's
getting their legs now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You build your company when it's hard,
because it is hard, and you persevere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get it done, and that's why you're
all in this room, doing it when it's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys will get the benefit of that,
we all will.
[SPEAKER_04]: With that said, we've got a couple more
minutes, and in Gaio, this is gonna be
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: One more time for Dean and the entire
panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's got a question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Question, question, anyone have a
question?
[SPEAKER_05]: You've all been super well informed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing, it's very comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, that's fine with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care, oh, no, here, yes,
yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there you are, I didn't see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here I go, come on, come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we gotta figure out a way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scooch in, scooch in, make a hole,
let go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question, oh, I haven't spoken on
one of these before.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is to Patrick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that Pascha Browns is very,
they really look at the culture of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, where it's come from,
the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you encourage small families or
all retail business owners that don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years to put money in to the business
and wait for the payoff, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you opening a store?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a license, and my mom and I own a
store in Abbotsford.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and it's gray market right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and you're asking how to navigate
the time to.
[SPEAKER_07]: How to navigate it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're saying the payoff is gonna
say 10 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's miserable, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give her a better answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you encourage us?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we get excited about this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Retail is gonna be miserable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tilray just paid $70 million like last
week or the week before for 20 locations
[SPEAKER_07]: in Alberta, because Brendan is a very
smart guy, and he's not waiting for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going after a market that exists
today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are your doors open still?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even just asking for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm asking for the community of small
business owners.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the business community that's
represented the gray market, they're
[SPEAKER_07]: survivors.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're smarter than the regulated group
because they've been having to dodge and
[SPEAKER_07]: weave for all this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep fighting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I say my t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay gray and keep the lights on.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let Health Canada and regulators prove to
you that they're actually doing what
[SPEAKER_07]: they're supposed to, which is opening
stores and letting people grow and just go
[SPEAKER_07]: toe to toe.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, all the change that's occurred in
Canada is Kirk and John and the lawyers,
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob Laurie is here as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the people that have really made
the effective change is, but it's been the
[SPEAKER_07]: community funding it and keeping it all
alive.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we're in the position we're in
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not because Harper and Trudeau
actually care.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys are in a place where it's
essentially it's what California has done
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's a massive regulated market now,
but it started... You guys call it a gray
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't really have a name for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just what it was since 1996 when
Prop 215 came out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The medical market and a lot of those
survivors are now running some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: biggest compliant operators in the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hang in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for a great panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to ask all of you,
as you're considering brands that you're
[SPEAKER_08]: looking for, one of the strangest parts of
the shifting sands of Canadian commerce
[SPEAKER_08]: right now is the fact that the whole
medical industry seems to have been swept
[SPEAKER_08]: under the rug.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or normally forgotten.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm wondering in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: especially where you have more states that
are medical and recreational, how many of
[SPEAKER_08]: you are looking for brands that have
medical orientation versus recreational?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that as states in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: have opened up either regulated or fully
legal that the recreational market is both
[SPEAKER_00]: medical and recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm buying a medical product and I'm
in a legal state that sells recreational,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just buy my product that way,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we haven't... We don't
have the same differential in medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: fully legal that we had a couple of years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's an evolve... What I'm
saying is I believe it's an evolving story
[SPEAKER_07]: and that... Yeah, I don't think my medical
brand in Canada, if it's emerging,
[SPEAKER_07]: is valuable.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the United States, it's gonna be legal
federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe we need medical products as
we were talking about before.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need medical products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to solve ailments and diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's our responsibility as an industry
to take this female plant and find that
[SPEAKER_00]: research and do it and struggle with it
and bring it to market.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the overarching idea there is I
think exactly what Patrick said,
[SPEAKER_04]: in my opinion, there's now a... It's
blurred as far as do you want it medical
[SPEAKER_04]: or do you want it... Or someone looking
for medical driven products or is it
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's far and away the biggest market.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a question for us, medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: From Banks' perspective?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only one market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: From Banks' perspective, I don't know the
statistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure somebody out there can shout it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a statistic that says some
large percentage of recreational users are
[SPEAKER_02]: using cannabis for medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't need the brand, I think,
to Bobby's point, to be medically oriented
[SPEAKER_02]: because the consumer's deciding what
they're using it for, whether they're
[SPEAKER_02]: using it recreationally to get high with
their friends or they're using it to sleep
[SPEAKER_02]: or they're using it for pain relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the brand has to be compelling and
it has to be safe and it has to provide a
[SPEAKER_02]: service that people are looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you orient it medically,
I think you're leaving a lot on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: MJ Biz and New Frontier Data did a study
and they came out with a report called Arc
[SPEAKER_00]: Types.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the cost is these days,
but it's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a very valuable report because it
segments older users and different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a study that I have never seen
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry was astonished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you should all take a look at
it because what we're seeing is we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing many, many, many different niches
in the buying public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those niches will become forces as we
do our research and deliver more products
[SPEAKER_00]: to market, I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to cut everybody off, but we are
way over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was super great.
