[SPEAKER_04]: And the next panel is going to bring a
bunch of knowledge, and most importantly,
[SPEAKER_04]: has a moderator whose name I should not
butcher.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the moderator has worked for over 20
years in the music industry, which
[SPEAKER_04]: transitioned into working cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he has joined Hello Cannabis'
educational platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in 2017, he started managing Hello
Cannabis' Goodbye Opioid campaign,
[SPEAKER_04]: a very important campaign.
[SPEAKER_04]: And please give a warm welcome to Mr. Ben
Rispin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're following along in your guides,
you might notice there's a bit of a change
[SPEAKER_05]: in the schedule here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a transit issue, so two of the
physicians won't be here today.
[SPEAKER_05]: But my friend Bubba's going to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I assure you it was a transit issue,
and there was no procrastination due to
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Tamara, how are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have the esteem pleasure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also only found out because of this that
I was going to be moderating this panel
[SPEAKER_05]: last night.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you'll excuse me, I'm going to be
referring to my notes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the extreme pleasure of introducing
my colleagues here.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end, I have my dear friend Bubba
Nicholson.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubba played an integral role in bringing
the Movember campaign.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we familiar with Movember?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubba played an integral role in the early
success of the Movember campaign in the
[SPEAKER_05]: US.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Canada, he is a legend in the
networking hospitality industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is also the newly appointed president
of Hello Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please put your hands together for my
friend Bubba.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next to Bubba is Dr. Alan Greenspoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Alan Greenspoon is a family physician
with special interests in occupational
[SPEAKER_05]: health.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has been instrumental in leveraging
many key partnerships with corporate
[SPEAKER_05]: clients to maintain safe and productive
workplaces.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please put your hands together for Dr.
Alan Greenspoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next to Dr. Greenspoon is the founder and
chairman of Hello Cannabis Medical
[SPEAKER_05]: Education Centers, as well as founder and
president of GR Nurseries and Labs,
[SPEAKER_05]: a licensed producer focused exclusively on
medical genetic cultivation and
[SPEAKER_05]: propagation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said that right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So put your hands together for Stephen
Burby.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So without further ado, I'm just going to
hop right into the question or hop right
[SPEAKER_05]: into the interview and the questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's all right with you, it's going
to have to be because that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: going to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stephen, please tell us about the Canadian
medical landscape from the patient
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a medical cannabis patient for
about seven years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, and I did notice that there was quite
a lot of accessibility problems in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come from a world where we are the
second largest consumer of opioids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've personally seen it ravage a few
families, including some of my own
[SPEAKER_02]: members.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do believe that cannabis has a
massive potential to be able to curb the
[SPEAKER_02]: opioid epidemic that's now moving
globally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven years ago, I had sustained a very
traumatic injury that had put me on the
[SPEAKER_02]: equivalent of six milligrams of Dilaudid
every four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you that aren't familiar with
Dilaudid, it is worth, for every one
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram of morphine, Dilaudid is,
sorry, for every 5.5 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_02]: morphine, is the equivalent of one
milligram of Dilaudid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to transfer that to recreational use,
from what I've been told by physicians,
[SPEAKER_02]: is a recreational user would use two
milligrams of Dilaudid to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially, I was taking enough to get
high three times every four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a three-month prescription,
and I truly found that it was overkill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many people were not able to get off
that type of addiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in a privileged position to be able
to do that, and I'd love to touch on that
[SPEAKER_02]: story in a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, with respect to the medical
landscape in Canada, we did notice that
[SPEAKER_02]: there was not enough education,
there was not enough accessibility,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there was not enough physicians that
were knowledgeable or comfortable enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to prescribe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a relatively unknown substance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back seven years ago, there was less than
5% of physicians prescribing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As of last year, I believe there was nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are now, I believe, not working
linearly, but exponentially in starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: find that we are almost at 20% of
physicians that are more comfortable
[SPEAKER_02]: prescribing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I certainly don't want to take any
aggressive credit for this, but I do
[SPEAKER_02]: strongly believe that educational clinics
and support networks like Hello Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and many other clinics that are available
and spreading and growing in Canada will
[SPEAKER_02]: help these physicians get educated and
will be able to help them provide better
[SPEAKER_02]: duty of care for their patients,
and will ultimately allow for greater
[SPEAKER_02]: access.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dr. Jay-Z had the perfect segue into
this as he was stating that education is
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely pivotal in order to help
destigmatize cannabis and to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: help patients get access to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I truly believe that cannabis should
potentially be the first step to pain
[SPEAKER_02]: medication as opposed to an exit to
medication to deal with symptoms from
[SPEAKER_02]: opioid addiction, which is often the first
step that physicians are using to COPA to
[SPEAKER_02]: treat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fabulous, fabulous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you, from the Dr. Greenspoon,
the same question, but maybe from the
[SPEAKER_05]: physician perspective?
[SPEAKER_08]: My interest in cannabis started when I
realized that in my hometown, Hamilton,
[SPEAKER_08]: Ontario, at least one person died every
day from opiates.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Vancouver, British Columbia,
up to 10 people die every day from
[SPEAKER_08]: opiates.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the scary number is in the United
States, I've heard numbers up to every
[SPEAKER_08]: three weeks, the same number of people die
from opiates that died in the 9-11 Twin
[SPEAKER_08]: Tower disaster, but up to 2,700 people
every three weeks, 88 people a day.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I knew we had to do something about
opiates.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing is our College of
Physicians and Surgeons have come up with
[SPEAKER_08]: regulations and guidelines.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in British Columbia, they did a study,
a good study, evidence-based study,
[SPEAKER_08]: where they determined 100 milligrams a day
of morphine or that equivalent is safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in Ontario, they arbitrarily said if
100 milligrams a day is safe in British
[SPEAKER_08]: Columbia, the 90 milligrams will be safe
in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have to get our patients off
opiates.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we need to use other natural health
products, and cannabis is obviously a
[SPEAKER_08]: great opportunity.
[SPEAKER_08]: But as a general practitioner,
I'm a generalist, I'm not a specialist,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I needed to rely on educational
clinics to educate my patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I've looked to Hello
Cannabis to help me learn about cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: and help my patients learn about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bubba, this one's going to be for you,
pal.
[SPEAKER_05]: From your unique perspective, why do you
feel that education is so important for
[SPEAKER_05]: patients?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now with what's happening with the
stigma of cannabis, what we're finding out
[SPEAKER_07]: is that our patient age is about 54 to 60
years old is our average patient age
[SPEAKER_07]: coming into the clinics right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's a huge need for
information.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're taking a look at a generation of
people that have grown up through this
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis prohibition who have been told
that cannabis is the worst thing you could
[SPEAKER_07]: ever do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now they're starting to turn around.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we share this amazing information
and the right information, educate people,
[SPEAKER_07]: we're having them turn around and say,
well, maybe I'd like to take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in Canada, we're in sort of a neat
spot right now as we as we start to look
[SPEAKER_07]: at legalization, there's a lot of
information being shared.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's our job as well to take a look at
that information that's being shared on
[SPEAKER_07]: Facebook or wherever it is, and do the
research, because there's a lot of false
[SPEAKER_07]: information that's going on out there
right now as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the problem is that we're so quick to
just press send or, oh, Ben's my friend
[SPEAKER_07]: and I love Benny always prints funny
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going to send it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we got to start taking a look at
those articles because we're sending a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of false information out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's actually setting us back.
[SPEAKER_07]: The more we can talk about it,
the more we can have conversation about
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just going to find that more
physicians are getting into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I recently just had back surgery.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was on not as bad as Stephen,
but I was on gabapentin, 1200 milligrams
[SPEAKER_07]: of naproxen, hydromorphone, cotin,
hydromorphone, PMS.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and another pill as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I started using the cannabis oils.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got off of the 1200 milligrams of
naproxen almost within two weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the hydromorphone made me so dumb and
fuzzy headed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I started I started vaping a high CBD
cannabis at a low temperature for
[SPEAKER_07]: breakthrough pain.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took me off six extra pills a day just
by being able to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's having these conversations,
everybody telling their stories,
[SPEAKER_07]: sharing their stories about cannabis and
really just opening up that conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that's what's going to help us right
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're finding I spoke to two
physicians while I was going through.
[SPEAKER_07]: My surgeon is now on board with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's prescribing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's using Hello Cannabis to educate his
patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now he's off talking to physicians.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually starting a he just sent
me this yesterday.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're starting a clinical study on
prescriptions in the orthopedic settings
[SPEAKER_07]: on cannabis and treating musculoskeletal
pain.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just from a conversation where we
started talking about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: educating and now we're getting clinical
studies done right in our backyard.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty amazing.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please put your hands together.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was literally yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cried a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty big.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to add one more clinical trial
that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually do research in the delivery of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the reason that there hasn't been
tremendous clinical trials so far is
[SPEAKER_08]: because and still is cannabis is illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's hard to do large clinical
trials.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there have been lots of trials
around the world, particularly here in
[SPEAKER_08]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's there's evidence out of Australia
and Israel.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're starting a clinical trial on using
cannabis for acute pain management
[SPEAKER_08]: following surgery as well under the chief
of surgery at St. Joseph's Hospital in
[SPEAKER_08]: Hamilton.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's starting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it will happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: These trials are are happening all around
the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's our job out there as the cannabis
advocates in us to start sharing that
[SPEAKER_07]: information.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't we don't work at Hello Cannabis
and say we want to be the only cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: education clinic.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want everybody out there educating.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this conference and places like this
are amazing because we can start sharing
[SPEAKER_07]: that information.
[SPEAKER_07]: A study that happens in Germany is equally
as important in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to start sharing that
information and getting the good stuff out
[SPEAKER_07]: there so that people can see the
difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Steven, why is education important for
patient access from your perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I I'll touch on a very personal story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be candid, this is actually the
first time that I've said it in a public
[SPEAKER_02]: public setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a rather humbling experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can put all of these stereotypes
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up as an investment banker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a charter still am a charter
investment manager.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a derivatives trader and portfolio
manager for RBC Dominion Securities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Candidly, it's the largest investment firm
in Canada and was quite young at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Captain of the city championship soccer
team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, my head didn't fit through doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was an avid climber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very good at one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a split second, I was very,
very bad at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I fell 22 feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The injury I suffered was called bilateral
calcaneus fractures.
[SPEAKER_02]: In layman's terms, I shattered my feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to get carried out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thankfully, I spent six months in a
wheelchair and 17 screws was what was
[SPEAKER_02]: required to put my feet together that are
still present to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: My orthopedic surgeon, who's actually
participating in this clinical trial,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's the number one number one person on
that list, had stated that this is
[SPEAKER_02]: arguably one of the most painful surgeries
that you can endure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's essentially getting nailed to the
cross 17 times.
[SPEAKER_02]: With metal screws, it was rather
excruciating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I came out of this and I touched on
this earlier where I was taking six
[SPEAKER_02]: milligrams of Dilaudid every single four
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was literally in a comatose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had spent seven days completely in a
hospital bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to get transitioned to my home
where I was more or less horizontal for 23
[SPEAKER_02]: hours a day and literally had to relearn
how to time and learn to walk by crawling
[SPEAKER_02]: first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had I known that cannabis would have been
able to help offset the damage and
[SPEAKER_02]: addiction that comes with opioids,
you would damn well bet that I would have
[SPEAKER_02]: done this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm extremely grateful that we are now
working with the Orthopedic Society to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at using cannabis as a way to curb
and potentially marginally disrupt the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of opioids that are being required
for excruciating surgeries that will cause
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of chronic pain and chronic
arthritis and PTSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I'm very grateful for is I
was in a very privileged position.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working in a very lucrative
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some savings.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends were able to build a wheelchair
ramp for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a family and close-knit friends that
were able to take care of me and I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: naive to that fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people that come out of these
surgeries are nowhere near as privileged
[SPEAKER_02]: as I am and say I hung on by a thread.
[SPEAKER_02]: I barely actually got out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The vast majority of people don't and I
spent some time to be able to volunteer at
[SPEAKER_02]: the Fracture Clinic to try and be able to
empower people and tell them that they
[SPEAKER_02]: actually can do this and to say that these
people are at rock bottom is I think a
[SPEAKER_02]: valid, valid statement because I myself
felt that I was there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that helped me get out of this
is when you're metabolizing a narcotic and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're taking it every single four hours,
at about the three hour mark, you're
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolizing a narcotic and there's less
of it in your system.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, you're also metabolizing
narcotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about seven weeks into it,
so nearly two months, when I started
[SPEAKER_02]: realizing that I was able to tolerate
pain, however, my cravings were getting
[SPEAKER_02]: larger and larger and larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you're weaning off, you're metabolizing
addictive properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, some way, some way, cravings for the
narcotic, one by the being to manage pain
[SPEAKER_02]: and the other to manage the addiction and
I recognized that my addiction was
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to become more pronounced for the
reasons why I couldn't wait for those four
[SPEAKER_02]: hours to be over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a surgical wound that became
infected, so I had a nurse that was
[SPEAKER_02]: visiting me twice a day to dress it and
treat it with silver nitrate, another
[SPEAKER_02]: wonderfully painful experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized that I could actually start
tolerating this pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I realized that it was the addiction
that was taking over and not the pain
[SPEAKER_02]: manager, I quit cold turkey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you gathered, I'm not a large
fella and I dropped 15 pounds in four
[SPEAKER_02]: days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't sleep for four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to say that I don't suffer from
any chronic mental health issues,
[SPEAKER_02]: rather grounded, educated individual and
you completely lose your mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go into a state of complete delirium.
[SPEAKER_02]: The description that I could give is
essentially going completely anemic,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is something that happened to me
from blood loss as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm familiar with that feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hopelessness, essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this wound care specialist was
monitoring me and saw that I was slipping
[SPEAKER_02]: into a dark hole, literally to the point
of brink of death and said, you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: eat, you need to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I can't, I was not physically
capable of even swallowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not hold water down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was no chance of even processing
food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she suggested, she's like, if you're
not eating, you're not sleeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you familiar with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I'm a Dutch guy from
Vancouver, but unfortunately we got drug
[SPEAKER_02]: tested at the investment firm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was naive enough to think that I was
going to be a professional soccer player
[SPEAKER_02]: one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't use cannabis recreationally
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's like, do your friends?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, probably nine out of 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made a phone call and I'm sorry,
Dr. Greenspoon, I know no physician would
[SPEAKER_02]: condone smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to argue that you can't
derive medicinal benefits from smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, but it's clearly not a healthy
way of inducing this medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, that is what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called a friend and he came over with a
bong and some cannabis and I smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And next thing that happened is I slapped
and then I ate and then I smoked again and
[SPEAKER_02]: I slapped and I ate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I repeated that for about five days
and four days of absolute rock bottom hell
[SPEAKER_02]: was offset by six days of blissful
cannabis in reading and video games.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite a nice change in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very good at Skyrim, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I killed a lot of dragons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I came from a position of privilege and
I barely got through this and the opioid
[SPEAKER_02]: epidemic is real, particularly in North
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rampant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started this campaign to be able to
help educate people and be able to help
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing more physicians into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're at a point where we have
orthopedic surgeons that are looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: substituting the narcotics like Dilaudid
with cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So access is starting to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back when I needed to get a prescription
after meeting this nurse practitioner that
[SPEAKER_02]: said you should get cannabis, I had to
literally find a doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wired $450 Canadian to them and it was a
Skype conversation with a doctor from BC.
[SPEAKER_02]: The College of Physicians frowns upon this
extremely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a quote unquote shady deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a real doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a real prescription and I still
hold it to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not access.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would not have known about this if I
did not have a massive infection in my
[SPEAKER_02]: wound and had a nurse that was educated on
cannabis and had seen her own anecdotal
[SPEAKER_02]: evidence that it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is again why I would emphasize
that access is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more that we can educate
physicians and the more that we can talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about stories like this and go beyond
anecdotal evidence that people like Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greenspoon sees in his backyard and
started actually being able to get
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trials, we can make a dramatic
impact on arguably one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: epidemics that we are facing in the
medical world right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now thankfully in Canada we've been
marginally disrupting this by educating
[SPEAKER_02]: more physicians and I think we are at
almost 20% of physicians that are
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they are not comfortable
prescribing it, we have not heard from one
[SPEAKER_02]: that is not comfortable referring a
patient to us to be able to take on that
[SPEAKER_02]: educational component and be that duty of
care for their patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So access was very difficult seven years
ago in Canada and I believe Germany is
[SPEAKER_02]: probably about where we are at about
three, four, five years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can change if you are looking at
people that have experience in this with
[SPEAKER_02]: respect to education.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the materials, they have the
guidance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We learned the hard way by trying to
figure out how patient flow and traffic
[SPEAKER_02]: works and we've discovered a model that
actually works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have seen now with over 1,000
patients and over 30 referring physicians,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think nine prescribing let alone the 19
surgeons that just signed up for this
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trial, that we've made a positive
impact on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the genuine goal from day
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis, I do not want to be
melodramatic and say cannabis saved my
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you were to ask me what the
inflection point was from my recovery,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was quitting opioids and then four days
later using cannabis to curb the symptoms
[SPEAKER_02]: of quitting opioids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I'm able to stand here to
this day and still play competitive soccer
[SPEAKER_02]: and live a life as opposed to being a
synthetic heroin addict.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you cannabis and thank you
Germany.
[SPEAKER_08]: Following Steven is a hard act to follow.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in fact, it's not a smart thing to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't consider myself a smart doctor.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, what do they call the dumbest kid
in your medical school class?
[SPEAKER_08]: Doctor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly, scary.
[SPEAKER_08]: But just some more anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a Dr. Lydia Hatcher, she's the
head of the pain clinic at McMaster
[SPEAKER_08]: University.
[SPEAKER_08]: She has somewhere between 500 and 1,000
patients on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's been able to reduce her opioid use
by 67% and her benzodiazepam by 43%.
[SPEAKER_08]: Further to Dr. Jay-Z's recommendations,
more than half the people that have an
[SPEAKER_08]: accidental or intentional overdose of
opiates are on a combination of an opiate
[SPEAKER_08]: plus a benzodiazepam like Valium,
Lorazepam, Klinazepam.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so important that we get these people
off drugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yet it's my responsibility as a physician
to provide education to the patients when
[SPEAKER_08]: I prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's lots of you out there who know
a lot more about cannabis than I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why I turned to Steven.
[SPEAKER_08]: Steven, I want to prescribe cannabis,
but I need your help to educate the
[SPEAKER_08]: patients and to educate me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what Hello Cannabis has done
for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what Hello Cannabis
International will do for everyone here,
[SPEAKER_08]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to open this one up to the whole
panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just curious to know, how would any of
you approach a physician who is,
[SPEAKER_05]: say, opposed to cannabis to maybe open
their minds?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's several ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, it was just simple conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: With physicians, whenever I am going to
meet them, sort of feel them out and see
[SPEAKER_07]: how they're feeling about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: The next step is to just start throwing as
much anecdotal evidence as humanly
[SPEAKER_07]: possible into the conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Will I have four minutes in front of them?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then from that point, it's hopefully
being able to get another physician like
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Greenspoon to be able and go and have
that conversation and seal the deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And by sharing resources and sharing
physicians, that's how we're going to keep
[SPEAKER_07]: building this community and how we're
going to keep educating.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just really, everybody's been
stressing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This week, and it's been amazing,
it's all about education.
[SPEAKER_07]: The more we talk, the more we stifle
misinformation, and the more we get it out
[SPEAKER_07]: there, we're going to make it a lot easier
for all of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you can talk to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of you are going to open it to the
panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: But talk to us about how Hello Cannabis
has had an impact on accessibility in our
[SPEAKER_05]: area and has impacted patients and
physicians in the medical space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've touched on some of these numbers
in previous discussions that we've had
[SPEAKER_02]: today, but we have seen firsthand the
impact just within three hospitals and
[SPEAKER_02]: five medical centers that we are in.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as we are able to get one
physician to be able to open up and start
[SPEAKER_02]: sending patients to us, typically a
prescription ranges anywhere from three to
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 months, we've kept it at three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way we were able to keep on top of
these patients and be able to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: track how they were doing and what
titration methods they were using and be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to, as Dr. Jayzee said, go low and
slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: When those patients come back,
and I'll let Dr. Greenspoon touch on this,
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say firsthand that we are seeing a
dramatic, dramatic positive impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing a massive reduction in
painkillers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are now seeing patients using this for
insomnia.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was something that I suffered from
back when I was trading on Bay Street.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not be able to sleep and I would
just, you stare at your alarm clock and
[SPEAKER_02]: like, holy crap, it's 3 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to wake up in two hours like this is
nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you still show up and you work and you
literally look like a heroin addict just
[SPEAKER_02]: from insomnia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was prescribed something called
Zopaclone and my family physician said
[SPEAKER_02]: that this is a non-addictive safe
prescription for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be far better for you than
any other sleep aid and I recently found
[SPEAKER_02]: out from new evidence that had come out,
this is going, I was prescribed this 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago, is that you are not supposed to
use this prescription for more than a week
[SPEAKER_02]: and I had a six month supply of it using
it and they wanted me to use this daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we keep talking about
misinformation, these are things that
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis has been able to completely
replace.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother, who's never been intoxicated in
her entire life, who suffers from
[SPEAKER_02]: hypertension and insomnia, now takes a one
to one CBD THC oil and quote unquote she
[SPEAKER_02]: says, I have happy dreams and I've never
slept so well in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now us getting into these medical centers
and meeting one physician and being able
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk either about my own personal story
or to be able to get an in through one of
[SPEAKER_02]: our strategic partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an advisory board with six
physicians that love our story,
[SPEAKER_02]: believe in our story and have seen the
impact it's had on their practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They open up the doors to other physicians
for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately physicians aren't overly
open to talking to businessmen like
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do have to have an introduction from
another physician.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of our ticket in to be
able to start helping access and getting
[SPEAKER_02]: this penetration of physicians to start
looking at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in our own backyard, we have now seen
a dramatic increase in the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: physicians that are prescribing and the
amount of physicians that are sending us
[SPEAKER_02]: patients for referrals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our business has been growing literally
exponentially and we are having a hard
[SPEAKER_02]: time keeping up with the demand of
patients that are trying to either get off
[SPEAKER_02]: of opioids or are looking at natural
health products to replace these synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: products that are, in my opinion,
absolutely decimating our population.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our evidence is unfortunately
anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise you when we are here next year,
we will have clinical trial evidence and
[SPEAKER_02]: we will be able to actually show real
figures as to how many people we have been
[SPEAKER_02]: able to help I promise you that the impact
is massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: We come from a city of 600,000 people and
I can say that we have first-hand already
[SPEAKER_02]: had a material impact there in less than
one year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to reinforce Stephen's statement,
in my old position I did some PR work for
[SPEAKER_05]: some dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: One dispensary model went the way it did
in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_05]: I moved into legal work.
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of my duties there was to manage
their social media and literally dozens
[SPEAKER_05]: and dozens of messages would come in a
week thanking the company in question,
[SPEAKER_05]: MMJ Canada, it was, for allowing access.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was getting them off opioids.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was getting them off junk.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was their term.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was getting them off even alcohol.
[SPEAKER_05]: So education is definitely key to harm
reduction and that's a good look for
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody in cannabis, everybody who is in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something we should all get behind
from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, we are going to come to
the question and answer portion of the
[SPEAKER_05]: panel, I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it again for the panel once
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone have any questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you probably had an edible or two
after lunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should probably know this and I will
look at your website, but can you tell me
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit more about Hello Cannabis,
how you're funded, structured,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I certainly don't mind sharing the
business model behind us.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I was saying before, in order for me to
get a cannabis prescription, I had to pay
[SPEAKER_02]: a wire transfer to a physician literally
across the country and then be connected
[SPEAKER_02]: via a Skype broadcast, which was quite
strange to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: In all of Canada, we have access to
medication and OHIP free of charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that needs to be conducive with
cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the major reasons why we
still have a difficult time with
[SPEAKER_02]: accessibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our services are completely free.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are funded and financed by licensed
producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their business model is, of course,
to be able to help patients and patients
[SPEAKER_02]: purchase cannabis from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we are sourcing specific products that
we believe have the highest efficacy for
[SPEAKER_02]: specific ailments, and this is data that
we are mining as fast and furiously as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible to be able to help physicians
like Dr. Greenspoon find the best product
[SPEAKER_02]: for the specific ailment of each
individual person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe that that's paramount.
[SPEAKER_02]: Licensed producers compensate us for those
referrals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe that I was taking these six
pills every single four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: You metabolize narcotics differently
hourly, daily, and there are so many
[SPEAKER_02]: variables that will change how you
metabolize a narcotic, whether it's sleep,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's how much you've ate.
[SPEAKER_02]: When people, when you're self-medicating
with cannabis, as Dr. Jay-Z touched on
[SPEAKER_02]: this again.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I love saying that name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Jay-Z touched on this as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: To go low and slow, but there are so many
different variables that can affect how
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis will metabolize and how it will
affect you psychoactively.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I think having a company like
Hello Cannabis, to be able to help those
[SPEAKER_02]: people on that journey and be a resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have live chat immediately on our
website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patients have full access to be able to
talk to one of our educators.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are all medical cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all understand self-medication.
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly believe that you will metabolize a
narcotic differently based on stress,
[SPEAKER_02]: sleep, and many, many, many other
variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does require multiple touches.
[SPEAKER_02]: To provide those services, we get
compensated through licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The company was founded and self-funded.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was bootstrapped and grown literally
from the ground up with just a,
[SPEAKER_02]: a few decent contacts, my black book of
contacts, and a cell phone and a couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's grown to Hello Cannabis
International where we're open and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: already started providing some of our
services in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the couch to the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to add something to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: When a patient comes in to see me because
they can't sleep and I decide to prescribe
[SPEAKER_08]: a form of Valium, let's say Lorazepam,
to help them sleep, it's a controlled
[SPEAKER_08]: substance.
[SPEAKER_08]: I talk to them about the risks and the
benefits and then I prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't charge the patient for that
service.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's part of the Ontario Health Insurance
Plan.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a number.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if somebody needs cannabis,
the same argument goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_08]: I discuss the risks and the benefits and
then I prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why should I charge them for cannabis when
I haven't charged them for Valium?
[SPEAKER_08]: So the college frowns upon charging
patients for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of doctors still do and they're
subject to a complaint.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're in trouble.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello Cannabis allows me to, to make the
prescription, send the patient to the
[SPEAKER_08]: educational clinic that does a lot of the
work for me so, so that I don't have to
[SPEAKER_08]: spend the extra time myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also should tell you that I've been a
doctor for 40, more than 40 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I delivered babies for 35 years,
more than 3,500 babies.
[SPEAKER_08]: The nicest patients I've ever met are the
cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're usually a bit older, 55,
60, they need education.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're the nicest patients that I have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And back to the, back to the original
business model and what you guys are
[SPEAKER_07]: saying is that I'll pay $300, go see a
physician.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're forced to buy your
cannabis through one conduit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we've realized is that everybody
symptoms are different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's ailments are different.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in Canada, we're so blessed to have so
much amazing medicine from now,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think as of this week, 93 licensed
producers, that it's actually unethical
[SPEAKER_07]: for us to force somebody down one conduit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why we started searching out
for these different relationships so that
[SPEAKER_07]: we can go and find the absolute best
medicine for our patients and take care of
[SPEAKER_07]: them.
[SPEAKER_07]: If somebody doesn't like the flavor of
their CBD oil, well, we'll move them over
[SPEAKER_07]: to someone like Tilray who's coming out
with capsules.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have that ability and by hitting that
touch point, following up holistically
[SPEAKER_07]: with those patients at three months,
we have the ability to say, how's your
[SPEAKER_07]: titration going?
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you enjoying your medicine?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you finding that it's working for you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like us to switch your
prescription to another licensed producer?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we can do that for you as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And by doing that, we're giving that extra
attention.
[SPEAKER_07]: It comes back to education and those
people are going out and they're having
[SPEAKER_07]: that conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you have 60 year old ladies at
Bridge Club on Friday night talking about
[SPEAKER_07]: what kind of CBD oils they're on and what
their next LP is gonna be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we're seeing happen right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Benjamin Bajak and I
have to thank for this wonderful,
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful things you make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's possible to find doctors and
pharmacists here in Germany that will to
[SPEAKER_00]: make this wonderful thing for the people
in Germany, we will sit together and talk
[SPEAKER_00]: together about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's make wonderful things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have a beer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You changed it to Hello Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll talk a little bit about the
branding as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello Cannabis is clearly pretty in your
face with respect to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what we're about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It truly is a suffix for goodbye opioids
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole concept was goodbye opioids,
hello cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we didn't just want to pigeonhole
ourselves to only being able to help
[SPEAKER_02]: opioid addiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that it does help many,
many, many other ailments.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, Hello Cannabis is here
specifically to be able to help people get
[SPEAKER_02]: off of opioids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're finding many, many,
many other ailments that this wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: product is actually helping with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we look forward to hopefully being
able to help Germany and hopefully be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to educate your physicians to be able to
make sure that you don't fall under the
[SPEAKER_02]: exact same path that North America has
fallen under.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is an opioid absolute epidemic,
which is ravaging our countries right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you said your patients all fill out a
survey.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to have more studies and
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many patients do you have right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Forgive me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER_06]: How many patients do you have right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all filling out surveys and forms.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're about a thousand patients through
the... About a thousand patients.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had gone through beta testing for
about eight months to make sure that we
[SPEAKER_02]: were actually able to... Our business
model had worked and we were able to
[SPEAKER_02]: sustain the growth that I knew was going
to become exponential.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a grand opening at our first clinic
about four months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been about a 24 month project
that over the last year and a half has
[SPEAKER_02]: finally kind of come to fruition.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are now adding between 20 and 40
patients a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had just opened up our telemed services
where we were able to go nationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we had limitations on
advertising, which Ben had started the
[SPEAKER_02]: Goodbye Opioids campaign.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's quite well connected in the music
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're now throwing events almost on a
bi-weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is conducive of Hello Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the word is spreading rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not be surprised if by next month
we are adding 50 patients a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal is 7,500 patients by the end of
the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to smash that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should mention that as a doctor we do
intakes, we do measurable outcomes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually measure their pain level.
[SPEAKER_08]: 75% of the patients are pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's anxiety, post-traumatic stress,
nausea, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: But 75% of the patients are chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have measurable outcomes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We follow them every three months.
[SPEAKER_08]: We make sure they're getting better.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what Hello Cannabis does as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm coming over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be easier if I had a jet pack.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could just float.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone should have a big one for next
year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a teleportation device.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Steven.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just mentioned that you're planning to
go to Europe as well and open some
[SPEAKER_09]: subsidiaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any idea in terms of time when
you're trying to approach Germany?
[SPEAKER_09]: Last week.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already been approached by four
countries so far even just at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this event, I do believe that we have
the supply, the business model,
[SPEAKER_02]: and sustainability to be able to actually
bring physicians out and be able to have
[SPEAKER_02]: speakers, to be able to get them out at
conventions, to be able to get them to
[SPEAKER_02]: start speaking one on one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that would probably slow us
down is the language barrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, we are monolinguous,
not polyglots like most of Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rather embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do have physicians that I think are
extremely reputable, charismatic,
[SPEAKER_02]: and will be able to speak at a very high
level to other physicians to educate them
[SPEAKER_02]: in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like Lithuania, Denmark,
and Germany are going to be our first
[SPEAKER_02]: stops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think anyone has any more
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys want to make a few closing
remarks?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure I can speak on behalf of the
whole panel, but I would just like to
[SPEAKER_05]: thank ICBC for having us all out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really important that we all get
together and build our community and share
[SPEAKER_05]: information.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like you to put your hands
together for this group right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Alex.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Give it up, you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Canadian physicians, this is a big thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of analogy in German.
[SPEAKER_09]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, you guys, so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
