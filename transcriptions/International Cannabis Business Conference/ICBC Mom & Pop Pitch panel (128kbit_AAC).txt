[SPEAKER_10]: This is the International Cannabis
Business Conference right here,
[SPEAKER_10]: Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's make some noise.
[SPEAKER_10]: This next panel is really more of an
event, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the mom and pop pitch competition.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the dank tank.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: Dank tank.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dank tank.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like shark tank, but with dank.
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of you are like, is that like sensory
deprivation?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, this is the dank tank.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have four different companies.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to come up, they're going to
pitch their idea, and then we have a panel
[SPEAKER_10]: of judges.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to decide who wins,
and the winner gets $10,000 check and a
[SPEAKER_10]: bunch of other considerations.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, how's that sound?
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that sound exciting?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to introduce the judges first
over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have with us the co-founder of Hi-Fi
Farms and the co-host of the This is
[SPEAKER_10]: Cannabis radio show on X-Ray FM.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's hear it for Lee Henderson.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our next judge is a freelance cannabis
writer.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's written for Broccoli Magazine,
for the Willamette Weekly, and for Rolling
[SPEAKER_10]: Stone.
[SPEAKER_10]: She's here right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's hear it for Lauren Yoshiko Terry.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the way at the end over there,
the cutest man in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at him.
[SPEAKER_10]: The founder, the founder and producer of
the world famous and worldwide
[SPEAKER_10]: international cannabis business
conferences.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Alex Rogers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Final judge.
[SPEAKER_10]: All-star forward for the Portland
Trailblazers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cannabis freedom fighter and a legend
worldwide, Cliff Robinson.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is how it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Each contestant will have six minutes to
give their pitch, and then there's six
[SPEAKER_10]: minutes for the judges to ask questions,
and then at the end, the judges are all
[SPEAKER_10]: going to huddle up and we're going to
decide a winner.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty simple, pretty
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_10]: Judges, are you ready?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Crowd, are you ready?
[SPEAKER_11]: Good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Contestants, are you ready?
[SPEAKER_10]: Coming to the stage, our first group
tonight.
[SPEAKER_10]: Their slogan is connoisseur cannabis from
where the forest meets the sea.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Andrew Matthews with Coastal
Cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Andrew Matthews.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the founder and co-owner of Coastal
Cannabinoids, a medical and recreational
[SPEAKER_09]: dispensary along the Oregon coast in
Walport, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_09]: We started with the Oregon Health
Authority back in 2014, March 3rd,
[SPEAKER_09]: when we did the rollout.
[SPEAKER_09]: We remained medical and did the temporary
rec sales starting in October 2015,
[SPEAKER_09]: and ran into some licensing issues in
2016, and we're just awarded our rec
[SPEAKER_09]: license April 3rd of this month,
or this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are currently OCC licensed with a
medical endorsement.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the largest OMP customer base in
Lincoln County.
[SPEAKER_09]: We specialize in a lot of local products.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a handful of farms within 45
minutes that we offer a lot of their
[SPEAKER_09]: products.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do a lot of for-cost monthly
medications for patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're in a small community, about 2,200
people, a lot of retirement folks that are
[SPEAKER_09]: on fixed incomes.
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the day, they just can't
afford it, so we do as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of that's at our cost.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've always been medical at heart.
[SPEAKER_09]: We started medical.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's where my heart is.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love helping patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, we had to go recreational
to meet the financial needs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so 75% of our workforce is made up
of owners.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's me and actually my neighbors,
a husband and wife couple.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one employee that we were finally
able to bring back about June.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one employee made up of us four.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and each owner.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've all been OMP growers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did a lot of work with patients before
organ health authority got involved and
[SPEAKER_09]: brought it to the level that they did in
2014.
[SPEAKER_09]: We both still have current OMP grows.
[SPEAKER_09]: With so the money, I wanted to do a
information station for patients and
[SPEAKER_09]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_09]: The need to get good information out
there, the correct information.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so many misconceptions,
especially with hemp-based products,
[SPEAKER_09]: CBD hitting the market.
[SPEAKER_09]: So many people are mail ordering things.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've seen on the evening news or
they've read about it online and they come
[SPEAKER_09]: to us and say, I bought this off of Amazon
and this didn't work or this doesn't meet
[SPEAKER_09]: my expectations and where are we at with
this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or there are constant rule changes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just good information in general to be
able to offer a station that has stuff
[SPEAKER_09]: that people could take with them.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do some information classes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just about to do a CBD class in our
community.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just educating some people that may not be
comfortable with the dispensary
[SPEAKER_09]: atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'd rather go to a town hall meeting
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also gonna do it online and do a
PowerPoint presentation so people that are
[SPEAKER_09]: not comfortable with showing up to the
town hall meeting either still have
[SPEAKER_09]: availability to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We work with a local OMP doctor or a
doctor that does OMP recommendations and
[SPEAKER_09]: offer our shop to do those in.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so the in-house pre-roll
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_09]: We work with a lot of farms, mom and pop
farms that do not have the capital to
[SPEAKER_09]: purchase some of these nicer pre-roll
machines.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've got our eyes set on a future roll
in the lock box capable of rolling out
[SPEAKER_09]: high volume joints in a matter of minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's allowed us to take some of the
flour grown from some of these farms that
[SPEAKER_09]: don't offer it in pre-rolls and give those
to patients at a cost that's affordable to
[SPEAKER_09]: them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So many farms want to arm and a leg for
their pre-roll products but we can
[SPEAKER_09]: purchase the flour cheaper and manufacture
the pre-rolls ourselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking forward towards the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna continue to work and grow with
our rural community.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, we do the CBD class.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm involved with all the city council
meetings and county commission meetings.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've always been, I guess, the voice of
our community.
[SPEAKER_09]: Being the first dispensary in the area,
I guess I've kind of been the go-to for
[SPEAKER_09]: any of the local commentary and stuff for
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, yeah, we continue to provide
cannabis education and classes around the
[SPEAKER_09]: coastal communities.
[SPEAKER_09]: A little bit harder to get over to the
valley and the valley's got a pretty good
[SPEAKER_09]: representation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately,
 on the coast, we're
limited to the resources that we have
[SPEAKER_09]: available out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a picture of the shop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I thank you guys for your
consideration.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's here for Andrew Matthews from Coastal
Cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we, the judges have six minutes to
ask questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a quick question.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you think rec has, the rec thing is
gonna change you?
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you think that's gonna affect you,
if you will?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, hopefully for the better,
but in what other?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, we've, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've seen an increase in volume.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had a handful of record-breaking
days since we've been rec.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you're based on a dollar
evaluation, that's hard to do compared to
[SPEAKER_09]: two years, a year and a half ago when
prices were two, three, four times what
[SPEAKER_09]: they are today.
[SPEAKER_09]: So seeing that, us meet our financial
goals and they're showing that we got the
[SPEAKER_09]: volume with the prices being lower.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, no, it's been a good experience,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lauren, is your microphone working?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it isn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was gonna ask the information station,
how are consumers gonna be accessing that
[SPEAKER_06]: in theory?
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so we've got a wall as you come
in and as you're leaving that we've got
[SPEAKER_09]: designated.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got about a, oh god, I don't know,
about a 25, 30 square foot area to where
[SPEAKER_09]: we wanna put plastic slots for brochures
and flyers and whatnot and be able to
[SPEAKER_09]: print some of that material ourselves as
well as order from some of the vendors
[SPEAKER_09]: that we work with or some of the companies
that we deal with.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many farms do you work with,
like your vendors?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how local are they to you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they more inland?
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so no, we work with, we work with
a lot of farms.
[SPEAKER_09]: I work real closely with Geek Farms out of
Otis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've known Mike for a number of years and
got a good working relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I work out with a couple of smaller farms
out of the Tillamook area.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a couple grows in the Lincoln
County area.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, no, we do.
[SPEAKER_09]: We get a lot of supply from southern
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_09]: We deal with Doghouse and a couple other
guys in the valley.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so what we try to do is pick the
top two or three varieties or products
[SPEAKER_09]: from each vendor and then be able to offer
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we kinda hand pick things.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many other shops are in your area?
[SPEAKER_05]: Within like five miles or so?
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so there's two other ones
actively right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a third one to make four of us
total that's had a license now for going
[SPEAKER_09]: on about eight months.
[SPEAKER_09]: Seen no activity down there.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got signs up on the windows and
stuff, but no action.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not really sure what's going on
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, we've got two other shops in our
area.
[SPEAKER_05]: What were the licensing issues you ran
into that you mentioned?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think we just, we hit it at a
bad time.
[SPEAKER_09]: About a third of the way into it,
we went through and my original partner
[SPEAKER_09]: sold his, his majority, which opened the
can of worms to everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Along with OCC taking on some new
investigators.
[SPEAKER_09]: We happened to get one that was fresh out
of training and we were her first case.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we had to jump through quite a few
hoops to get it going.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know how that goes.
[SPEAKER_11]: With the market being oversaturated the
way it is, how do you plan to separate
[SPEAKER_11]: yourself from the other?
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, we've got a pretty interesting
business model.
[SPEAKER_09]: Try to kill in volume.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have $50 ounces to where we move a lot
of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: We price things accordingly to what we
take them in at.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I get a good deal, we pass that
right on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's how we're able to do some of
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody's making money if that stuff's
sitting on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the farm's not getting paid.
[SPEAKER_09]: The vendor's not getting paid.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not getting paid.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, you just move it at a,
at a price to where, to where it'll move.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, everybody's happy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it just takes a little bit of
business to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask you again about the information
station?
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as being kind of aggressive or
proactive about taking that information to
[SPEAKER_05]: the community rather than waiting for the
community to come to you, if that makes
sense?
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you guys talked about that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said earlier, that we do have
patients and consumers that just are not
[SPEAKER_09]: comfortable with coming through the door.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're right on 101.
[SPEAKER_09]: Small town of 2,200 people.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, everybody knows everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody knows what everybody drives.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so it, it is nice because being
in, in a coastal community, you've got a,
[SPEAKER_09]: a big tourism push during the summer
months.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for those people, it's nice that they
can grab it on their way out the door.
[SPEAKER_09]: For our local communities, that,
that's where we've looked at doing the
[SPEAKER_09]: classes and stuff like that and offering
that information and having that available
[SPEAKER_09]: for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you say, you said you source a lot of
local products?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: What does that, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, because for me, like,
it all has to come from Oregon and that's
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty local.
[SPEAKER_08]: But do you mean like farms close to your
dispensaries specifically or?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we work with, yeah, we work with a
couple processors and a couple farms that
[SPEAKER_09]: are within 20 minutes, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: So there, there's something to be said.
[SPEAKER_09]: When a customer comes in and they say,
you know, they look on the shelf and they
[SPEAKER_09]: say, well, what's organically grown or,
or what's this?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_09]: And to be able to tell a personal story.
[SPEAKER_09]: Say, yeah, I've known Mike at Geek Farms
for two or three years.
[SPEAKER_09]: I go to his farm and, you know,
he's got an aloe garden, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: where he uses for his base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's got all in-house earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just, it's nice to be able to have that
personal connection.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of the farms in, you know,
Eastern Oregon or Southern Oregon are just
[SPEAKER_09]: out of my reach.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm unable to get down there as often.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's nice to work with somebody that's
a little close.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think there's an opportunity to
sort of band together and, and really,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, try to leverage y'all's regional
thing together more as a group,
[SPEAKER_05]: as far as, again, talking, you know,
talking to the community?
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, so I've got a, I've got a union
background.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a longshoreman for six years and
then I worked in the operating engineers
[SPEAKER_09]: as a crane, as a crane operator.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've got a unionization background.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've seen that for a long time,
watching the bottom fall out of this
[SPEAKER_09]: industry after being in it for so long and
lobbying, trying to bring it to light,
[SPEAKER_09]: has been disheartening, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: So some type of banding together,
some type of unionization, and get some of
[SPEAKER_09]: these, these issues conquered and put to
bed and move on with this stuff,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're out of time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's hear it again for Andrew Matthews
and Coastal Kanabinoid.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Contestant number two, all the way from
Yamhill and Washington counties,
[SPEAKER_10]: representing the Western Oregon
Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's hear it for Sherry Ralston.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, I'm Sherry Ralston from Western
Oregon Dispensary, Western Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: Metanical and CBD Medicine for Life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we bought property for three
dispensaries and we opened Newberg in 2015
[SPEAKER_00]: medically and went rec in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherwood, we opened medically in 2016 and
we are still a medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the only one, I believe,
in the Portland metropolitan market right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're still waiting on our city
mill location.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one has been forthcoming for three
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had a lot of challenges,
issues with banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them we've been kicked out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, you have a good cry,
and after that it's like a flee in the
[SPEAKER_00]: scheme of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And issues with the city's getting open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Newberg tried to force us to pay a 10%
city tax, which we, we were able to work
[SPEAKER_00]: through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherwood has probably really been the butt
kicker for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put two campaigns together to go
recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one was really organized and
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even had some city council members
endorse us and we still lost with the
[SPEAKER_00]: second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we're staying medical at the
Sherwood Dispensary and it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to stay that way for quite a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cedar Mills store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, like I said, three years in the
making, we've been picketed, we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: banned, we've had our application appealed
by the county, and we've actually had some
[SPEAKER_00]: competition try and steal our license.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one, though, is actually in the queue
and we're hoping we'll get open by the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we did do after we
lost the campaign in Sherwood,
[SPEAKER_00]: we transferred one of our billboards to a
new design where we offered the people in
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherwood that had voted for recreational
dispensary a 10% discount just to drive to
[SPEAKER_00]: our closest store and we had a good
response from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other issues that we had was
Washington County changed some rules on us
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have a turnkey cannabis kitchen in
the same building as our third dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: and we thought we'd be doing some
medibles, but they changed some rules on
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're back fighting that so that we can
get that zoning corrected so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: open that up as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our grow site, we've had your normal
challenges with transformers blowing and
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption rates going overboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, my husband last
winter was diagnosed with multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: myeloma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while all that was going on,
we did some chemo and a stem cell
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do for our medical customer,
because we are strictly medical at
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherwood and our recreational store down
the road does support that as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we give out free product with every
purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The staff is slow, so they'd roll
hand-rolled 1.3-gram pre-rolls that are
[SPEAKER_00]: given out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really started to focus on the veterans
because that's kind of the voice in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that a lot of our customers
just weren't able to find the high grade
[SPEAKER_00]: products that they used to be able to buy
before the rec market came into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took a position on these magic
butter machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also give them free product with
that when they purchase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we let them purchase it at a discount
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we teach them how to make their own
high grade edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sell a lot of those machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our medical customers love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We offer half pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sell half pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half pounds of weed at just above our
cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the customers like that too,
because again, they can make their own
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spend up to 30 minutes with our
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know everybody's name on a first name
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have just 10% discounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a VIP card.
[SPEAKER_00]: We send out these little gold cards that
makes them feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just really generate some
enthusiastic some enthusiasm with our
[SPEAKER_00]: medical customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is there's very few
medical processors in the market right now
[SPEAKER_00]: for us to buy one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Pharmix is one of those out there
that's a really neat company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we partnered with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we give them free flour and trim
because they can't afford to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they make us products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make us a sublingual drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a PhD compounding pharmacist
that comes in and helps consult with some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the patients on some of the things that
they might be looking for to handle their
[SPEAKER_00]: particular issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also developed a soft lozenge that he
made for his mom who has Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's coming to us shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just finally were able to
master making gummies and capsules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have a few more products
to be able to sell in that store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been a real challenge for us
because a lot of our shelves are just
[SPEAKER_00]: basically empty because we cannot buy from
a recreational processor the medical grade
[SPEAKER_00]: goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to do it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to find somebody to do it for
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pharmix has been great with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have reached out to Weed of Warriors
and we've developed a program where we
[SPEAKER_00]: give them a bag of dirt, a couple of smart
pots and two clones and some nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: a brief summation on how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's working really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to grow their own products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a vet named Scott, he did a video
for us to go with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate to cut you off, but you are over
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's hear it for Sheri Ralston from the
Western Oregon Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now questions from the judges.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure some of these things you might
have gotten to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we'll open it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But is it a choice that you hadn't gone
recreational or is it because of zoning?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you able to even apply in those areas?
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Sherwood decided that they
didn't want a recreational store there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they banned us off the bat and then we
did a campaign and we lost that by 55%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we said screw it, we came back a
second year, did a big campaign and we
[SPEAKER_00]: lost it by 57%.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the existing two locations are medical
only as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: One is recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Newberg store is recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our medical store in Newberg is
straight medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just kind of, you can touch on it,
but what did you have specific,
[SPEAKER_06]: would this award end up going towards your
efforts in Sherwood or what would you use
[SPEAKER_06]: this for really?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it would go directly to the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to buy more products so that we
can make things for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also found that because our medical
store is not able to carry hemp CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: products and our rec store cannot source
the high percentage CBD products,
[SPEAKER_00]: we opened a tiny little store about a
month ago that's just straight CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp CBD, and we're sourcing high
percentage CBD products for those
[SPEAKER_00]: customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the money will go to help me
with that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a big need for high grade
CBD products and there isn't any in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market in the state of Oregon and I can't
buy any of those or carry any of those in
[SPEAKER_00]: my medical store.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you gonna keep that medical store
open?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That store's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like there's so many challenges
with being a medical company these days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you guys considered kind of
partnering with, even further,
[SPEAKER_05]: collectivizing with some of the medical
growers and maybe the Pharmax to sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: pool your efforts?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are really doing that actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that when the metric started to
come into play for the medical growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of them didn't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're small time people, but they have
these really beautiful boutique quality
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we brought them in and we sat them down
and we showed them how to do metric and we
[SPEAKER_00]: told them, we will support you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will buy your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even help you pay for the testing
because we need to continue to source the
[SPEAKER_00]: high grade flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really our market right now and we
want to support those medical growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a small medical grow ourselves
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you say your competition tried to
steal your license, what do you exactly
[SPEAKER_08]: mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not gonna name names,
but when we were working on getting our
[SPEAKER_00]: license, that particular store has nobody
around it and there's no other locations
[SPEAKER_00]: around there that a store can be put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a desirable location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, there was a frenzy of
activity of people that wanted to get
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries and there was a lot of
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we turned these people down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, no, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were not interested in selling that
location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had some sneaky ways of trying to
take that license from us occur,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we were able to work through,
but it was just another challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just another kind of clog in the
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just another kind of drain on the
west side of town to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard in Washington and Yamho Canyon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which dispensary was that for,
your medical or your?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a recreational license.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was your rec one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's out there trying to steal medical
licenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really quick, are you, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was my question.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're the only medical dispensary
in the Portland area, the metro area is
[SPEAKER_08]: what you said?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems that that might be a viable
economic model because you are the only
[SPEAKER_08]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we do service over a thousand
patients in different counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that the main problem is I can't
source product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a source and I can't buy from
a recreational processor that's making
[SPEAKER_00]: medical grade goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're forced to go to a recreational
store for some of their needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other problem is it's.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if OLCC processors and growers could
sell to you directly, your problem would
[SPEAKER_08]: be solved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would solve a lot of our problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be able to carry all the products
that a recreational store carries,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we can't do that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't carry any hemp products
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're operating with our arm behind our
back right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really just forced us to focus on
the veterans and the medical community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get calls from all over the nation
right now from other states that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: starting medical programs talking to us
about how we operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This program that we use is called Green
Nurse Group, where they flew out from the
[SPEAKER_00]: East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they help with pain management with
medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came out and they did a video on
how we interact with the budget blood
[SPEAKER_00]: tenders and the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a lot of that stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps us busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is rewarding even though financially
the store is not that not profitable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask the opportunity?
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to me that there might be an
interesting business opportunity working
[SPEAKER_05]: with, again, like grow for vets or the
weed for warriors in terms of partnering
[SPEAKER_05]: with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even further to really kind of go push the
message.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're effectively running a nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like you're doing altruistic
God's work.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can partner with someone to help
you get that message out and maybe share
[SPEAKER_05]: it with their resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you consider that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Veterans Association won't acknowledge
cannabis for veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they won't give us any way to
advertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they won't give us any way to contact
the veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to get a hold of these
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let them know what we're doing and
what we have for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another challenge.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, thank you very, very much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good answers and good questions.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: One more time, Sherry Ralston.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sherry Ralston from Western Oregon
Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, group number three, Numero Tres.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been married nine years.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been directly serving the cannabis
community for nearly a decade.
[SPEAKER_10]: From the greener side, let's hear it for
Jo and Chelsea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2010, before dispensaries were legal,
they were patient resource centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jo and I opened our first resource
center in 2010, the greenery serving
[SPEAKER_01]: veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical patients in Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2013, we moved to Eugene, where we
opened the greener side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a great success until four
months in, local police raided our store.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a really critical moment for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lost everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we faced the possibility of losing our
children and our freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a choice to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we decided we were in it for the long
haul and we were gonna keep going.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, we kept on going.
[SPEAKER_07]: The very next day, we opened our doors and
continued to serve the patients that
[SPEAKER_07]: needed access the most.
[SPEAKER_07]: These were people that had absolutely no
access, didn't know anybody, didn't know
[SPEAKER_07]: anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Through supporting the medical community,
we opened up our doors in 2014 with one of
[SPEAKER_07]: the first medical marijuana facility
licenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then through all the ever-changing
rules and every four months of the,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, rules changing and everything of
that nature for the OLCC, we were granted
[SPEAKER_07]: our first OLCC license and then expanded
our brand in 2017 out into Detroit Lake.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, since 2010, we've seen a very large
shift in not only the cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_07]: but the cannabis industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_07]: The graph you see here is persons per
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Eugene, you can see, has the lowest
number there, or the lowest chart there,
[SPEAKER_07]: showing us that we have the biggest,
the most saturated market that we're
[SPEAKER_07]: dealing with in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, how do we continue to be the best in a
saturated market and how do we keep
[SPEAKER_01]: growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we found that it's more than having
the right product at the right time for
[SPEAKER_01]: profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're known for being knowledgeable and
active in our industry, helping the people
[SPEAKER_01]: who need it the most, and using our brand
to leverage the cannabis movement's
[SPEAKER_01]: message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since we only have six minutes,
we'll show you a few examples in a few
[SPEAKER_01]: different areas of how we do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Oregon Cannabis Classic came to
fruition because of our raid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, after police took everything from us,
we had to think of legal ways to get some
[SPEAKER_01]: funds so we could continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it turned out we didn't actually need
to do that because the community wanted us
[SPEAKER_01]: there so bad that they used their own time
and money to help us become an even bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we wanted to take the opportunity to
collaborate with our industry and give
[SPEAKER_01]: back to people who could use our help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's been a smashing success,
and for the last four years, we've donated
[SPEAKER_01]: over $15,000 to the Multiple Sclerosis
Society of Portland with our industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, being in the industry for so long,
there is a movement in an industry,
[SPEAKER_07]: and normalizing our industry is very
important to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple steps that I've taken is join the
Rotary.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, my sponsor Mike's here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, it wasn't always easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got denied at first, but we didn't give
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took six months.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually got accepted as the first
cannabis business owner to be accepted
[SPEAKER_07]: into the Rotary Club in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we took that, and during our lobby
days in D.C., I actually went to a
[SPEAKER_07]: luncheon and was able to give all the
credentials that we were taking to the
[SPEAKER_07]: senators and the legislators, and I gave
that to the president-elect of the United
[SPEAKER_07]: Nations to the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, just trying to push our movement
forward as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that same time, we lobbied in D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: with the Cannabis Industry Lobby Days
through NCIA, and for several years,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have lobbied on a federal level,
because being a part of the national
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation is just as important as being
part of the local conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are just a few of the organizations
we've been a part of.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you definitely have to get
involved at your local and local state
[SPEAKER_07]: level and federal level, and these are
definitely a lot of them that has helped
[SPEAKER_07]: us through our travels there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and great things happen when you
work with great people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, through our advertisements,
we have over here in the blue chip,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is in our Register Guard financial
section, and then we have an example of
[SPEAKER_01]: our ad from the Eugene Magazine,
which can be found at doctors' offices in
[SPEAKER_01]: Lane County.
[SPEAKER_01]: The subscribers are 40 years or older.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep our advertisement light and funny,
and we're reaching out to an audience who
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to get educated from someone who has
really good information, like the greener
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, once we've influenced them,
the senior community, the older folks,
[SPEAKER_01]: we positively engage with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most recently, we had a successful event
at the Campbell Community Center in July,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we presented Curious About Cannabis
Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was to a group of 30 seniors,
and what we found was they're
[SPEAKER_01]: uncomfortable walking into a dispensary,
or it's a hardship for them to get there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they had so many questions that it
could last an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when presented with this opportunity
to have $10,000, we wanted to do something
[SPEAKER_01]: that would increase our sales and
positively impact our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to build on our senior outreach,
and with 30% we'll upgrade our outreach
[SPEAKER_01]: materials, 20% would go to targeted ads so
that those people would know that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: the resources for them, 50% we would use
for a delivery vehicle with insurance so
[SPEAKER_01]: we can get the product to them if they
need it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening to our stories.
[SPEAKER_10]: Joan Chelsea from the greener side.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now to the questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the greener side is still located in
Eugene?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we have a location in Eugene and
Detroit Lake, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And is delivery, has that been passed by
the City of Eugene and all that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's passed in Eugene and we do have
the qualifications to do so under LCC.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you find the oversaturated market
in Eugene given that there aren't any
[SPEAKER_05]: boundaries?
[SPEAKER_05]: Aren't there a lot of boundaries?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the boundary, the buffer zone
actually recently just did get enacted in
[SPEAKER_07]: Eugene.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, daylight dollar short.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Eugene.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is interesting being one of the first
dispensary in town and then just being a
[SPEAKER_07]: drop in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_07]: It really makes us focus on the best
customer service and the highest quality
[SPEAKER_07]: product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Essentially, every single person that
comes in our door, their experience
[SPEAKER_07]: doesn't end at the right time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It ends at the register sale.
[SPEAKER_07]: It ends when that experience travels all
the way through there until they're done
[SPEAKER_07]: using that product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to commend you guys for all your
community-focused efforts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you guys say you had dispensary in
southern Oregon and Eugene, but that was
[SPEAKER_08]: before the dispensary initiative.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it sounds like you guys were pioneers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, you faced some real troubles,
which I know something about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Explain that experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: What made you decide to do that and what I
would consider to take that chance?
[SPEAKER_08]: And do you think that by doing that,
can you say now, do you think that that
[SPEAKER_08]: gave you a competitive advantage?
[SPEAKER_08]: In any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what encouraged us to take that step
was seeing businesses open up in an
[SPEAKER_01]: unregulated market and not putting on the
right face, not having the right business
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew we could come in and show our
communities that having a dispensary would
[SPEAKER_01]: not do all the negative things they
thought it would.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would actually be a benefit to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we did that really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it definitely gave us an
advantage because we grew up with the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We were part of the traditional market,
and now we're part of the OLCC market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to be a part of that
growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think sometimes it's hard for me to
think of myself as a pioneer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it just felt like the right thing
to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was definitely scary putting
our children on the line.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, when I was in high
school, going to my friend's house to pick
[SPEAKER_07]: up a bag, I always knew that she wasn't a
bad person from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was always a social justice issue for
us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now it's a blessing to be able to play
in the playing field that we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might not be exactly the rules that we
want.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we don't, like Chelsea's starting
to say now, if we don't raise the bar and
[SPEAKER_07]: raise our voice, we're not going to be
able to write our story the way we run it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you guys have a website?
[SPEAKER_11]: A website?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's on the last page right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: KeepEugeneGreen.org.
[SPEAKER_06]: And is the buffer changes that you just
mentioned in Eugene, are those going to
[SPEAKER_06]: cut down on competition for shops,
in theory?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, in theory, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the buffer zone is enacted.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they still have to honor all of the
licenses that have gotten in before the
[SPEAKER_07]: buffer zone happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is in place now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we pretty much just have to ride the
waves until people get shaken out.
[SPEAKER_11]: On that website, are you guys sharing
information to educating folks?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely, that's always been one of our
dedications to the industry, trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: provide that proper information.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nowadays, it's not all about that THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about the plethora of cannabinoids
and terpenes provided, as well as there's
[SPEAKER_07]: always multiple ways of consumption.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another, we touched on it briefly,
the Campbell House.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of our next project,
is to reach out to the old folks home and
[SPEAKER_07]: bring that cannabis 101 class to them
because it is difficult for them to leave
[SPEAKER_07]: their homes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we can inform them about all of
the different products that we have and
[SPEAKER_07]: all of the different things that may
possibly improve their life.
[SPEAKER_08]: What made you open a place?
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you say Detroit Lake?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know what that is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Detroit Lake is on a main thoroughfare
from Bend to Salem and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little slower in the wintertime,
but in the summertime, it's Western
[SPEAKER_07]: Oregon's largest outdoor recreational
area.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of where we're placed on the road,
we're the only dispensary that can be in
[SPEAKER_07]: that town.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Short and sweet, one more time,
Joe and Chelsea from the greener side.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our final contestant of the afternoon is
here to take us on a visit to the land of
[SPEAKER_10]: protanicals.
[SPEAKER_10]: From the Mooroo Company, let's hear it for
Dr. Sheena Vanderplug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this thing on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as Mooroo, we started getting
established in 2013.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were officially licensed on the rec
market in 2017, but we are dual licensed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as working with medically minded
products, I am here to introduce
[SPEAKER_04]: protanicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: The foundation of Mooroo is built on an
ethical and holistic business model that
[SPEAKER_04]: is cooperative in sharing cost and profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something really unique about the
operation is that it does have a shared
[SPEAKER_04]: use kitchen that has fostered the maturity
of 15 different Oregon owned companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are cooperative district
distribution services also.
[SPEAKER_04]: The short of it, especially I think of the
most pivotal nature is this hope for
[SPEAKER_04]: humanity, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are we doing what we're doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's to assist in how we're redefining
healthcare and wellness in society,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially in a society that is so
challenged by epidemics like substance
[SPEAKER_04]: abuse and dependence disorders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anxiety, PTSD, stress and chronic dis-ease
states, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Stress, inflammation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we believe that because so many people
experience a benefit with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is something worth pursuing,
developing and educating and getting out
[SPEAKER_04]: there in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Protanicals by Mooroo is here to offer
an alternative and an adjunctive therapy
[SPEAKER_04]: for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, approaches instead of or with
pharmaceutical agents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to generate products that are
standardized in potency and reliable for
[SPEAKER_04]: the user.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just using cannabis, but other
botanical medicines that have been used
[SPEAKER_04]: for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our team.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spearheading the Protanicals line is
myself and in my seven years of clinical
[SPEAKER_04]: practice, five of those years has been
focused on endocannabinoid therapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am an integrative researcher and I've
been focused on the product development
[SPEAKER_04]: aspect of Protanicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also we have Dr. Glenn Nagel, also a
licensed physician, longtime history
[SPEAKER_04]: formulator and a professor of botanical
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's driving us?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is this all about?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a passionate interest in pursuit and
it comes down to that nature inspires our
[SPEAKER_04]: health, mentally, emotionally,
physically and spiritually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are creating plant-based products
that offer an improved experience for the
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a dream of empowering people with
effective plant-based products to relieve
[SPEAKER_04]: unwanted systems and support their optimal
health.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're promising?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're promising a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with consistent research, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Evidence-based formulation and then
ecologically conscious sourcing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not just eco-friendly, but also
ethical, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pursuing the highest quality ingredients
locally and afar because not all things
[SPEAKER_04]: grow here in Oregon that we are including
in our products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And something reliable for people and
since everyone is different, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're gonna do our best to make sure we
can uphold that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's why it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the research coming out as fast as
it is and the questions emerging in
[SPEAKER_04]: healthcare as quick as they are,
we're realizing that this system that we
[SPEAKER_04]: all have, this endocannabinoid system,
is connected to every other body system in
[SPEAKER_04]: the body.
[SPEAKER_04]: And going to medical school and never
hearing about this was pretty alarming
[SPEAKER_04]: considering now we know that this is
involved in every aspect of our
[SPEAKER_04]: experience, in our minds, in our bodies,
in our life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we've been doing is putting
together the first four products that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to be releasing here in the
Oregon market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are a variety of standardized
potency variable ratios.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are unique in that they are
combining other botanicals to direct the
[SPEAKER_04]: effects of the cannabinoids on certain
body systems so that it can be more useful
[SPEAKER_04]: in treating certain disease states or
relieving symptoms.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the breakdown of what we would do if we
were awarded funds, 30% would be estimated
[SPEAKER_04]: to go towards production costs as you
know, consumer safety regulations,
[SPEAKER_04]: state compliance, hopefully raising the
bar and exceeding the state regulation
[SPEAKER_04]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: 40% to education.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is because I truly believe that
cannabis works best when you are educated
[SPEAKER_04]: and informed.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would not only go for the community
and users but also staff at dispensaries
[SPEAKER_04]: and then professionals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every aspect of our health is influenced
by the endocannabinoid system and this is
[SPEAKER_04]: something that we're just starting to
appreciate as healthcare providers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a tremendous amount of
education that needs to be provided to
[SPEAKER_04]: these professionals that are influencing
all these other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the research as it will continue
and it's really exciting that it's now
[SPEAKER_04]: happening to continue to develop products
that are targeting specific issues as well
[SPEAKER_04]: as enhancing the synergy that exists
between cannabis and other botanicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we continue, we will expand our
education materials and programs and have
[SPEAKER_04]: two sets.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have modules directed at
professionals and then consumers as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would also like to add that I would
really love to be applying for grants and
[SPEAKER_04]: working towards clinical trials for our
products to really raise the bar again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're out of time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_10]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Sina Vander Ploeg.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now the questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell me a little bit more about
the distribution strategy part of the
[SPEAKER_05]: presentation?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Muru has a collective and what that
means is all the shared use kitchen
[SPEAKER_04]: companies that are working in there can
use Muru as their distribution network.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's how that works.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that Muru has CBD only products
that are available outside of
[SPEAKER_06]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is Muru products are only right now
available from licensed dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now it's only licensed dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this would be another product in that
same vein?
[SPEAKER_04]: For now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as I had mentioned, we have dual
licensure for medical and recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been working on getting the
recreational side moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we know, that's super abundant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now with Protanicals, I'd like to see
that available on both sides.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your thoughts on the CBD only
products that are able to be at Whole
[SPEAKER_06]: Foods or whatever?
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lie to Ashina.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would definitely not be concerned about
consuming industrial hemp products as
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the science is pointing to,
we understand that we've appreciated over
[SPEAKER_04]: 60 active cannabinoids in cannabis alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not even including the secondary
and tertiary.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's over 545, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So by isolating CBD from one thing,
I'm kind of just like, you're not offering
[SPEAKER_04]: the whole cannabis matrix and milieu to
interact with our body systems that are so
[SPEAKER_04]: much more sensitive than we give them
credit for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just think with the entourage effect
and everything that Dr. Russo has been
[SPEAKER_04]: coming to light, I mean, we know that the
power is in pulling together a
[SPEAKER_04]: well-coordinated product and a full plant
extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I ask, this $10,000 prize,
will this just be the beginning of your
[SPEAKER_05]: fundraising efforts?
[SPEAKER_05]: Presumably you'll be fundraising more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been exhausting.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the familial and friend loaning
bit and using my private practice to fund
[SPEAKER_04]: things as best I could.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the whole thing is cooperative
partnership.
[SPEAKER_04]: The co-founders initially that were
starting this in 2013 were friends of
[SPEAKER_04]: mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've known them for a decade.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's created a family.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all of these weird, sensitive things
that have all come together to support it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, I haven't raised any money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for family and friends and
resources from relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: To scale this up, would you go for a
bigger, like a six-figure raise or
[SPEAKER_05]: something?
I would love to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, wouldn't that be great?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you do all your research, you and your
partner, and how do you do it,
[SPEAKER_08]: and where do you do it, and how do you
come up with these formulations?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without giving any proprietary... Okay,
so if you look at all the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_04]: companies in business right now,
and then you look at the market in like
[SPEAKER_04]: the early 1900s, like Eli Lilly and all of
these companies were making cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: extracts then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought about including a slide,
but I thought that'd be weird because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like ancient artifacts.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't know what the active
constituents in cannabis were.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't know we had an endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: But doctors have been formulating with
cannabis and other botanicals since God
[SPEAKER_04]: was a boy, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you saying you're not reinventing the
wheel with all your research?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying that I used that as a source
for inspiration, but what we've learned
[SPEAKER_04]: from then till now, it allows you to
really pull into detail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a naturopathic physician,
I look at things from like a nutritional
[SPEAKER_04]: or functional level.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like you can appreciate nuances
now because there's more science revealed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not so like broad acting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say, is that your only
business model?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or when you say you have the co-op
kitchen, is that a business model too?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is this your only business model in
terms of monetization?
[SPEAKER_08]: The products that you showed us,
the four products.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure I understand that question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a separate revenue stream?
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's separate, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But is that botanicals, that kitchen,
that co-op kitchen?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, pro-tanicals is the physician
formulated line from Mooroo.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mooroo is responsible for offering the
shared use kitchen space and the
[SPEAKER_04]: cooperative distribution services.
[SPEAKER_08]: So is botanicals a product of Mooroo or a
subsidiary of Mooroo?
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a line of products by Mooroo.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're Mooroo products.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a product line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted it to be pro because it's
professionally botanical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Botanical and formulated.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Mooroo does do other things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Mooroo does do other things.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, that's kind of what I'm hanging on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you guys have brand presence now in
retail across the state, right?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, Cliff, you got one, buddy?
[SPEAKER_08]: You good?
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have one, but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_11]: One more.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, Cliff.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I just wanted to know, you have those
four different products.
[SPEAKER_11]: How did you come to the?
[SPEAKER_11]: To the conclusion or how did you test it
that they work in those certain areas?
[SPEAKER_04]: So lots of these started as projects like
10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's interesting, like, I can't give
you the details, but it just so happened
[SPEAKER_04]: that a favorite combination of mine that
worked really well for anxiety,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially, you know, I don't know,
there were some challenging times.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a combination of two plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the last five years, we've seen
research that's like, oh, that botanical
[SPEAKER_04]: works on the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I like that combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as we start learning about
parasympathetic or sympathetic activity or
[SPEAKER_04]: immune tone or all of these things coming
out in medical research is only supporting
[SPEAKER_04]: the refinement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way I'm looking at this is like
this is just like the and it's like from
[SPEAKER_04]: there we can get the feedback and like
really curate and reassess and redefine
[SPEAKER_04]: what these are going to look like.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're saying some of your anecdotal
presumptions are actually being affirmed
now?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm suggesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and it's documented now in scientific
literature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like part that and then like
PubMed searches, botanical searches,
[SPEAKER_04]: going to medically minded inspired
conferences.
[SPEAKER_04]: The research is happening, which is really
cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Dr. Vanderplug.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now the judges will confer and discuss
your flaws in secret.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's hear it again for the competitors
and the judges.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, let's hear it again for the
contestants and the judges.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll use this microphone now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I now hold in my head the winner of the
inaugural Monmouth pot pitch contest,
[SPEAKER_10]: the dank tank receiving $10,000 and other
considerations.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please put your hands in the hands
together and let's welcome the winners.
[SPEAKER_10]: The greener side.
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations, Joe and Chelsea.
[SPEAKER_10]: One more time for the greener side.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cliff Robinson, Lee Henderson.
[SPEAKER_10]: The greener side.
Cliff Robinson, Lee Henderson.
The greener side.
