[SPEAKER_09]: I said, are you ready?
[SPEAKER_09]: This next panel is very exciting.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Canopy Rivers Pitch Day.
[SPEAKER_09]: What does it say?
[SPEAKER_09]: Micro cannabis, macro impact.
[SPEAKER_09]: You understand?
[SPEAKER_09]: So we got four different companies coming
up here.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all living the dream and hoping to
see their dreams realized.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to pitch their business to
our four judges.
[SPEAKER_09]: And our judges are going to pick one with
the best pitch.
[SPEAKER_09]: The best pitch.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like a tongue twister.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get in trouble in school.
[SPEAKER_09]: The ones with the best pitch.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're going to be picked up for
future development.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to receive a media package
from Civilize.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all kind of wonderful, wonderful
different things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_09]: And everybody's excited.
[SPEAKER_09]: And are you ready to start?
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to introduce the judges.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're just going to start the
pitches.
[SPEAKER_09]: Each business will have six minutes to
make their best pitch.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's longer than an elevator, but shorter
than a lunch meeting.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a six minute pitch.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the judges, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You understand?
[SPEAKER_09]: And the judges, you got to have your
elevator pitch ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the judges are going to have four
minutes to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they're going to huddle up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're going to announce the
winner.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's all going to be butter tarts and
pie.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you ready to meet the judges?
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, are you ready to meet the judges?
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to start off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear it for Kirk Toussaint.
You
[SPEAKER_09]: want to say anything before we go?
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to go on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear it for Olivier Dufour-Montel,
Matt Barron, and Hilary Black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Olivier Dufour-Montel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one wearing the velvet jacket
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cozy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working at Canopy Growth for
three years and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year ago, I was involved with the start
of Canopy Rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've joined Canopy Rivers as COO a
month ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, you beautiful people.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Hilary Black.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started the first medical cannabis
organization in the country 22 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I now work with Canopy Growth as the
director of patient education and
[SPEAKER_01]: advocacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've come a long ways in this movement
and industry since it was a girl with a
[SPEAKER_01]: pager and a backpack and a bicycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is exciting times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really pleased to be helping these
awesome folks get their companies up and
[SPEAKER_01]: off the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to ICBC for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to Canopy Rivers for the invitation
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Kirk Toussaint.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a lawyer that's represented
dispensaries and medical patients and
[SPEAKER_07]: producers in Canada for many years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's actually quite an honor to be on
stage with Hilary, who is one of my
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis idols here in Canada,
for her incredibly inspirational activism.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the spirit of transitions,
I'm going to be doing a little bit of
[SPEAKER_07]: consulting with Canopy Growth Corporation
as well and trying to help them bridge the
[SPEAKER_07]: gaps that exist between the VC industry
and big business, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's an honor to be on this panel with
her.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Matt Barron.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been growing weed for 23 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been growing also for the Compassion
Clubs of Canada for the last 17 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I fought the government and BC Supreme
Court challenge with my good friend,
[SPEAKER_08]: Kirk Toussaint, that we won that
constitutional challenge.
[SPEAKER_08]: And speaking of transitions, I too am
going to be taking on the role of
[SPEAKER_08]: consultant with Canopy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I look forward to the future of
legalization that's going to happen on
[SPEAKER_08]: October 17.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's going to be a good time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the four judges.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are the judges ready?
We're ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the crowd ready?
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to bring up the first
contestants right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike Matthews from Bella Vista Farms.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Matthews Farm is a fifth generation
family farm located two hours east of
[SPEAKER_09]: Toronto.
[SPEAKER_09]: And within 200 acres, Mike Matthews has
been cultivating organic outdoor cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: The company intends to enter the
recreational market to produce premium
[SPEAKER_09]: organic farm grown cannabis by first
approaching micro cultivation and
[SPEAKER_09]: eventually adding on higher margin
products through a processing license.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear it for Mike Matthews and Bella
Vista Farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an organic farmer, as mentioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a cannabis cultivator and the founder
of Bella Vista Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a fifth generation farmer on our
certified organic farm two hours east of
[SPEAKER_05]: Toronto, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been cultivating cannabis medically
under various licenses for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I've been working with the land,
I've looked out across the industrial
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis production landscape and know
that there is a better way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Industrial cannabis cultivation is
expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is sometimes not so good for the
environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And quality is often sacrificed for
quantity.
[SPEAKER_05]: At Bella Vista, we know that in terms of
work and input for plant life,
[SPEAKER_05]: nature has been doing a pretty good job
for countless millennia.
[SPEAKER_05]: We look to embrace these natural systems
and processes, amplify them, and put them
[SPEAKER_05]: to work for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll tell you a little bit about that
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are asking for $800,000 in startup
capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the majority of that will be going to
a greenhouse to execute our three-year
[SPEAKER_05]: plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'll tell you a little bit about our
farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: My great, great, great grandfather settled
on our farm 170 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is my grandfather here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be his grandson.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is him standing next to his Bella
Vista orchards truck.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I, Robert Michael Matthews V,
look to carry our family tradition into a
[SPEAKER_05]: new era with Bella Vista cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll introduce you to the team that
will execute our three-year plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 20 years of combined policy,
regulatory, and project management
[SPEAKER_05]: expertise.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these skill sets with regulatory
compliance and combined with my 20 years
[SPEAKER_05]: farming experience is really an ideal
skill set to bring our cannabis plan to
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our farm has been certified organic since
1999.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've developed and maintained various
sales channels to deliver our products to
[SPEAKER_05]: domestic and international markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've sold oats to Quaker Oats Company,
organic soybeans to the Japanese market
[SPEAKER_05]: for tofu, and many other crops for various
other organic food ingredients.
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of cannabis, in 2008 I partnered
with Red Canoe Cannabis to serve medical
[SPEAKER_05]: patients under the MMAR licensing system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in 2014 we sold genetics and flour to
Tweed Incorporated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'll tell you a little bit about our
method.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll provide a little bit of context
with a quote from a Canadian press
[SPEAKER_05]: journalist, Laura Kane, where she notes
that as Canada nears cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization, it is only so green for the
environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: We aim to change that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We look to work with nature, not without.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one interesting example of this is the
power of compost.
[SPEAKER_05]: One very large, massive pile of compost
consisting of manure and wood chips can
[SPEAKER_05]: produce heat temperature heights of 180
degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's 80 degrees or 82 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's extremely hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so with a compost heat recovery system
and heat exchange fans, we can harness
[SPEAKER_05]: this energy source, can heat buildings,
lower your heating costs with the
[SPEAKER_05]: supplementary heating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Furthermore, the decomposition of this
matter is a great growing medium.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be used for compost teas,
for foliar sprays, of course, and to
[SPEAKER_05]: inoculate the rhizosphere, the root
system, the root zone of plants with
[SPEAKER_05]: beneficial microbes, beneficial bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: The list goes on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just one of the many different
tools and concepts that we have the
[SPEAKER_05]: ability to do on our farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's look at our competitive analysis.
[SPEAKER_05]: This table shows cash production cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a metric in which we look to
outperform.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our cost saving strategy involves
reductions across the board.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this way, we can bring our continuous
innovation and the integration of our
[SPEAKER_05]: systems that are all on farm to produce
low cost but very, very high quality farm
[SPEAKER_05]: grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next step is the construction of our
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be a 5,000 square foot gutter
connect greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are currently in discussions with
contractors, suppliers, and engineers and
[SPEAKER_05]: can begin construction in as little as 12
months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our three year plan will be executed in
two phases.
[SPEAKER_05]: Phase one has seen the completion of our
business plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be applying for micro licenses as
soon as they become available.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our greenhouse construction is penciled in
here for early 2019, but again,
[SPEAKER_05]: we can do sooner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our first harvest and testing is projected
to be for late 2019.
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, phase two is the beginning of
our build out for our vertical integration
[SPEAKER_05]: plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is just the beginning of it here
with our processing facility and
[SPEAKER_05]: construction so we can take our farm grown
products and move into extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are seeking $800,000 in startup capital
to execute our three year plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: The majority of the cost will go towards
our greenhouse and we expect in addition
[SPEAKER_05]: to our core team to hire a staff of five
individuals in the beginning for day to
[SPEAKER_05]: day operations.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the team, the skill set,
the experience, the farmland, and the
[SPEAKER_05]: passion and the vision.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are very excited about the future
of Bella Vista Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a very simple question,
which is a technical question.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow cannabis under the current
regime, there's strict rules around micro
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, the amount of bacterias and
microbes on the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge that organic cultivation has
is there are a lot of alive organism in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you plan on resolving that issue
and produce organic product that passes
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulatory requirements?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to the best of my knowledge so far,
I don't know if they're going to paint
[SPEAKER_05]: with one broad brush and count all
different types of bacteria as being
[SPEAKER_05]: unsafe for consumption or if they will
just specify the more unsafe ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would definitely be assessing the
situation as things move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Foliar sprays in such a case might not be
used in flowering, maybe just during the
[SPEAKER_05]: vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in terms of maybe soil bacteria or
something, I just think where there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: will, there's a way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it would be some type of mulch
cover.
[SPEAKER_05]: The beneficials are completely safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got bacteria all over skin and so
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, it does really matter what the
regulations are going to be with that in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of the bacterial count and what they
will be identifying as safe or unsafe.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we have our eyes on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And great pitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for coming all the way to
Ontario to be here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question for you is I'm wondering if
you can tell us about one of the patients
[SPEAKER_01]: that you worked with early on in your
cannabis cultivation that has inspired you
[SPEAKER_01]: to go down the path of being a medicine
maker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, really quite early on.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned, like when I partnered with
Red Canoe Cannabis in 2008, I saw a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: different cases of different patients with
different needs.
[SPEAKER_05]: One in particular had Crohn's.
[SPEAKER_05]: And medical cannabis was a life changer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We even had her come out to our gardens to
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was very much therapeutic in and
of itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: She'd also require quite a lot of cannabis
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of a success story in the
medical realm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for taking the opportunity to tell
us about your passion.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It obviously does come through.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have sort of two questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a curiosity question and I have
like a Dragon's Den, Kevin O'Leary type
[SPEAKER_07]: question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have time for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the clock's ticking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll ask you the curiosity one first.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if the mic swings back, I'll ask you
the tougher one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got 10 years of experience
cultivating organic outdoor cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: The federal government is contemplating
licensing organic or legal growth and
[SPEAKER_07]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why the switch to greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_07]: What motivated that decision?
[SPEAKER_05]: To be completely honest, I was
flip-flopping on this for months upon
[SPEAKER_05]: months about trying to decide if I should
be greenhouse or do outdoor for extracts
[SPEAKER_05]: or oils and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, I kind of like to do both.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hopefully have a huge passion for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I would love to do greenhouse
for the high quality and especially craft
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then yeah, maybe outdoor for of course
extracts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Having grown organic outdoors,
obviously you sort of swayed away from
[SPEAKER_08]: growing longer flowering sativas outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You surprised.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I can get crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they took my pictures.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to add one more minute to the
questioning round.
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody will get five minutes instead
of four minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could bring my presentation back
up, that would be cool if that could
[SPEAKER_05]: happen again.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're still running out of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you could explain getting into
sativas outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear a lot of that, but I've had great
success growing sativas outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flower in many cases might not be
quite as dense as it could be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Given our temperate region, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I have a great, great THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of my favorite products, I'm all
about THC myself for my own consumption.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I've had, Steve is growing out
into November.
[SPEAKER_05]: Frost can become an issue, but it takes
like minus seven or something to really
[SPEAKER_05]: get into doing some damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll ask the tough question.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to get in the numbers here a
little bit then.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got an $800,000 ask and you said a
majority of that is for greenhouse
[SPEAKER_07]: construction.
[SPEAKER_07]: About half of that's actually for
greenhouse construction, $400,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got $300,000 in salary and wages
here, which is a substantial chunk of this
[SPEAKER_07]: over three years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's that going to?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the sort of core team or is it these
individuals that you're planning to hire
[SPEAKER_07]: or a mix of the two?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me tell you this.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it all comes down to it, we're going
to be needing and asking for more than
[SPEAKER_05]: $800,000 to be totally honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's your answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're actually out of time.
[SPEAKER_09]: The guy with the money's at this end,
so.
[SPEAKER_09]: And here we have Thomas Fraley from
Bavaria Farms Lab Testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're an independent lab providing
cannabis producers with regulatory
[SPEAKER_09]: mandated batch testing services and
scientific support.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear it for Thomas Fraley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, ICBC.
[SPEAKER_04]: As mentioned, my name is Thomas Fraley.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the president and founder of Bavarian
Laboratories and I'm here to talk to you
[SPEAKER_04]: today about why an investment in cannabis
testing is not only a good financial
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity but critical for the success
of our industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Health Canada mandates lab testing of each
batch of cannabis or cannabis product
[SPEAKER_04]: before it's released for sales to
consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a lot of attention and
investment in the industry in scaling up
[SPEAKER_04]: production capabilities, but very little
focus paid attention to the capacity in
[SPEAKER_04]: the testing market to test these products
that are being produced.
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So more a little bit about us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a 2,800 square foot site located
in Mississauga beside Pearson Airport.
[SPEAKER_04]: We filed for an LD application in May of
2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: We raised just north of $1 million in our
early financing activities.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an anticipated go live date of our
testing services in fall of 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are seeking $500,000 of additional
financing from Canopy Rivers for capital
[SPEAKER_04]: equipment upgrades.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will spend this money very soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will spend this money very fast,
likely within the first year, likely
[SPEAKER_04]: within the first six months.
[SPEAKER_04]: As mentioned, our team brings together 40
plus years of testing and life sciences
[SPEAKER_04]: industry experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prior to beginning this venture,
I was working with Sigma Aldrich
[SPEAKER_04]: Corporation down in the United States in
contract manufacturing partnerships for
[SPEAKER_04]: diagnostic tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some experience with plant
analytical chemistry through the National
[SPEAKER_04]: Research Council of Canada in Saskatchewan
and I have some experience with plant
[SPEAKER_04]: tissue culture and molecular biology as
well too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our quality manager's name is Dallas
Takeuchi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only is he an accomplished analytical
chemist, but he has 24 years of testing
[SPEAKER_04]: lab auditing experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very nice to have a quality manager
who is an ISO auditor as well too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Angelica Gordon is our lead analytical
chemist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prior to joining us, her and her
colleagues set up and ran a pesticide
[SPEAKER_04]: testing laboratory in Columbia where they
screened all types of produce from across
[SPEAKER_04]: South America for over 200 different types
of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our operations and administration manager,
Paul Kelendon, joins us from Estee Lauder
[SPEAKER_04]: MAC Cosmetics where previously he was in
charge of consumer event strategy and
[SPEAKER_04]: execution.
[SPEAKER_04]: We currently have an open position for our
lead microbiologist.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there are any talented microbiologists
in the audience, please come chat with me
[SPEAKER_04]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here are the tests that are required by
Health Canada currently on each batch of
[SPEAKER_04]: dried cannabis or oil product released to
the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: The regs for concentrates in food products
are still TBD, but we imagine they will
[SPEAKER_04]: mirror this somewhat.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the exception of the four and matter
test and dry weight test, which are fairly
[SPEAKER_04]: easy, conducting the remainder of these
tests requires a fairly advanced chemistry
[SPEAKER_04]: lab and a fairly advanced microbiology
lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same equipment and processes that we
invest in to bring these testings online
[SPEAKER_04]: can also be used to provide our customers
with more custom bespoke testing services
[SPEAKER_04]: to help support them with their process
and product development.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we see the cannabis market
looking like under the Cannabis Act here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We created kind of a heat map with red
being the area of hottest business
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the cultivators, the micro
cultivators, the processors and the
[SPEAKER_04]: microprocessors, because this is where
Health Canada has requirements on
[SPEAKER_04]: mandatory laboratory batch testing for
each batch of product.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see secondary business opportunities in
other areas of the ecosystem as well too.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, you could be a nursery trying
to breed a strain of cannabis that's high
[SPEAKER_04]: in CBG.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could support your breeding program
with our testing services.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could be a hemp cultivator looking to
determine how much CBD is in your hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: crop that you've harvested this year
before you sell it onto a processor.
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition, as good manufacturing
practices or GMP becomes more entrenched
[SPEAKER_04]: in the Canadian cannabis industry,
one requirement for our customers will be
[SPEAKER_04]: process validation in order to get their
GMP accreditation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Process validation requires an element of
testing to prove your validation is on
[SPEAKER_04]: track as well too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be able to support our customers
with achieving GMP accreditation as well
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are already a handful of labs out
there that service the existing licensed
[SPEAKER_04]: producers and I'm not here to say today
that anyone is doing any subpar sciences
[SPEAKER_04]: or any faulty testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, the major challenge in the
industry today is capacity issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hear stories of turnaround times in
excess of four weeks at some sites and
[SPEAKER_04]: some labs actually advising quality
managers at LPs today that they should
[SPEAKER_04]: start looking for a second source lab
testing provider because they are
[SPEAKER_04]: anticipating capacity issues as the
Cannabis Act passes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We face some competition from our
customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well-funded LPs are able to open their own
internal laboratories to conduct some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The exception is the pesticide testing
which under the Cannabis Act will always
[SPEAKER_04]: have to be mandatory third party with a
laboratory like us.
[SPEAKER_04]: As micro cultivators and microprocessors
enter the market, it's very unlikely that
[SPEAKER_04]: these customers will invest in opening
their own internal laboratories because
[SPEAKER_04]: the economics won't make sense for the
scale of their operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit more about how we plan to do
business.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be a cannabis first laboratory.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, our customers' cannabis
samples will not compete with potatoes for
[SPEAKER_04]: instrument time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be investing and focusing on
developing a streamlined digital customer
[SPEAKER_04]: experience for sample submission and
archival of your certificates of analysis
[SPEAKER_04]: and test results.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are conveniently located adjacent to
Pearson Airport, which means we can
[SPEAKER_04]: receive next day delivery from across the
country, allowing us to service producers
[SPEAKER_04]: from coast to coast with their batch
testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will also be a one stop shop for all
your testing needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some labs focus just on the chemistry,
just on the micro.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will in fact do both.
[SPEAKER_04]: You only need one provider to achieve your
batch testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little on the licensing note,
as I mentioned earlier, we filed an NLD
[SPEAKER_04]: application in May of 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the current framework that
cannabis testing labs operate in industry
[SPEAKER_04]: today.
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be a new permit created under
the Cannabis Act called an analytical
[SPEAKER_04]: permit.
[SPEAKER_04]: All existing cannabis testing labs will
have to reapply for this permit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The go live date of this permit is
currently unknown.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a little short on time, so for our
go to market plan, the main takeaway is
[SPEAKER_04]: that we intend on beginning our commercial
operations at the end of Q3, beginning of
[SPEAKER_04]: Q4 of this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here are some of our sales forecasts and
potential revenue that you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: At year five, we would like to get between
five and 600 samples per month of both the
[SPEAKER_04]: full batch testing where a customer is
coming to us for a full panel of tests and
[SPEAKER_04]: an equal volume of the standalone
pesticide test where a customer has their
[SPEAKER_04]: own lab and is coming to us for just a
pesticide test.
[SPEAKER_04]: This volume by all means does exist in the
market today.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at some of the advertised
production capacities of the larger
[SPEAKER_04]: producers, thousands of kilograms per
month and divide that by a batch size of
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 to 100 kilograms, you're seeing a
positive opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll let you springboard into where you
were going to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Talk to us about your sales forecasts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I notice you're projecting a pretty huge
jump in year over year growth from year
[SPEAKER_07]: one 2018 to year two 2019.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you think you're going to see it
looks like about a 20 fold increase in
[SPEAKER_07]: revenues from year one to year two?
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly, as more customers come into
market, there will be more opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will also be building out our sales
team as well as our technicians and
[SPEAKER_04]: operating team in the laboratory to
process that additional capacity as well
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in our plans at the moment,
we have plans for a sales force that will
[SPEAKER_04]: be driving that growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for packing a lot of information
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, we're a few years in the future and
you have experienced this exponential
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and you have juicy profit margins.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would your company do to give back?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would your dream be around social
responsibility venture of some kind?
[SPEAKER_04]: With the science sector in general,
particularly with the chemistry aspect,
[SPEAKER_04]: there are lots of opportunities to green
the activities in that space a lot more.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, we can examine switching one
chemical with another.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, we will consume a lot of
helium in our operations for our gas phase
[SPEAKER_04]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a very unsustainable resource
that's harvested from the earth and
[SPEAKER_04]: mining.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once it's used, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually validate the use of
hydrogen instead for your gas phase
[SPEAKER_04]: analysis, but that takes time and effort
to run the two in parallel to show that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're equivalent.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had all the unlimited time and
resources that I could, I would love to
[SPEAKER_04]: invest more into greening our efforts,
publishing those publicly as application
[SPEAKER_04]: notes so that other labs could use those
as well too because I don't see any
[SPEAKER_04]: benefit for us to keep that internally for
our own operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about the fact that there is
more demand and supply at the moment and
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually, the supply will catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question about your financial
projection because you're showing an
[SPEAKER_00]: acceleration of sales despite the fact
that there is more supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're also showing, I think I just
calculated quickly, an increase in your
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar per sales at the same time,
which would imply that you're getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: money out of every test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you help us understand how is the
commoditization going to impact your
[SPEAKER_00]: business and how will you remain relevant
when there is more supply than demand?
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize if the numbers presented
anything to the contrary, but in our
[SPEAKER_04]: calculations, we didn't account for any
kind of making more on each test as we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: To answer your question with regards to
the commoditization, in the short term,
[SPEAKER_04]: we will benefit from the lack of capacity,
which will give us an advantage,
[SPEAKER_04]: but longer term, that's not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's really going to take over is going
to be the more custom type testing
[SPEAKER_04]: services that we provide to our customers
to help them improve their processes and
[SPEAKER_04]: make better products that will allow us to
guard and also keep growing the base core
[SPEAKER_04]: routine testing despite the fact that's
becoming a little bit more commoditized as
[SPEAKER_04]: well too.
[SPEAKER_08]: My question pertains more to personal use
because I use the labs a lot and they get
[SPEAKER_08]: really expensive really quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I like to ask the labs a lot is,
do you have a group rate?
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of me coming in single source,
I want a rate for the month and I can give
[SPEAKER_08]: you as many tests as I can jam in for that
month and then have a single price.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of labs out there,
I know, in the United States that offer
[SPEAKER_08]: breeders and growers bulk discount
scenarios.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Given volume expectations and projections,
we'd certainly expect to offer scale
[SPEAKER_04]: discounts based on the volume.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if we could agree that it
would be $1,000 for the month regardless
[SPEAKER_04]: of 10 samples or 10,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if we could necessarily agree
to that, but certainly as far as discount
[SPEAKER_04]: scale goes, that's something that we would
be able to offer as well too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to throw away there, I noticed that
you didn't have terpenes on your list of
[SPEAKER_08]: things that you tested.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terpenes is not a mandatory batch test
requirement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terpenes is something that we will
certainly be able to offer testing
[SPEAKER_04]: services for with the equipment that we're
buying to provide those batch testing
[SPEAKER_04]: services.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have it listed because Health
Canada does not require you to test for
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes on each batch.
[SPEAKER_09]: 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_09]: No pressure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for your time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was very informative and interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: The next pitch will come from Cannabis
Arms or Chris Helena.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a cultivation monitoring software.
[SPEAKER_09]: It stands for analytics, research,
management system.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a purpose-built intelligent light
system which provides cultivators with
[SPEAKER_09]: actionable information to monitor their
grows.
[SPEAKER_09]: The company is led by Chris Helena who
brings a decade of federal government
[SPEAKER_09]: experience primarily with the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police and is partnered
[SPEAKER_09]: with Proxologica Corporation, a
professional engineering team with two
[SPEAKER_09]: decades of experience designing complex
high-speed circuit boards.
[SPEAKER_09]: The company aims to get their product to
market later this year or early next.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear it for Chris Helena.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, dragons.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to skip the first part here.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Cannabis Arms platform is an
intelligent, complete solution to monitor,
[SPEAKER_06]: track, light, measure, and improve
licensed cannabis grow operations in
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada and around the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: The overall project budget, finance-wise,
is $2 million, some of which has already
[SPEAKER_06]: been raised for this strategic
partnership.
[SPEAKER_06]: The funds will be used to field test beta
units and essentially fine-tune the design
[SPEAKER_06]: of everything and make sure that this is
the best that we can make it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're looking at commercial production
by summer 2019.
[SPEAKER_06]: So over the next two years, the top 15
licensed publicly traded producers are
[SPEAKER_06]: forecasting about a tenfold increase in
the square footage of grow-op space.
[SPEAKER_06]: So given that size, we're looking at a
potential market of about 800,000
[SPEAKER_06]: sentinels, which is a device that I'll
show you in a minute here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the world is watching Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, as other countries start to
come into the fold with the same sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: legislation, we're going to see that
market continue to increase.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ARMS project is a limited partnership
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I represent the general partner.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as mentioned in my lovely
introduction, I've worked for the RCMP for
[SPEAKER_06]: quite a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: My job was negotiating and drafting
agreements with municipalities all the way
[SPEAKER_06]: up to federal government agencies.
[SPEAKER_06]: About a year ago, I went to work for a
company called WolfPod Data Centers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been in business for two decades,
and they have all of the usual things that
[SPEAKER_06]: an internet service provider has on offer,
business networking, server co-location,
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: In one of our projects, we got together
with Dr. David Southwell and his team at
[SPEAKER_06]: Proxologica to work on a disaster recovery
cloud.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're experts in the supercomputer
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been working with companies like
IBM and Hewlett Packard, organizations
[SPEAKER_06]: like NASA, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: military and intelligence communities.
[SPEAKER_06]: And various international research
institutions as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So over the last year, they've been
developing a proprietary analytics
[SPEAKER_06]: technology, high performance computing in
areas like genetics and smart cities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that involves an enormous,
enormous amount of data.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with their assistance ongoing,
we have licensed this technology for the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis industry worldwide.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll also be putting together a technical
advisory committee made up of licensed
[SPEAKER_06]: growers, regulators, and research
institutions to give us feedback and make
[SPEAKER_06]: sure that everything's perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's talk about what it actually is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Analytics direct on the floor information
gathering from a device that's hung just
[SPEAKER_06]: above the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It brings in information locally through a
variety of sensors, computes that
[SPEAKER_06]: information locally, and sends the useful
data to a remote data center.
[SPEAKER_06]: The information is sent encrypted via an
auditable ledger, both in flight and at
[SPEAKER_06]: rest.
[SPEAKER_06]: To ensure data integrity, and then it's
analyzed there and sent back to the
[SPEAKER_06]: operator in a much more useful fashion.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next piece is research.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're looking to provide is an eye in
the sky over the entire facility,
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to eliminate human error.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be working with private laboratories
and universities to try and help them
[SPEAKER_06]: prove effectively, once and for all,
what are optimal grow conditions.
[SPEAKER_06]: The next thing is management.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every facility could have hundreds or even
thousands of these devices over their
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll have common sensors like
temperature and humidity, things that
[SPEAKER_06]: you're already measuring, but also
uncommon ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: A multispectral camera, which can detect
very specific wavelengths of light,
[SPEAKER_06]: can detect things like the chlorophyll
levels in a plant, the health of the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant, pests in your facility,
and also where they are in the facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll also provide all of the light that
the plant needs to grow, whether LED or
[SPEAKER_06]: phosphorus or some other technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: Depending on what the operator wants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultimately, if your CAPEX budget's already
spent, that is only one feature of the
[SPEAKER_06]: device itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my favorite slide, because I get
to show you what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_06]: We call them sentinels.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a central processing core with all of
the sensors and cameras mounted on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cameras provide live security video
feed, and because you're dealing with a
[SPEAKER_06]: large number of these, this can help you
comply with Health Canada's every inch of
[SPEAKER_06]: your facility that needs to be covered.
[SPEAKER_06]: The device can track the position of
individual plants, people, and equipment,
[SPEAKER_06]: whether moving or stationary.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I mentioned, all of the information
is sent encrypted, secure to a remote data
[SPEAKER_06]: center for disaster recovery as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've also already begun discussions with
the industry, part of the reason that
[SPEAKER_06]: we're here, of course, as well as
regulators and researchers to start
[SPEAKER_06]: building out that technical advisory
committee.
[SPEAKER_06]: At this stage, we're open to strategic
investment.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're flexible on the type of entity or
finance instruments that are used.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bulk of the money that we receive will
be used to configure and refine and
[SPEAKER_06]: perfect this device, because at the end of
the day, the hardware design has already
[SPEAKER_06]: been designed, it's been completed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our initial estimates, we expect to be
able to replace lighting, tracking,
[SPEAKER_06]: and security systems for just a fraction
of today's cost.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our seed round is oversubscribed.
[SPEAKER_06]: By October, we'll have 100 sentinels ready
to roll out to our strategic partners.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the moment, we're seeking $1.75
million over three tranches from October
[SPEAKER_06]: until May, with an official launch in
summer of 2019.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis Arms Platform represents the
culmination of decades of data management,
[SPEAKER_06]: data movement, analysis, and security
experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been designed in such a way that it
can replace light security and even
[SPEAKER_06]: staffing resources as an all-in-one
intelligence suite to try and drive
[SPEAKER_06]: efficiency across the board for growth in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I throw myself at the mercy of the
judges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my question was also gonna be around
the environmental impacts of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: if this multifunctional device is gonna
replace a lot of other gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wonder if there's any other
additional eco footprint improvements you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanna speak to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, I'm just wondering if
you're open to a comment, that's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this device sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my comment is that the word arms and
sentinel, it has a bit of a military vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while I think that this device is
potentially an incredible evolution of the
[SPEAKER_01]: technology in our system, maybe one part
of the process is we can rebrand it and
[SPEAKER_01]: make it a little more loving and warm
somehow.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could call it a... It looks a little
like a flower, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: We could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we could have a good brainstorm
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can do it at the after party
later and have a jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How we can warm up the feeling of it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as the eco impact, when I was
talking about it being able to recognize
[SPEAKER_06]: pests in the facility, one of the things
that happens a lot right now is blanket
[SPEAKER_06]: spraying of the entire facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can nail down, this is the section
of four or five plants and we can get
[SPEAKER_06]: early detection of those pests showing up,
then you can spot treat rather than doing
[SPEAKER_06]: the entire facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've heard of situations where
companies have had to throw away an entire
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouse worth of product because it was
a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you can catch it early,
it's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: One might be a quick straightforward
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned earlier it's purpose built
for indoor application.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you including greenhouse in the
category of indoor application?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis is obviously not the first plant
that's been grown at scale in greenhouses
[SPEAKER_07]: for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a pretty highly developed food
industry out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to imagine that food producers,
for example, have in existence technology
[SPEAKER_07]: that is sampling the environment,
sampling the temperature, sampling the
[SPEAKER_07]: moles hit in the plant, doing the kind of
things that the soon to be renamed
[SPEAKER_07]: Sentinel is going to be doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you going to penetrate what I
think is probably a very well developed
[SPEAKER_07]: market for greenhouse plant reporting
technology?
[SPEAKER_06]: In our research, it's not nearly as well
developed as one would think.
[SPEAKER_06]: And our suspicion is, is because the crop
is very low value on an individual plant
[SPEAKER_06]: basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, LED is something that is taking
off but hasn't really replaced everything,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is, you know, evidenced by a lot of
the greenhouses in cannabis still using
[SPEAKER_06]: the old high pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we haven't been able to find anything
that really consolidates all of these
[SPEAKER_06]: pieces into a single focal point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Preva comes to mind for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a greenhouse monitoring system.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, I'm going to raffle off a few
questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: How big is this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Four foot by four foot area.
[SPEAKER_08]: So is it, so does it like sticks to the
roof?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what those sort of arms do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're those, those arms are removable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're at in this particular design,
they're LED.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they can be removed to change the
different kinds of lights or things along
[SPEAKER_06]: those lines.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the square footage coverage of each
unit?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like how many would you need for four foot
by four foot for each?
[SPEAKER_08]: So for every four foot by four foot,
you would need another one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now at the moment, as I say, the physical
design is something that we're looking for
[SPEAKER_06]: feedback on, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll work with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you sort of get into one of Canopy's
greenhouses, a million square feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the cost of one of these units?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have an exact cost, but we're well
under a thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you built one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a prototype?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have prototypes that we've constructed
or prototype design, but one that looks
[SPEAKER_06]: like this at this particular design,
not yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's October.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have a hundred of them built.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotta have the dragons in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got 11 seconds, 12 seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, that's over.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's over.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in trouble now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So tell me a little bit more then about
how it can detect bugs on a plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you do it in like 20 seconds?
[SPEAKER_06]: 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So pine beetles in BC, they use a $200,000
camera on a plane and they fly it over the
[SPEAKER_06]: forest.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're only a few feet away from the
plant, you don't need a $200,000 camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So essentially it does the same kind of
thing where you're looking for a
[SPEAKER_06]: particular light signature, but because
you're so much closer, you can do it with
[SPEAKER_06]: a much less expensive product.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like an infrared or something?
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd have to talk to the engineer about
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the Stash Canter Group, Jorah
Frazier, grower and branded products.
[SPEAKER_09]: The SC Group is developing branded
products based on existing consumer demand
[SPEAKER_09]: backed by producing high quality BC bud.
[SPEAKER_09]: We love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The company has amassed a strong British
Columbia based team in cultivation and is
[SPEAKER_09]: building out the other facets of its
business.
[SPEAKER_09]: The company has developed some of its own
products, packaging, brands and trademarks
[SPEAKER_09]: and plans to focus strongly on British
Columbia before expanding across Canada.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stash Canter Group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all for being here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to just quickly introduce
ourselves again.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Brom Candy and this is Jorah
Frazier and we're here representing the
[SPEAKER_03]: Stash Canter Group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get started, obviously,
I just want to thank ICBC and Canopy
[SPEAKER_02]: Rivers providing us a stage here to get to
meet all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our panelists here for lending your
expertise and grilling us with some
[SPEAKER_02]: questions and also a personal shout out to
Daniel Pearlstein who helped us put the
[SPEAKER_02]: pitch together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, we're here to tell you why
we're after the million bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: No comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Stash Canter Group, we're really
committed to sharing the love and passion
[SPEAKER_02]: that a lot of our BC network of cannabis
professionals have been involved with and
[SPEAKER_02]: creating excellence for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really based on authentic
communication and really being fully
[SPEAKER_02]: engaged with where the market's at and
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a little bit more about the SC
Group.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a group of over 30 individuals that
come from the cannabis space as well from
[SPEAKER_03]: other industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's super dedicated to our company
and seeing us succeed in the future legal
[SPEAKER_03]: rec market.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've reinvested all the money since we've
started our business in 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have amazing growers that have been
producing some of the top quality stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: here in BC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're asking for the money that's
going to go towards retail storefronts and
[SPEAKER_03]: micro-cultivation licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, it all starts with quality
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have two growers, each with over 15
years experience growing amazing quality
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're super stoked to be working with
these passionate individuals and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: right on the leading edge of quality craft
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've also blessed to be working with
someone with some ISO experience managing
[SPEAKER_02]: some international breweries at a high
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me personally, I'm most proud of my cousin
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's done an amazing job focusing on the
biz ops over the last year and to have our
[SPEAKER_02]: lives kind of serendipitously end up,
you know, riding this wave together has
[SPEAKER_02]: been pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Likewise, it's a pleasure and honor to
work with my cousin here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like brothers and it's a family
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a wealth of experience in
branding, marketing, film and media and
[SPEAKER_03]: has co-founded a digital creative agency
that's done over 10 million in sales to
[SPEAKER_03]: date.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been an amazing journey and we're
really excited to be here in this room
[SPEAKER_02]: right now with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: As mentioned before, we've been investing
a lot of time and care into developing a
[SPEAKER_02]: really excellent interdisciplinary team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our group of diverse people adequately
represents the cultural melting pot that's
[SPEAKER_02]: found in BC and everyone's really keen and
excited to get access to the market and
[SPEAKER_02]: start rocking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been developing and honing our
skills and process to focus on quality
[SPEAKER_02]: design and service right across through
every kind of micro interaction that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have with our client base and again,
just really focusing on the love and care
[SPEAKER_02]: and respecting people and helping them
come together and have a good time or deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with a typical time and on the medical
front.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, why are we here?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here to ask for funds from Canobie
Rivers that's going to be used to
[SPEAKER_03]: storefront retail expansion and as well as
micro cultivation licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the money going to be used for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, our growers are super
passionate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been touring other facilities,
drafting plants, they're on the cutting
[SPEAKER_03]: edge of modern technology for growing and
we're completely confident in their
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to produce amazing craft cannabis
here in BC that can be shared with Canada
[SPEAKER_03]: and hopefully the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also, fingers crossed, should have
branded craft cannabis on the store
[SPEAKER_03]: shelves come fall of next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of our corporate energy has been into
the retail to brand development and we'd
[SPEAKER_02]: like to continue the work and development
we've been doing in that regard and so
[SPEAKER_02]: we're looking to enter in and open up some
shops in the summer next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to do a quick shout out to
the audience here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone wants to learn a bit more about
what we have going on, what our plans are
[SPEAKER_03]: for the future or just to meet us on a
personal level, we'll be in the room next
[SPEAKER_03]: door after the presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I just want to thank you all for
spending such a beautiful little afternoon
[SPEAKER_02]: with us, the panel, but that's our
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks you much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll toss Mike over these guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: One more time, Stash Cannagroup,
short but sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was wondering if you could tell me an
impactful story of someone that you've
[SPEAKER_08]: helped in the medical marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be my mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: She has Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: She never did as a personal consumer and
she uses it mostly for the medication that
[SPEAKER_03]: she takes to help with the side effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think not only is it useful for
medical benefits directly but it also
[SPEAKER_03]: helps offset and can reduce the effects of
a lot of other harsh pharmaceuticals out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the great presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that you guys work with a
couple of my favorite extractors on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Gulf Islands and you also live on one of
the Gulf Islands, which is very close to
[SPEAKER_01]: home for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanna ask a little bit about your
staffing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a pretty big team of staff and
I imagine that with the retail locations
[SPEAKER_01]: you wanna open up, you're gonna have quite
a big team.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering if you can talk a little
bit more about your hiring practices and
[SPEAKER_01]: the diversity of your team and how
important it is to you around hiring
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse people to work in your company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that the cannabis company of
the future is really gonna have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: interdisciplinary and diverse and true to
the kind of nature of cannabis which
[SPEAKER_02]: brings people together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my gal, Raina, who I'm not sure is
here or not, she helped build my friend's
[SPEAKER_02]: company from 30 to 80 to 150 people in a
couple years.
[SPEAKER_02]: She kind of heads a lot of the outreach
and intake.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanna provide a good space for
my friends in network and all the freaks
[SPEAKER_02]: and weirdos out there to do their thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really working towards creating,
obviously, a gender balanced workplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got people from Turkey, Uganda,
every continent in the world, all the
[SPEAKER_02]: different sexual preferences, not really
an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a cross dressing head of our
warehouse who's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: We like to have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very exciting business idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just explain a little bit your
current business?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do and how does the
cultivation and retail tie in with the
[SPEAKER_00]: current business?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not so clear on how the big arc works.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like a vertically integrated group
similar to some of the people that spoke
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're into production, value added
products, building brands and also
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational brands that engage with
consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a small company but we're super
dedicated and passionate and I think we
[SPEAKER_03]: have a really good knowledge base to be
successful in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're taking kind of a holistic
approach, vertically integrated in
[SPEAKER_03]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of our work is done online because
Canadians support about 90% of all retail
[SPEAKER_02]: purchases, whether done in person or
online, start online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've done a lot of work focusing
on developing some online real estate that
[SPEAKER_02]: we think is gonna be valuable in the
future.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've asked for the funds to do two
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: One is micro cultivation and you've
suggested you need 360,000 Canadian on
[SPEAKER_07]: that end and the other is development of
the retail brand which I understand to be
[SPEAKER_07]: opening the retail stores, is that
correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the bulk of the spend is in the
application for the licenses and locking
[SPEAKER_02]: down locations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how many of this, for this part,
$576,000 you're seeking on the retail
[SPEAKER_07]: side, how many stores do you think you can
get open for that amount of money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on the market, whether we're
talking like small town or a city.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had to be pretty flexible.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've kind of been the way of the rabapus,
which is a rabbit octopus combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've been collecting low-hanging
fruit as it becomes available and trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to do what we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also depends on the licensing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put in applications for Saskatchewan,
but we didn't win the lottery there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of depends on which region,
which municipality, it's gonna change the
[SPEAKER_03]: cost.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you're actively engaged in seeking
retail spaces and making the applications
[SPEAKER_07]: where available and going out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have all the SOPs and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just have a comment that I wanna
congratulate you on your courage for
[SPEAKER_01]: making this pitch, because this is a part
of us coming out of the dark and into the
[SPEAKER_01]: light, and you guys are literally in
transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of a really brave,
awesome thing to do, to get up on the
[SPEAKER_01]: stage and talk about your preexisting
business and having the courage that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna help you hopefully find a way into
the fully licensed legal industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations on your courage and
thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Candice Dash Group, let's hear it for all
the competitors.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's hear it for the judges.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now the judges are gonna huddle up and
discuss everyone's flaws and shortcomings
[SPEAKER_09]: and strengths and abilities, and they're
gonna determine a winner.
[SPEAKER_09]: So play some music and we'll be ready.
One, two, three.
