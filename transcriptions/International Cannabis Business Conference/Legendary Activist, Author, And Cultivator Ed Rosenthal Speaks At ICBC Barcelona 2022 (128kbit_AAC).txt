[SPEAKER_01]: Before we go to lunch, we have a quick
special guest who wants to come out to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk for five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This man is an international legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's written for High Times Magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's published umpteen different books.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's a word in English
and Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many, many different books about cannabis
and the cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ganja Guru, The Wizard of Weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it for Ed Rosenfold!
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is he?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed!
[SPEAKER_01]: I told him!
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He came a long way too, all the way from
Oakland, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Berkeley, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like eight million years old now,
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should all aspire to be old
stoners, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old stoners, always more fun than old
drunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: No?
Alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you like to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's Ed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that his old column?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed Rosenfold!
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everybody!
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it great to be able to go to a
convention again?
[SPEAKER_00]: You thought that you were tired of them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When they ended, and now you realize
you're addicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, everything that the
government and the anti's said about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis turned out to be the reverse of
what they said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they said that cannabis leads to
dangerous drugs, and as I see it,
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana leads to hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, in New York City, where marijuana is
now legal to smoke anywhere you can smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: a cigarette, which means you can't smoke
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, in New York City, now, if you have a
prescription for opiates, right before it
[SPEAKER_00]: became legal and was only legal medically,
if you had a prescription for opiates you
[SPEAKER_00]: could get marijuana from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it turns out that opiates lead to
marijuana, and that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's only, you know, I was brought
in as a special speaker because they
[SPEAKER_00]: realized I was going to be in Barcelona
during these conventions, and they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really give me a subject to talk about,
but I want to talk about the most serious
[SPEAKER_00]: subject, and that is the people in prison
all over the world for marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: both here in Europe, in many states in the
United States, of course, in Asia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in the United States, while there are
people becoming billionaires from the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana trade, there are other people
languishing in prison for 20 years or
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing in Europe and France.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The police seem to be acting more
violently than they have in many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to get their last licks in,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, there's an opposition to
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Spain, police are acting perhaps
unconstitutionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there are humans suffering
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're here at this convention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a trade convention,
and we're doing business, and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: people languishing in prison just for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I'm not going to be talking about
how to cultivate today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can buy my book and learn
how to cultivate, but what we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn is compassion, and that each of us
in the trade, anybody who is making any
[SPEAKER_00]: commerce in it, has a personal obligation
to help get these people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are organizations, I'm not going
to go through all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an organization called Last
Prisoner Project, a very successful
[SPEAKER_00]: businessman, Steve D'Angelo, who also was
a Yippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing, and here in Europe,
there are any number of organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I'm imploring that everybody who's
here, you know, some people have money,
[SPEAKER_00]: other people have time, but it's one or
the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money or time, if you're involved in the
trade, you owe it to get out your brothers
[SPEAKER_00]: and sisters who are languishing in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed Rosenthal, very heartfelt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to remember that cannabis
legalization started as a social justice
[SPEAKER_01]: project before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a way for people to show up and try
to make millions of dollars being
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's always keep the spirit of social
justice and the spirit of freedom and the
[SPEAKER_01]: spirit of fairness in our hearts as we do
all this business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that said, let's go have lunch,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time.
