[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Ashley Elzner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the chief operating officer of artery
pay We are a digital payments company that
[SPEAKER_02]: unifies compliance with transaction so
that banks are very easily able to run
[SPEAKER_02]: their cannabis programs It's practically a
turnkey compliance program that is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually run off of technology with with
multiple lines of tracking and and
[SPEAKER_02]: transaction reporting so Allison cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Allison Koff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the founder and CEO of a company
called Artemis We are a software provider
[SPEAKER_01]: for the cannabis industry and our core
product is a cultivation management
[SPEAKER_01]: platform Helps automate all the people
plants processes and compliance that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got going on specifically built for
cultivators So we're not doing POS.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing all those other things But
we built it in an integratable way so you
[SPEAKER_05]: can tie into whatever systems you choose
to use and Actually, I guess each one to
[SPEAKER_02]: say where you're based Oh, sorry San Jose
and we we actually have operations in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, Massachusetts Nevada and
Washington for your finance thing What
[SPEAKER_05]: about you with your your stuff my stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're growing stuff We're based in
Brooklyn, New York, but we also have
[SPEAKER_01]: offices around the country as well as
North America And we're global so we're in
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe as well in Australia Well,
I guess if you have operating clients can
[SPEAKER_05]: you like she said the states where people
are using her software Where are people
[SPEAKER_01]: using your software almost every state?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we're also we have a we came
from the non-cannabis space first So we
[SPEAKER_01]: had been selling to Trish more traditional
operations And so we've got I think every
[SPEAKER_01]: state on the non-cannabis side and every
legal state on the cannabis side I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael Pavlak.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm out of Detroit, Michigan and we focus
on Seed to sell compliance software.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with stash stock is a company name We
really focus on the RFID aspect in the
[SPEAKER_03]: metric states making a no-touch solution
Where you don't have to touch your plants
[SPEAKER_03]: while you're moving them and having
real-time visibility into all of your
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation and processing concerns and I
was a grower for eight years before this
[SPEAKER_03]: and have 15 years of technology background
So trying to bridge my experience from
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation into technology and providing
that to licensed growers Amazing I'm Joel
[SPEAKER_04]: Sherlock Vancouver based I think spend a
250 days on the road we Have a
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturing business one of the leading
manufacturers of the extraction machines
[SPEAKER_04]: that power a lot of these great people
making oil products So we make co2 and
[SPEAKER_04]: ethanol ethanol equipment and much like a
lot of people on the stage with me We are
[SPEAKER_04]: global and four continents and offices on
three Great, and I'll give you some
[SPEAKER_05]: context on me.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Justin Hall My ticket to this
party is that I registered bud.com 26
[SPEAKER_05]: years ago, and I know my way around a web
browser so I I'm the CTO bud.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do e-commerce for cannabis and hemp Pre
rolls and for CBD wellness products.
[SPEAKER_05]: We serve California with our cannabis THC
products and then we ship around the world
[SPEAKER_05]: people like stuff like weed so I think
what's really interesting is that if you
[SPEAKER_05]: look at each of you You would have
different visibility into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would have visibility into payment
streams You would have you too would have
[SPEAKER_05]: visibility into growth growth trends and
you would have visibility Into how people
[SPEAKER_05]: are extracting cannabis and where people
there's demand for your software.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's there's the growth of the industry
So I wonder if one of you wants to wade in
[SPEAKER_05]: and and and take what I just said as a
prompt to promote the thing that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: working on Because that's what panels are
so bring it on Sure, so what artery pay
[SPEAKER_02]: does is actually offers a completely legal
payment solution my background is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: financial institution law and Operations
and that's financial institution
[SPEAKER_02]: operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how the software Sausage is in fact
made the back office stuff and one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things that we were able to do actually
because of my background is to build the
[SPEAKER_02]: MRB FinCEN compliance requirements and I'm
going to tell what those acronyms are
[SPEAKER_02]: because we talked about this right before
So MRB means marijuana business and that
[SPEAKER_02]: is a class of a regulatory classification
by the financial crimes enforcement part
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Treasury Department with the
federal government everybody is required
[SPEAKER_02]: to follow these regulations if they want
to work with the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it can be pretty cumbersome for Banks
to actually be able to engage with the
[SPEAKER_02]: space based on this the added cost and so
we built it into the transaction system to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that that cost was not the
reason why a Bank that was interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: working with the cannabis space Could not
work with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not a legal issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, it is very much a cost-benefit
analysis that they go through and so we
[SPEAKER_02]: bring that cost down to a very very low
reasonable rate for them and make training
[SPEAKER_02]: much more efficient much easier and
provide a platform to them that allows us
[SPEAKER_02]: to actually access the financial systems
Openly and with these partners rather than
[SPEAKER_02]: you know trying to sneak in or saying that
it's a workaround You don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: workarounds in finance.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is absolutely it you're basically
between cannabis and finance you have one
[SPEAKER_02]: highlight highly regulated industry and
another highly regulated industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just piling regulations on top of
each other and the interplay of those
[SPEAKER_02]: things end up causing a Lot of
complications and that's really what's
[SPEAKER_02]: causing the issues around lack of access
And so we are bringing in new banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are onboarding them all the time and we
are able to provide them with the systems
[SPEAKER_02]: that make it possible for us to write
provide you with completely legal
[SPEAKER_02]: completely transparent payments on a
digital platform, so also highly
[SPEAKER_02]: integratable where we are agnostic as to
As to other software's that you would be
[SPEAKER_02]: using so it's a very easy to use your
customers can download the app and
[SPEAKER_02]: actually go in and pay you in-store very
very simple and it works Multi-channel so
[SPEAKER_02]: online on the go in-store doesn't matter
where you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use this Okay, so that's so and
you would have visibility into the
[SPEAKER_05]: financial growth and so can you pluck
something off the top?
[SPEAKER_05]: Your head that's interesting that you've
seen about the financial patterns of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry using artery sure so
dispensaries are still primarily using
[SPEAKER_02]: cash or in some places they are
Unfortunately using things that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not actually allowed to use they probably
don't know that credit cards is illegal
[SPEAKER_02]: for this industry period stop halt like in
the United States now there's a These are
[SPEAKER_02]: all United States specific issues because
the financial regulations are United
[SPEAKER_02]: States specific so from our perspective
you're seeing a lot of You're seeing a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people who maybe don't have the
background coming into the space and
[SPEAKER_02]: selling products that they're not allowed
to sell into the space So really having
[SPEAKER_02]: someone with an operating background in
finance is is kind of critically important
[SPEAKER_02]: to making sure that you don't have that
sort of problem And of course when that
[SPEAKER_02]: happens We see a lot of bank shutdowns we
see I think almost everybody who's in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis space has experienced Something
where they've ended up through no fault of
[SPEAKER_02]: their own having their bank accounts
revoked and so we see a lot of that Okay
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds like accurate data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Sure, I mean like Michael I was also
on the growing side before this and and
[SPEAKER_01]: worked as an operator and so The thing
that I think I'm most passionate about in
[SPEAKER_01]: this space is solving the issues around
Technology scale and usability and how do
[SPEAKER_01]: you get people to actually love using
technology?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which isn't as easy as it sounds this is
new technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got security issues We've got
scaling issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got Offline access issues where you
have remote areas for hemp specifically in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular where you've got a lot of field
Accessibility issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a large migrant population
working in the fields when you're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about outdoor You're talking about farm
workers who move from one facility to
[SPEAKER_01]: another often So you've got traceability
issues and lack of transparency when data
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves one facility Because you have
workers leaving you've got illiteracy
[SPEAKER_01]: issues amongst workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got language barriers You've got
these the slew of challenges that make
[SPEAKER_01]: solving technology issues in this space
really really interesting and really hard
[SPEAKER_01]: and so the approach that we took as a
technology company was what can we solve
[SPEAKER_01]: for growers that I knew to be a major
issue because it was something I would
[SPEAKER_01]: have paid for as an operator but also
Starting with the things that are sticky
[SPEAKER_01]: enough that get you into a system until
you lose Love it and then layer on the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that you really really need sort of
thereafter right and so instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: starting from Maybe the the regulation
side where a lot of the other companies
[SPEAKER_01]: started where they said hey here's a huge
business opportunity, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can build regulated regulatory
software.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can link in we can trace We can get
governments to the point where they can
[SPEAKER_01]: track products so that they can tax
against it Which is fine great business
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said well, you know what you're doing
there though is you're creating regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: software You're not creating growers
software And so we said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to build software that people can
use on a day-to-day basis So start with
[SPEAKER_01]: tracking plants in a way that is a
production value to me So give me crop
[SPEAKER_01]: scheduling give me estimates on yield Give
me how many workers I'm gonna need today
[SPEAKER_01]: tomorrow next week six months from now
Give me the ability to do purchase orders
[SPEAKER_01]: But not from a regulatory standpoint give
it to me from a forecasting standpoint So
[SPEAKER_01]: I know if I'm running low on something I'm
not gonna run out of it and I can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: send that with a one-click to my vendors
or on the sales side is Instead of saying
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a POS just so that I can track it
again from a financial or regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint Give it to me so that I can do
sales order so I can forecast and see sell
[SPEAKER_01]: through rates of my products and start to
adjust my Production schedules based off
[SPEAKER_01]: what's actually selling in the market
those types of insights that to me make me
[SPEAKER_01]: or cost me a lot of money and we started
there and we started layering on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: that so that we could be in all the metric
states right have a seamless metric
[SPEAKER_01]: integration try and replace the experience
with bad things that people don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: doing with good things that they Really
love doing because it's a tool for me and
[SPEAKER_01]: my operation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that sounds like great tool So any
data nuggets that you would pluck from
[SPEAKER_05]: your tool rollout data nuggets
Observations across the data landscape
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the the tip I always give
I'll give this because I've seen it a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of times is that when you're
evaluating things think about the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can replace pen and paper first
Because they're things that you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to do because you're doing them
on a day-by-day basis so if you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: You're around your facility and you're
like, oh, yeah, I'm recording pH on my and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a log on my wall Can you put that
in a software system or can you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: those things first because the more things
you can replace that are very manual One
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just gonna immediately have an ROI
and two it's gonna be tracing that
[SPEAKER_01]: information So that if Joe who's tracking
pH leaves you actually have a system and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what the pH was three weeks ago
and so like those types of things I think
[SPEAKER_01]: the the number one mistake we make all the
time is when we're evaluating technology
[SPEAKER_01]: we get sucked into what features are cool
What the newest thing is I want to have AI
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything right like all these things
that are sexy in technology But the
[SPEAKER_01]: reality is the thing you're gonna use
every day replaces something that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: already doing Yeah, I think a lot of you
know what Allison is saying is same for us
[SPEAKER_03]: but one of the things that we really look
at is Scale so as a company, let's say we
[SPEAKER_03]: deal with someone who can grow 10,000
plants But they want to get familiar with
[SPEAKER_03]: it first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're gonna start with 500 And
they're very successful at 500 now they go
[SPEAKER_03]: up to a 2,000 at 2,000 now they're
struggling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does that happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have a technology in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have something that's gonna
make that economy of scale of compliance
[SPEAKER_03]: and drive that cost down So right now a
lot of operators actually as you scale
[SPEAKER_03]: your cost is going up Around compliance
because you have more people you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: train these people The first person maybe
does a really good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second person maybe does a decent job
third fourth fifth Person you're training.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just more and more effort to make
sure that they're doing that same good job
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we bring a technology in and say
that one person can do?
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole scale or two people can manage
it instead of five or ten So that's one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the things we really focus on is a
scalability of cultivators to not have a
[SPEAKER_03]: burden of manual effort around compliance
Utilize the technology to automatically
[SPEAKER_03]: capture and record things accurately
Quickly, you don't have to hire these
[SPEAKER_03]: people and then using technology You're
not interacting with your plants as much
[SPEAKER_03]: your contamination risk is going down So
you're getting a bigger yield at the end
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're not having to waste as much
stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: so those are the things that we're looking
at in in terms of technology and Again
[SPEAKER_03]: replacing some of these manual process so
that that time just goes away and and
[SPEAKER_05]: you've people are using your software
Hallelujah, they're saving time and what
[SPEAKER_05]: what have you gleaned from watching the
way people use your software?
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the things that that we struggle
with is Operators that have been doing it
[SPEAKER_03]: manually and they look at the technology
instantly it resonates like oh my god
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna save me all this effort but
when we talk to startups or Facilities
[SPEAKER_03]: that are just getting rolling they believe
they're not gonna make any mistakes and
[SPEAKER_03]: they believe that the process in place is
gonna be followed perfectly by every
[SPEAKER_03]: employee and inevitably it's not and We
see a lot of times people will call us
[SPEAKER_03]: like oh my god I moved 500 plants and I'd
lost three of them or whatever it took me
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 hours to track those three down Well
using the technology we can find those
[SPEAKER_03]: plants in about five minutes So you're
talking about hours of effort versus
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes on mistakes and people don't want
to talk about mistakes They happen all the
[SPEAKER_03]: freaking time and you have to account for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to mitigate those risks because one
mistake can cost you Tons of man hours if
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't have a good process in place The
one that the token hardware guy just token
[SPEAKER_04]: hardware guys well I think a lot of people
look at data and technology kind of you
[SPEAKER_04]: know as Okay can speed things up but may
be able to save me some time But a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people miss the fact that I think one of
the only guarantees we have in this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry is change and it changes quickly
so that investment in data You know that
[SPEAKER_04]: investment in in having those systems so
that as you're changing you have better
[SPEAKER_04]: data to go back on I mean we're focused
kind of after you guys have done your all
[SPEAKER_04]: the great work and then product is dried,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're focused on extracting it But you
know There's gonna be change in a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: the products that our clients would be
making a year from now or just being
[SPEAKER_04]: thought of or dreamt up right now So,
you know flexibility in that
[SPEAKER_04]: infrastructure, but ultimately it's led by
the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you grow more?
[SPEAKER_04]: THCP or you know any CBG CBN whatever it
is like we can only extract up to 100% of
[SPEAKER_04]: what's grown no more We haven't figured
that part out yet But you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's that side of you know going back to
that data as the products change to figure
[SPEAKER_04]: out Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what did we do in that one grow run
where we saw a spike in this thing that
[SPEAKER_05]: we're now looking for Okay, you just ended
your remarks there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that I've chatted with this
gentleman before it was today So the
[SPEAKER_05]: information is fresh the company he's
worked for has made many of these machines
[SPEAKER_05]: that extract Cannabis oil that can be used
then to make other products So those the
[SPEAKER_05]: machines that your company's made are
distributed around the world into
[SPEAKER_05]: different countries So and you got to have
some interesting data on how extractions
[SPEAKER_05]: going over here versus over there or
something Well, I think yeah, I mean we
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely see there's lots to be learned,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a ton of mistakes that have
been made but so many people are not open
[SPEAKER_04]: to really understanding I mean in the
early days of the Canadian, you know The
[SPEAKER_04]: funded capacity giant greenhouses and then
they were like, oh we can't learn anything
[SPEAKER_04]: from the guys from California It's like
someone making half a million vape
[SPEAKER_04]: cartridges a month is gonna have the same
bottlenecks that you're gonna have when
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada Maybe one day gets to that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully You know, we're starting to see
a lot of growth in big pharma companies
[SPEAKER_04]: stepping in in the EU Ecosystem it's all
EUGMP, which is a pharma level.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's significant significantly higher
barrier to entry once you get past like
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation can be done in GACP like
Forming practices, but EUGMP or good
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturing practices is Extremely,
you know lots of documentation track
[SPEAKER_04]: everything each piece of equipment that
touches the oil has to be You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to know where the steel came
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you clean it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's it's really really comprehensive
So, you know, but they don't have cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: experience at the level that we do so,
you know, I think ultimately You can you
[SPEAKER_04]: can learn something from every single
market and you can learn from other
[SPEAKER_05]: people's mistakes Yes, and mistakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a segue to the next question Which
is if you make mistakes you poison people
[SPEAKER_05]: if you guys make with your company So if
you guys make mistakes people lose their
[SPEAKER_05]: crops or grow the wrong thing or may
poison people too If you screw up people
[SPEAKER_05]: could be accused of money laundering and
go to jail If I screw up people get the
[SPEAKER_05]: you know get the wrong get get a hybrid
instead of a satire A vape cart delivered
[SPEAKER_05]: to their house.
[SPEAKER_05]: So so let's talk here But if you guys are
looking at what failure is how does
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody evaluating your solution decide
that you're trustworthy?
[SPEAKER_02]: When the stakes are high So you have to
look at people's backgrounds if you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: focused on people's backgrounds and you
can't find out who's running a company or
[SPEAKER_02]: they say they're in quotation marks an ISO
which stands for independent sales
[SPEAKER_02]: organization You've got to know that
anybody who is just sales Probably doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really know what's going on in the back
And can't really explain what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to be doing and what you're not
and you know the best way to Evaluate some
[SPEAKER_02]: vendors and I hate to say this because it
sounds like I'm you know plugging lawyers
[SPEAKER_02]: But get your corporate lawyers involved If
anybody is going to be able to evaluate
[SPEAKER_02]: whether this is going to actually pass
muster They're going to be able to do so
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's a little bit tricky
because from the financial services space
[SPEAKER_02]: actually the best financial institution
lawyers They're all in New York City.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it just happens that that is like
our core the core location So if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: people who are coming from that kind of a
background that really have Have been
[SPEAKER_02]: focused on the financial space in New York
City.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's really good credentials.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really outstanding For you know
somebody who is coming in and is you know
[SPEAKER_02]: a relationship manager They may or may not
know what they're talking about and so
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes down to it You really want
to dig into what they're doing and if
[SPEAKER_02]: after you've signed a nondisclosure
agreement with people They're still not
[SPEAKER_02]: willing to tell you who the financial
institutions are that are backing them and
[SPEAKER_02]: that are working with them That's a huge
red flag another huge red flag in this
[SPEAKER_02]: space specific to specific to cannabis
regulation financial regulation on that is
[SPEAKER_02]: when someone Is calling an MRB a CRB
because they're trying to rebrand a
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory category and that is not kosher
that is not kosher at all you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: wonder whether these people are actually
focused on what's best for you or if
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just You know going ahead and
selling you something that either you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't need or isn't sustainable And that's
another focus like you really have to dig
[SPEAKER_02]: into this because you are heavily
regulated and on the financial side
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately mistakes are not forgiven
Yeah, I mean you're not only innovating
[SPEAKER_05]: tech you're innovating finance and if you
innovate finance too much They kind of you
[SPEAKER_05]: might go to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah Yeah, if you do it wrong you go
to prison and so does everybody in the
[SPEAKER_02]: supply chain that's involved with you and
so do your customers because actually The
[SPEAKER_02]: racketeering statutes in the that are
federal federal government racketeering
[SPEAKER_02]: statutes Get everybody on quote conspiracy
to money launder So if you don't know how
[SPEAKER_02]: they work in the back how they're actually
Getting something done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get somebody who can dig in on
that and listen your lawyers can help This
[SPEAKER_02]: is what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do the research.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their job is to research this stuff
for you and give you counsel and You know
[SPEAKER_02]: if they're working with you in cannabis,
they're gonna have no problem with
[SPEAKER_02]: finance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean It's it's not hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not hard lawyers love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do they love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They love you You make a lot of good work
for them and it's fun and good money for
[SPEAKER_02]: them I think I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean like you will feel when you're
vetting companies Like just make sure you
[SPEAKER_01]: vet the company well But you feel it right
and so like if you're looking at a
[SPEAKER_01]: software company go to their website Look
at their team, right if they don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: software engineers on the team They're not
gonna if it's an outsource software
[SPEAKER_01]: engineering team You're gonna have a hack
or a break or a downage in four minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: like it just is gonna happen because if
you're not building the Team internally
[SPEAKER_01]: like you have no control over that
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure that the if it's a software
Company make sure they have software
[SPEAKER_01]: engineers on the team If you want to dig
even further go to LinkedIn right and see
[SPEAKER_01]: the background of those people if they
have three engineers And they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: recent boot camp grads like you're gonna
have what happened with shadow Like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just gonna happen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is this is what happens if you
don't have control over your internal team
[SPEAKER_01]: And like that's nothing against those
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel bad that that was their first job
But it happens like if you're a young
[SPEAKER_01]: engineer, it's those things are gonna
happen So make sure that it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced team make sure that they have
a CTO that actually has experience
[SPEAKER_01]: building companies You can vet that kind
of thing Make sure you can see who backs
[SPEAKER_01]: them financially, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have money in the bank?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they gonna be around longer than you
are?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure that they're gonna
be around So even if it's venture-backed
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that they have the right sort of
structure behind it and that they disclose
[SPEAKER_01]: Call their customers get case studies like
call customers do it When you put an
[SPEAKER_01]: inbound phone call in I did I tested this
the other day with some of our competitors
[SPEAKER_01]: I had fun with it, but like put an Inbound
request and see how long it takes for them
[SPEAKER_01]: to respond to you if it takes two and a
half weeks And you still haven't heard
[SPEAKER_01]: anything Like those are the types of
things that make a good company in any
[SPEAKER_01]: industry whether it's cannabis or not and
so do the like vet the company a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit and and make sure that they're a good
partner for you because at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: day in cannabis specifically It's it's a
multi-choice, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The market is changing drastically
regulation changes the financial markets
[SPEAKER_01]: are changing We have elections coming up
who knows what will happen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this stuff is really hard for us in
addition to that The fact that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to build a business which is also
really hard And so make sure that you find
[SPEAKER_01]: a good partner that you gel with make sure
they can speak the same language You can
[SPEAKER_01]: you know your business is better than that
vendor will ever know it But if they catch
[SPEAKER_01]: on if they're interested if their founders
are coming out to your site to see what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on Because they're just curious like
that's probably gonna be a better partner
[SPEAKER_01]: for you than somebody who you can't get
service access to at any point I Agree
[SPEAKER_03]: with everything that they're saying but
you know my company Actually is a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit newer to the industry But one of the
things that we do, you know, we're always
[SPEAKER_03]: on site You can contact us directly We're
technology Background so the entire team
[SPEAKER_03]: is all software all the time and we
partner with large-scale technology
[SPEAKER_03]: providers that do some pretty massive
websites and technology deployments but
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, one of the things for us is like a
lot of our competitors are gonna install
[SPEAKER_03]: software and hardware in your facility
that you're gonna have to manage and make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure it has proper security and You know
that no one's able to get into that box
[SPEAKER_03]: Versus you know, everything is cloud for
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're managing on top of Azure We have
all of the built-in securities from a
[SPEAKER_03]: cloud provider We don't have to worry
about you know, someone hacking your local
[SPEAKER_03]: computer that you put password as the
password And stuff like that so,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, how much are we taking?
[SPEAKER_03]: off of your plate from a risk standpoint
What technologies are we using?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is our background?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all great questions Surprisingly
people ask us for referrals all the time
[SPEAKER_03]: and I thought that was strange at first
But I love when people ask me that because
[SPEAKER_03]: I can give them our clients that have
moved off of other technologies I can say,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, who are you evaluating right
now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I might have someone that actually was a
customer and switched and they can talk to
[SPEAKER_03]: you about the experience and we'll just
connect you directly Like it's not like
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm speaking on their behalf Call them
talk to them directly get a few of them
[SPEAKER_03]: and see what they have to say We you know,
that's really the best way I think a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people get sucked into contracts before
they're actually ready for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other thing I would say is Be
flexible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get into bed with anyone too soon We
have free offers so you can use all of our
[SPEAKER_03]: technology for free for an entire growth
cycle so you can evaluate it locally see
[SPEAKER_03]: if it actually makes sense For you before
you pay anything so You know, we touched
[SPEAKER_04]: on a lot of big things people
testimonials, you know I think data for
[SPEAKER_04]: sure like there are a lot of big claims
and maybe some unproven claims in the
[SPEAKER_04]: canvas market So just get people to back
it up, you know, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's that's a big claim Show me,
you know, there's a lot of data available
[SPEAKER_04]: to I mean, there's multi-state operators
who have multiple locations, you know if
[SPEAKER_04]: You know if somebody buys in our world,
right if the best thing that Someone could
[SPEAKER_04]: do for us is you know, once they were on
another platform They come over to a
[SPEAKER_04]: vitalis extraction machine and then every
expansion going forward that person's
[SPEAKER_04]: putting in more equipment, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that's an investment in this
partnership, you know But but look at who
[SPEAKER_04]: are they working with and are those people
continuing to work with them?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's that's usually a very
strong endorsement, but you know get those
[SPEAKER_04]: testimonials talk to their customers
figure out where they good how's their
[SPEAKER_04]: service team because things change
problems come up things Break and and you
[SPEAKER_04]: want somebody who's gonna be there to to
support you Speak here is easy to you
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can just go look at it Like
that's a nice thing like go look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: hardware.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah touch it see it So speaking of
someone there to support you let's find a
[SPEAKER_05]: question in the audience Does anyone have
any questions somebody has a question
[SPEAKER_03]: someone's got to have one question,
you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you introduce yourself and say what
you're working on And I have to say so far
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been a little bit of a struggle to
attract tech candidates Here in the Bay
[SPEAKER_00]: Area it's problem in general, but then you
add on Cannabis and I think that scares
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the tech candidates away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to hear how you've built out
that tech team Question is how do you
[SPEAKER_05]: build out a tech team when some of the
tech candidates are scared off by
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a caper flick, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go from scene to scene I would
say talk about mission Larry like one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that we do above all at our
company is we Created a set of core values
[SPEAKER_01]: that are important to us and how we
operate As a business and we leverage that
[SPEAKER_01]: every single time we're hiring,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we we push out our core values
everywhere and we talk about them as often
[SPEAKER_01]: as we can and we interview against them
and we just sort of embrace this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we have a mission as a company
we care deeply about it and yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course we want to make money for our
shareholders and everything like that that
[SPEAKER_01]: comes with running a business but like at
the heart of it the why we do it is just
[SPEAKER_01]: as important and How we operate often
falls in Canon to the why we do it and
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're gonna find people I mean
there's a room full of people here who are
[SPEAKER_01]: Interested in the cannabis industry,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the Bay Area So presumably some
of these people may be looking for jobs if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like she's looking for engineers
Yeah, well if you're an engineer in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room looking for a job, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But like people in South Bay who would
totally yeah Yeah, it's like people are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be passionate about packaging you
need to party more at the right at the
[SPEAKER_01]: right parties But but talk about the the
why you're doing it because the more often
[SPEAKER_01]: that you talk about the why and not just
like hey We're hiring and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: compete on salary in the Bay Area because
everybody's paying You know $120,000 for a
[SPEAKER_01]: new entry engineer like instead of talking
about things that are hard for engineers
[SPEAKER_01]: to be attracted to if you're only Selling
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And why are you doing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we operate as a company and
you're selling yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly is like the founder right and then
I'm gonna be as a candidate really
[SPEAKER_01]: attracted to what that's really
interesting Maybe I wasn't super
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate about packaging, but I love
cannabis and so we can find a way to work
[SPEAKER_01]: together Or I'm really passionate about
both of those things and you'll get those
[SPEAKER_02]: people So, are you a solo?
[SPEAKER_02]: entrepreneur Yeah So that's one of the
things that yeah, that's one of the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that is actually Difficult solo
entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not actually about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's solo entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a difficult time attracting teams
So if you can find a co-founder who is you
[SPEAKER_02]: know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you're the technical
person or you're looking for a technical
[SPEAKER_02]: person to be the co-founder I think that
you will have a Easier time pulling in
[SPEAKER_02]: engineers because a lot of times once you
have a technical founder They actually
[SPEAKER_02]: have teams that they've worked with before
that just love working with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what I did I actually went
out and found my extremely well seasoned
[SPEAKER_02]: hardened like old-school IBM er who
designed, you know anti money laundering
[SPEAKER_02]: software for the FBI and the Department of
Defense and designed transaction systems
[SPEAKER_02]: for for you know Wells Fargo and Bank of
America and he was you know hanging out at
[SPEAKER_02]: fintechs a fintech Meetups and things like
that and so in the Bay Area meetups can be
[SPEAKER_02]: a powerful tool for you actually to find
People who have those those core interests
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know almost everybody in the Bay
has fantastic chops in terms of like
[SPEAKER_02]: engineering and computer science So going
to those places and having a co-founder
[SPEAKER_02]: with you so that they see that it's not
just you so it doesn't feel like they're
[SPEAKER_05]: taking as much of a You may have to go to
that party to meet the co-founder though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's exactly what I did Just
advocating exactly what I did and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, it's it's again Like you say the
passion has to be there the the underlying
[SPEAKER_02]: story for why you're doing this has to be
there It has to be really important and
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to be talking about grander
vision But it's one of those things that's
[SPEAKER_02]: that is much easier for people to get
around when they start seeing Multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are on your team.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, oh, this is real Over and
out of time, I'm so sorry one two three
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Take it cannabis
