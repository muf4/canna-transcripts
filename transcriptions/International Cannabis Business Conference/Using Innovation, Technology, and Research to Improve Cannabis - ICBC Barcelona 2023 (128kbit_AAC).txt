[SPEAKER_05]: More exhibits upstairs, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Support our sponsors.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd like to thank iSpyre for being the
title sponsor for this year's conference
[SPEAKER_05]: here in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to bring up the next set
of panelists.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to discuss using innovation,
technology, and research to improve
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here to lead this panel is the manager
of Cannabis Hub.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it for Natalia Lavi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you're having a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a wonderful time today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, ICBC, for having us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's welcome Ruben Valenzuela,
CEO from Valen Veras and founder of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Hub within the UPC, the
Polytechnic University of Catalonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bozidar Radicic.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the project manager and founder from
Research Nature Institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have Carlos Ferreiro Vera.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the CEO of Fito Plant Research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have Juan Chorrives.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the business developer from Aptus
Planttec.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will be talking about how we use
innovation, technology, and research to
[SPEAKER_02]: improve cannabis, harnessing science and
ingenuity to move the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_02]: forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first question is, what are the
main current challenges of the sector in
[SPEAKER_02]: Spain?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are the challenges that your
companies and institutions like Aptus,
[SPEAKER_02]: Valen Veras, Research Nature Institute,
and Fito Plant has as a company according
[SPEAKER_02]: to their particular activities?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ruben, would you like to start?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, everyone, to be here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's a pleasure now to have a chance
to show what we are having here in Spain.
[SPEAKER_10]: And basically what we really have a
problem with the MEPs.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's the urgency that it's complicated
to do the research up to an urgency that
[SPEAKER_10]: let us be really restrictive with all the
documentation.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really slow.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not as easy in any other country,
especially like, for example, Portugal.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would say that the problem that we
have is that we would like to improve that
[SPEAKER_10]: and see how we could unify forces to
research together without that limitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I agree as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot speak for Spain, but
internationally it's very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to exchange, let's say,
samples between the laboratories or other
[SPEAKER_01]: things because even if there is a small
amount or even standards for a laboratory,
[SPEAKER_01]: they consider it as illegal drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this should be changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was also an initiative from Israel,
from Lumir Hanush, because we should be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to cooperate worldwide.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to add something.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, FITOPLAN was one of the first
companies researching in Europe.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's something special.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got lucky time ago to be able to
research on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: But right now, compared with Portugal,
as Juancho was saying, infrared just can't
[SPEAKER_10]: give you an answer in one, two weeks.
[SPEAKER_10]: EMEPS could take four to six months.
[SPEAKER_10]: So how you're going to research in our
industry having that long time of reply.
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, seeing this, the next question is
then how are you making use of ingenuity
[SPEAKER_02]: to push these limits currently?
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, actually from the cannabis hub,
we saw that we have a lack of regulation
[SPEAKER_10]: into the hemp inside Spain.
[SPEAKER_10]: France is really increasing their
production.
[SPEAKER_10]: They already have more than 18,000
hectares of crop.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't have any decorticator in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we were looking why we have that
problem in Spain and what is going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_10]: We cannot extract.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we cannot extract.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once we grow even seeds of fiber,
the biomass cannot be used for extraction.
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually farmers, they send it to Germany
or France or any other place that they
[SPEAKER_10]: could extract.
[SPEAKER_10]: Furthermore, we have all that issues with
some varieties done in our climate.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are not really producing what we
expect.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that we have that limitation on 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_10]: We came with the idea inside the cannabis
hub to present the P&L.
[SPEAKER_10]: Bernardo proposed it before.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we were showing a bit how we could
press the government that they don't need
[SPEAKER_10]: to change the law.
[SPEAKER_10]: They just need to have a different view
about the hemp and how we could be
[SPEAKER_10]: competent related with other countries.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we are doing, we are just
presenting a P&L.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a proposal, no law, to change that
rules inside the hemp and being able to be
[SPEAKER_10]: really productive here and have a chance
to revolutionize the hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what we are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are also now somehow organizing
cannabis hub in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or actually, we want to connect all the
players in Slovenia for a quicker and
[SPEAKER_01]: better growth of cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But indeed, this field is also important
education and quick response or transfer
[SPEAKER_01]: the knowledge from the research facilities
to the industry so all the stakeholders
[SPEAKER_01]: can benefit from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all these things are too much
dispersed and we have to somehow bring
[SPEAKER_01]: them together for the benefit of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: From my point of view, trying to find
solutions to these issues is a little bit
[SPEAKER_09]: complicated, especially if we try to do
something alone.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for me, the key for solving these
problems is the collaboration.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you know the stress lies in the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for this reason, FITPLAN collaborate
with different associations, ACPMs in USA,
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis hub here in Catalonia.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have created ICAME, the first
association of companies with
[SPEAKER_09]: authorization by the MPS for production or
for scientific purposes.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think that the key is the
collaboration and the change the culture.
[SPEAKER_09]: From my personal point of view,
to change something is by the education.
[SPEAKER_09]: For that reason, here in Catalonia,
in the University of Catalonia,
[SPEAKER_09]: we have created the first master degree.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not exactly a master, it's a post-graduate
course where we try to educate the new
[SPEAKER_09]: generation about the benefits of the plant
and how using the very strict law that we
[SPEAKER_09]: have here is possible, work correctly with
the plant in all the possibilities that
[SPEAKER_09]: this amazing plant has.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: One person alone is not strong enough in
this case.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we're together, we're going to be
stronger.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these days, for instance, these last
two days that we've been at the cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: hub working, you come up with a lot of
ideas and ways to work to try to convince
[SPEAKER_08]: the politicians that are at the end,
the ones that have to do something about
[SPEAKER_08]: this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is why I think that the cannabis
hub is really, really important in these
[SPEAKER_08]: cases for us to be stronger and get to
know each other better.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's why I think it's
important for us to work together to get
[SPEAKER_08]: to reach one point together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, apart from this, some people might
think, how are you able to collaborate
[SPEAKER_02]: when some of you are even competitors?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next question is, what's the
benefit of collaborating when you are
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes competitors?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how does this improve or boost the
development of more competitive and
[SPEAKER_02]: innovative products?
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, in my case, I think that the
problem that Fetoplan has are common of
[SPEAKER_09]: the rest of the company.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I repeat again the same answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: The stress lies in the numbers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I try to do something alone,
maybe I have the capacity to change
[SPEAKER_09]: something.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we collaborate with somebody,
especially experts in this sector,
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe we can find a new solution,
a new idea, a new channel of communication
[SPEAKER_09]: with the agency, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, the collaboration, I think that
is the key.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I found something interesting for us,
it's interesting for my competitor,
[SPEAKER_09]: but everybody wins at the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think that collaborating with a
competitor can provide access to data,
[SPEAKER_08]: analytics, and trends.
[SPEAKER_08]: And new resources that are mutually
beneficial, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Working together can help identify sales
opportunities and promote cross-selling.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even though sometimes we are
competitors in the same sector,
[SPEAKER_08]: as I said before, I think in some cases,
we have to be together.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to be together because we have,
in this case, we have the same interests
[SPEAKER_08]: as some of the companies that are in the
hub, or similar interests.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically, it's to convince the
politicians to let us work.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is what we have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we will stand together, then,
as mentioned, we will have, or we can make
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger pressure to the decision makers to
change the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sharing this experience and the
knowledge between the companies and the
[SPEAKER_01]: research facilities will definitely lead
to a faster growing industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we will hide from each other,
then on the end, nobody will benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned before, connect
industry and science and transfer the
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge to the industry as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have big challenges now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis can replace so many things from
the insulation to it's not just so-called
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational or medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much other things we can get from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that why we're not going to
collaborate with a competitor when we are
[SPEAKER_10]: in a really young industry is the forest.
[SPEAKER_10]: There isn't any tree there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are growing few trees.
[SPEAKER_10]: But still, it's all to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you think about your competitor,
I think it could be your friend in many of
[SPEAKER_10]: the parts.
[SPEAKER_10]: And for sure, we're going to have our own
private things.
[SPEAKER_10]: But there is an example.
[SPEAKER_10]: Within the cannabis hub, we saw an
opportunity to develop an NIR technology
[SPEAKER_10]: that could evaluate the many different
characters from hemp, from fiber,
[SPEAKER_10]: from seeds, from flowers.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then instead of being fighting between
us, we just collaborate.
[SPEAKER_10]: And together, we develop that technology
that at the end is going to give benefits
[SPEAKER_10]: to all the companies.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's so young, the industry,
that we still have a lot of collaborations
[SPEAKER_10]: to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, there are other big
companies that have more power that if we
[SPEAKER_10]: don't play together, they are going to
play the game.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think there's a good chance right now
to have other collaborations.
[SPEAKER_10]: And being together in that hub,
I think, is a really good opportunity to
[SPEAKER_10]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's move forward with what are the
latest innovations that you're developing
[SPEAKER_02]: in your businesses and institutions?
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: In FITOPLAN, all the time we are
generating new genetics, of course,
[SPEAKER_09]: because we are genetics, as well as
different kind of methods to extract or
[SPEAKER_09]: purify compounds in order to license this
knowledge to our customer.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're asking about the last or the
most important one?
[SPEAKER_02]: The latest things you've been doing that
you would like to share, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: that are relevant to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there are a lot of information
during 11 years into the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're more passionate about.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have many things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe the most important one, or the last
one, was the five scientific papers that
[SPEAKER_09]: we published last year.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk in these studies about the new
technology, not new technology,
[SPEAKER_09]: new possibility to the micropropagation
systems using in vitro cultures.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have evaluated different molecules
asking us what happened about the manager
[SPEAKER_09]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have discovered that some of these
molecules accelerate the metabolism and
[SPEAKER_09]: increase the concentration of some
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: After that, we have published a review
where we evaluate old data and the public
[SPEAKER_09]: data and patents about the extraction and
purification mission.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have also published a study where
we evaluate the pharmacokinetic methods in
[SPEAKER_09]: order to offer something from an
industrial point of view to the society.
[SPEAKER_09]: After that, we have created a
collaboration with the veterinary hospital
[SPEAKER_09]: of the University of Cordoba, where we
evaluate the pharmacokinetic methods in
[SPEAKER_09]: order to offer something from an
industrial point of view to the society.
[SPEAKER_09]: And finally, we have published a study of
CBT in two different pathways and
[SPEAKER_09]: administration bias.
[SPEAKER_09]: And finally, we have published something
about the quality control, where we
[SPEAKER_09]: evaluate the effect of the temperature.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is something very relevant
because in the last table, the participant
[SPEAKER_09]: mentioned that in some cases, the analysis
are a little bit different between the
[SPEAKER_09]: labs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And sometimes in this publication,
we show how the temperature affects to the
[SPEAKER_09]: results and maybe modify the quantity of
the DNA.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the cultivars could be a very high
problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that this is a good summary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of work.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are so proud that we are going to
launch during this week our new NIR system
[SPEAKER_10]: that could analyze cannabinoids in less
than one minute.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know a bit about the technology.
[SPEAKER_10]: We saw other companies that have been
playing with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we are really lucky.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got a really good collaboration with
Seaward, a company from the United States,
[SPEAKER_10]: that provide together with us and within
the hub many other companies, Breeders and
[SPEAKER_10]: Fetix, that help us develop that system.
[SPEAKER_10]: After four years, we are going to launch
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I welcome everyone to come to Overstand
and see that technology that I'm so proud
[SPEAKER_10]: that we launched it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, our innovations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really innovations, but in the last
week, few years, we were helping with
[SPEAKER_01]: several doctorates or master degrees for
our students on the faculty of health
[SPEAKER_01]: sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we, together with biotechnological
faculty, we have a project of improving on
[SPEAKER_01]: the different conditions on different
places in Slovenia where we follow
[SPEAKER_01]: actually our chief of lab is following the
cannabinoid and terpenid profiles from
[SPEAKER_01]: different areas for the different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we are now working on a development
of biodegradable polymers from hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I hope will sometime in the future
replace the petrol-based polymers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our work we also presented on the last
Cannabalt Conference in Colombia,
[SPEAKER_01]: also as a scientific work, where we also
presented samples, analysis of samples
[SPEAKER_01]: which was used by patients from the black
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are also following this part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's semi-legal, but it's very
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important that we obtain data
what the people are using to improve their
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is in short.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we are in Aptus.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are bio-stimulants and special
fertilizers producers.
[SPEAKER_08]: At the moment, I'm going to tell you the
three projects that we are working and at
[SPEAKER_08]: the same time collaborating with the hub,
with the universities here in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_08]: At the moment, we are doing some
evaluation of patented emulsion of plant
[SPEAKER_08]: oils on monosilicic acid as a tank mix
additive for a better performance of PPP.
[SPEAKER_08]: So trying to reduce the use of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the other side, we have developed a
grow system that is GMP certified.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's acquired with a vortex spray device
for a hybrid root system.
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, we're working with two root
systems.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are implementing some sensors
together with the students at the
[SPEAKER_08]: university, at the UPC, to improve the
system, basically.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mixing the both projects together,
we are also working at the faculty of
[SPEAKER_08]: biology here at the University of
Barcelona, optimizing the expression of
[SPEAKER_08]: genotype in specific strains of CBD hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is basically where we are right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe let's move to the last question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we open a space for questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you envision the cannabis
industry looking like in the future from a
[SPEAKER_02]: research and technology ecosystem
perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what does it depend on to fulfill
this vision?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we see working with clean,
well-sourced and under quality control
[SPEAKER_08]: formulated produce.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we want to go for a cleaner
planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the idea.
[SPEAKER_08]: To work with less residue products,
we work with non-heavy metals at all in
[SPEAKER_08]: the products.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have also developed the grow system,
as I said, to economize the grow system.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are going to work with less plants,
but at the same time, we're going to have
[SPEAKER_08]: the same production.
[SPEAKER_08]: But with this, we are going to reduce cost
of production, time, nutrients,
[SPEAKER_08]: soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: All that apart that the materials used are
all, how would you say it in English,
[SPEAKER_08]: like clean materials, not residue
materials.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think data is going to be the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why we are also working in
implementing all kinds of sensors in our
[SPEAKER_08]: crop to get the maximum data possible from
our crop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like this, we also reduce cost because we
can improve all the other treatments.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the idea that Aptos has for the
future, and this is what we are working.
[SPEAKER_09]: The connection with my idea is the data.
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, to create a future, a company with
future is essential, the innovation.
[SPEAKER_09]: For that reason, FITOPLAN is completely
focused in the science, in creating
[SPEAKER_09]: innovation.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the problem, the science,
the innovation.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have two different problems.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need that the company feel free to
create something new, and the another
[SPEAKER_09]: problem is always the same, the money.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we need?
[SPEAKER_09]: We need stable rules from the government
without variation.
We need the same rules that we have in the
United States, and that is the future of
the economy.
[SPEAKER_09]: We also need some strategies or,
during the time, or maybe interpretation
[SPEAKER_09]: of that, because if something changes,
maybe a project of three or four years
[SPEAKER_09]: could disappear in only one moment,
and something important in the morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we appreciate the government create
[SPEAKER_09]: to develop something interesting for the
community at the end, because this is the
[SPEAKER_09]: future of the society, the innovation,
the data at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Carlos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, simple legislation is the key for
developing this market, because everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that is over-regulated, you can almost not
come forward, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other things, I think,
we hope that, or maybe we see that
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody is realizing that cannabis will
be the next industrial revolution,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the point of sustainability,
you know, from, I don't know, many of
[SPEAKER_01]: things we are using today, from plastic,
from whatever can be replaced with
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant or processing the hemp has
much lower environmental and CO2 impact,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you produce whatever from
hemp, we use much less energy than if we
[SPEAKER_01]: use, you know, traditional waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that we all will, you know,
bring this together and our lawmakers will
[SPEAKER_01]: finally get it that there must be changes
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to finish, my view of the future of
that industry is to exactly replace the
[SPEAKER_10]: petrol, to see the new evolution of all
what this plant can give us, to not
[SPEAKER_10]: destroy the plant, to change the humanity,
to see that we have a powerful plant that
[SPEAKER_10]: together with data, with universities,
and with innovation, we can actually
[SPEAKER_10]: change all what we use.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our homes, our clothes, all our furniture,
our cars, everything could be made out of
[SPEAKER_10]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think this is the future that we want
to see when we create the hub.
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually within Balenveras,
we always have been trying to look for new
[SPEAKER_10]: technologies, collaborating with companies
to look for that future.
[SPEAKER_10]: The companies that are going to develop
the technologies that are going to replace
[SPEAKER_10]: the products that everyone is using are
going to be the ones that are going to
[SPEAKER_10]: have the key point to develop that
industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's not going to be for smokers,
for patients, it's going to be for
[SPEAKER_10]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's my future and my view.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please, let's work together to develop
that industry, that technologies,
[SPEAKER_10]: and that innovations, and let's do it
together.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there is a lot there, and we are
missing the point.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you need forces, we have a big
chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to add, I hope that
industry or investor will realize that
[SPEAKER_01]: there will be no moves without real
investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to develop some new product,
you need a lot of money, and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: get money from the bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those days, so we are really dependent on
this sector.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree, I agree for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: Carlos was saying brands, we say
investors, we need money, but for sure I
[SPEAKER_10]: think we need a view.
[SPEAKER_10]: Consumers will start that revolution.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once we start buying hemp clothes,
people will start doing, people will
[SPEAKER_10]: invest, companies will invest in hemp to
develop that industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we, all of us, the ones that we
are here in the world, need to start
[SPEAKER_10]: consuming hemp products to let that
revolution go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, quite an holistic change,
what we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there any question for the
speakers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, my name is Christian Gaia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm listening to more than this panel,
and everybody agrees on that the law must
[SPEAKER_03]: change, and the law makers must be
convinced, and there must be pressure on
[SPEAKER_03]: law makers and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we all know that politics is heavily
influenced by lobby work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you think about how this
process is maybe interfered by
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical lobby behind that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Totally, it's totally related.
[SPEAKER_10]: MEPs is controlled exactly by the
government.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't allow us to do research and
develop our industries here because they
[SPEAKER_10]: are the ones that have it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who is the one that is exporting cannabis
in Spain?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Linnea.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the companies related with the king
and with all what we know, Franco,
[SPEAKER_10]: and all the bad situation that we had in
that country.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for sure it's obvious.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why I was saying that if we change
that consumption, for sure it's going to
[SPEAKER_10]: be difficult to change the cannabis law.
[SPEAKER_10]: We already do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All the black market do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So everyone is consuming cannabis in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are waiting a lot, but everyone is
already using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I think is that we have the power
as consumers to start also looking to
[SPEAKER_10]: other industries.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, the lobby controls everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only us as consumers that could press
and see how it's going to change.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my view.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course, the minister of agriculture
mentioned before that the agency don't
[SPEAKER_09]: create laws, so only regulate the
situation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a politician.
[SPEAKER_09]: The answer is in the politicians.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the MPS is only a regulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: If we don't have the capacity like society
to demand a new situation, the MPS haven't
[SPEAKER_09]: the tools to do nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the minister.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I semi-agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the biggest problems are not the
politicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest problems are bureaucrats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because politicians, they change.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to go to elections at least
every four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they promise us whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes all to the bureaucratic
mills, it stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am in this process in Slovenia for 20
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on I don't know how many committees
for health and social justice and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Politicians in Slovenia, you will not find
even one politician who is against the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even politicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Police, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But bureaucrats on the ministry of health
and so on, they stop the things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they are not elected.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are there forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope this new government and the new
officials on the ministries that we will
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to change this perspective very
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Among education, of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mentioned before that of course in Spain
the bureaucratic system is chaotic and a
[SPEAKER_09]: disaster for the companies if we try to do
something new especially.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to mention that I don't know
if Slovenia is exporting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the funny part is that we don't have a
medicinal law.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we export.
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually the ones that are exporting
related with the government and all these
[SPEAKER_10]: bureaucracies.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I was saying is just look to the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look to the money.
[SPEAKER_10]: And who is the one that is exporting?
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you will have your answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's everything is shady area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regarding the single convention,
any extract of cannabis is illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even hemp extract, CBD extract is against
the single convention.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there must be changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not we will never move single
convention because it's here like for 60
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will be another.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least you know inside the European
Union or whatever because this is really
[SPEAKER_01]: nonsense after 60 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your words.
[SPEAKER_06]: My question would be a common sense logic
for the future of cannabis for example in
[SPEAKER_06]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't be it much more better if we
would have cannabis in the model like we
[SPEAKER_06]: have tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The most cannabis is grown by home
growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even more than the industry in the whole
world will grow in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the tomato model exemplifies exactly
this kind of like you have old strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the industry which is growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have you know everybody grows tomatoes
if you have a garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: And why not regulate it in the same way?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can answer that because somebody is
going to go but what about the children?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god you have to save the children
from weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just grow weed at your house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kids will get the wrong idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also when you tell a bunch of
corporations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to respond you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to convince convinced
people like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you have to address this to
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know we are fighting for this but it's
hard to explain this to the bureaucrat
[SPEAKER_01]: which is always in the same mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bureaucratic mode.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to say as an agricultural
engineer I was studying here at the
[SPEAKER_10]: University of Barcelona and I was like
yeah I really want to learn how to do the
[SPEAKER_10]: best cannabis in the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I was talking with my teachers
which is the most powerful crop with
[SPEAKER_10]: economy and he was his tomato.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's tomato?
[SPEAKER_10]: It is.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's tomato.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would say as he was mentioning you
know what about the kids and it's actually
[SPEAKER_10]: a psychoactive substance which we should
have been regulated.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would say why we don't have it as a
wine?
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have been talking a lot about that
and it's really related.
[SPEAKER_10]: We always want to have the cheapest wine
that we're going to have in the
[SPEAKER_10]: supermarket which is one liter and you are
going to be able to have your two hundred
[SPEAKER_10]: thousand whatever a really good wine.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would say I like the idea of a tomato
but I would rather prefer to compare with
[SPEAKER_10]: wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually we have a good wine law in
Slovenia which says that everybody can
[SPEAKER_01]: have wine at home as much as you want up
to I don't know thousand liters your own
[SPEAKER_01]: wine homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as you enter the market you
have to fulfill certain you know
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it should be regulated
completely the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more question from here please.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello my name is Sergio I'm a production
director in Lineo Health.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well we have all the problems that you
already mentioned about the AMs about
[SPEAKER_07]: regulatory about laws everything you
mentioned we have the same problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have the only ones who are let's
say producing for export in Spain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Many many other people's has license.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see any benefit we are getting to
be linear.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean there is nothing different from
each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I agree about what Carlos said that we
should be together in order to push new
[SPEAKER_07]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course we will be close in order to
understand what you are doing because we
[SPEAKER_07]: are doing something similar.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm here in order to know you and push
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks a lot for your comment.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be a super pleasure.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think HAP would really need to be
together with Lineo.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry if I said something that could.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was just looking to the numbers.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would not say that you are the first
exporter.
[SPEAKER_10]: No you jumped from six to twenty four
point five tons which is actually well man
[SPEAKER_10]: you did it good.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say like yeah please let's work
together.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there are a lot of companies and a
lot of projects that come from Spain to
[SPEAKER_10]: Portugal because in EPS it's really
difficult to work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And who knows why.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was my point of view.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm sure we could work together and I
would love that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry one comment because I agree that is
very it's not fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not easy because you need to have
pharmacological knowledge.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the rule exists and you can work with
EPS because I am working with two
[SPEAKER_09]: different kind of licenses during 11
years.
[SPEAKER_09]: So only like a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to make a comment about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're approaching government in the
wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at Canada and the United
States the amount of money that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: collected in taxes is wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know it right now countries need
money for infrastructure for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not approach government in a way
that we can actually save you with the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of revenue it is overtaxed in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know the different US states it's
it's incredible how much money is being
[SPEAKER_00]: collected by government.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I may add you know I know this we
are therefore we are making no new
[SPEAKER_01]: approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just this it's also human rights
and you know for example in Slovenia we
[SPEAKER_01]: spent yearly 20 million euro to prosecute
people or to you know imprison people
[SPEAKER_01]: which are on the end released by Supreme
Court because you know to help yourself it
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot be a criminal offense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why we are spending 20 million euro
yearly on nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's we have two million people in
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not big nation you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but you know now it's coming slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we all together will pull this
wagon in the same direction then it will
[SPEAKER_01]: be much easier.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to add I totally agree with
you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually we have been doing that working
teams inside the kind of is how we have
[SPEAKER_10]: been trying to evaluate how we could
proceed with a report showing to the
[SPEAKER_10]: government how taxes compare with already
countries like yours know that we already
[SPEAKER_10]: have a sample in the panel before they
were talking about how the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_10]: lobby has the power into that country.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the key.
[SPEAKER_10]: Only Spain spend the double than France
and Germany.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's something that could
related to be with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what what can we do.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was one of the points.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's do that report.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's show it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yesterday we were talking about what
can we do.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need a regulation at least into the
additional cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have been waiting.
[SPEAKER_10]: December would say the way that we were
expecting in December and we still are
[SPEAKER_10]: March and we don't have any answer.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are suffering that is going to
change the government and we still not
[SPEAKER_10]: going to fall low.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there is something telling you know
there's a huge lobby here pressing that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what can we do.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go go to the streets work together or at
least try to find a solution.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I love that point.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any more questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any more questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two more minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for the panel.
Thank you.
