[SPEAKER_05]: But we would also, we're going to be doing
about 20 minutes of back and forth,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we're going to encourage you to
ask questions from the audience,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we're not going to do this right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as they were saying on the last panel,
right, the lobbying discussion in
[SPEAKER_05]: particular is difficult, and there's some
issues in this industry that are
[SPEAKER_05]: persistent and have not been solved yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's fair to say that
everybody on this panel believes that in
[SPEAKER_05]: some way, some of the larger industry
issues in part can be solved by
[SPEAKER_05]: technology, or at least greatly aided.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to throw this question out
immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: What and where do you think technology of
whatever kind can help to continue
[SPEAKER_05]: revolutionizing this business?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if those of you guys don't know,
like Storz and Bickel is, that's who's
[SPEAKER_05]: sitting next to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to throw it to you quickly,
because everybody knows your vape and your
[SPEAKER_05]: international and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Melita.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jochen Bickel from Storz and
Bickel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are producing vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first revolutionizing technology was
in the year 2000, when we brought up the
[SPEAKER_00]: volcano vaporizer on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that time, you had to smoke it,
yeah, more or less, or to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no other viable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was one revolution, but what today
is very normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tons of products out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it become very mainstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the application form will be,
in the future, more revolutionizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see all these concentrate vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will go forward in this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see alternatives, like capsules,
what you can in chess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that the technology will go
forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just add a little plug here?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, vaping is seen as the future not
just of the cannabis business,
[SPEAKER_05]: but a lot of other medications,
a lot of other kinds of things,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, in theory it's possible,
yeah, whatever can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis is a little bit special,
because of this decarboxylation process,
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA transformed into THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There must be other substances still found
what can be viable for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what about the rest of you?
[SPEAKER_05]: And please introduce your firm quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you see technology helping to
revolutionize the business?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it sales, is it tracking, is it just
knowing what you're doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are the things that you guys see
technology revolutionizing the business?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, my name is Jeff Keen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the CEO of a company called,
or a product called, 365 Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's actually based on a Microsoft
Dynamics platform, an ERP platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way we feel we're going to help
revolutionize the space is actually taking
[SPEAKER_03]: something that works outside the industry
and bring it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're looking at the cannabis industry
like every other industry that's out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the cannabis industry in markets
like Canada and the US started out
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking it was unique in every sense,
but from a business process sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a lot of other businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Agra, it's food process
manufacturing, it's distribution,
[SPEAKER_03]: warehousing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the US, and now starting to be in
Canada, it's retail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So rather than look at it and say,
how do I solve my problems in cannabis for
[SPEAKER_03]: those things, we're bringing a platform
from outside that does all those things
[SPEAKER_03]: and applying it to the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this term seed to sale that comes
out there in the US and Canada where
[SPEAKER_03]: you're compliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do all the right business processes
and you set the system up properly,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you're automatically going to be
compliant and you achieve your seed to
[SPEAKER_03]: sale that you hear so often in the US and
Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody else have some feedback here or?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hey, hello everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Zana Setti.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the CEO, founder of Greenworks
Consulting.
[SPEAKER_07]: The way that technology has actually
revolutionized the industry in my eyes is
[SPEAKER_07]: that it's helped us scale, it's helped us
automate, it's helped us accelerate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally for me, I'm launching a
software called Odyssey.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's focused on licensing and permitting
for cannabis businesses in the US.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really accelerated and scaled the
process of being able to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though we can't fully automate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that you can equate it to
something like the TurboTax or LegalZoom
[SPEAKER_07]: of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's focused on a lot of the
pre-licensed aspects of getting these
[SPEAKER_07]: entrepreneurs licensed, getting them up
and running.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've seen everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: In my 25 years of doing this, I've seen
everything from just these seed to sale
[SPEAKER_07]: tracking inventory control systems all the
way to robots, AI, drones inside
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: That are spotting things like disease,
pests, and controlling these and
[SPEAKER_07]: automating it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're going to see the same thing
when it comes down to drop shipping
[SPEAKER_07]: medication eventually.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really interesting to see how
technology is really taking this to the
[SPEAKER_07]: next level.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're really excited to see that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to jump in here for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you see, and I agree with you,
technology is helping to normalize as well
[SPEAKER_05]: as automate routine processes that evolve.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also in part slowed down this
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that fair to say?
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have yet to see some of the best
out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: As we go through this innovation period,
it's almost like a renaissance period of
[SPEAKER_07]: technology.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're seeing more and more and more come
out every single day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And everybody's just really taking it to
the next level.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Manny.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the chief product officer and interim
CEO of Navistat Technologies.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a Canadian company.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a fully vertically integrated
e-commerce platform.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Canada specifically, we have a sales
only license, which essentially forces us
[SPEAKER_06]: to be a technology pure play company.
[SPEAKER_06]: We leverage technology to enable
optimization of the user experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we deliver solutions such as
education, telemedicine applications,
[SPEAKER_06]: the ability to purchase cannabis online,
same day delivery, journaling,
[SPEAKER_06]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can talk about each one of these
technologies or siloed assets.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's separately.
[SPEAKER_06]: But my bias is, and it's going to be very
hyped, is around artificial intelligence.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things that we're focused
on is to try and understand how we can
[SPEAKER_06]: leverage AI to help people find the right
product for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually brought one of our lead
machine learning engineers with me so that
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody can harass them and see I'm not
just making stuff up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just like the fintech industry was
really changed where you have people who
[SPEAKER_06]: are very, very passionate about what
they're doing and understanding regulation
[SPEAKER_06]: and using technology to change that
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we still see that impact since 2009
until today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fintech is still changing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally, we're in the infancy days of
technology and cannabis combined.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, MedPay, for those of you who
don't know what it is, it's not MedPay to
[SPEAKER_05]: advertise, but we are using blockchain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're actually, I mean, no matter what
the technology is, I think here,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's hardware or software,
there are ways to use existing technology
[SPEAKER_05]: to automate processes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are ways to use new technology to
push the envelope.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole bunch of innovation that's
coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the things also that struck me
about this panel was how international it
[SPEAKER_05]: is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have people here with international
experience, and technology certainly
[SPEAKER_05]: across oceans is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of us are looking at the
compliance space one way or another.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about, just a shout out, where do you
think the international cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_05]: in some ways has started to reform or put
pressure on or change the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry in other places?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how does this industry now being
international play into the
[SPEAKER_05]: revolutionizing idea of tech and its
application?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you see that happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: The last 12 months, we've distributed into
90 countries around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very international and it's
everywhere available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, with this technology,
you have then the way how you can consume
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in a medical way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have then an app with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can track all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the technology is really nowadays
distributed worldwide in a very fast way.
[SPEAKER_05]: But his compliance is different from
country to country, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we are a European country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are here a medical device manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A medical device manufacturer means that
he needs to have a quality management
[SPEAKER_00]: system that's called traceability,
what is called see to sale on the other
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the device and traceability,
if you get back a defective device with a
[SPEAKER_00]: serial number, you must be able to track
back where you purchased every single part
[SPEAKER_00]: you built in and where you have it sold
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other requirements are relatively
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are different from country to
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we don't have a medical
device in the USA because the FDA is not
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to approve a medical device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you go to Israel, you have,
of course, other requirements labeling in
[SPEAKER_00]: Hebrew, in Arabic, can also be a little
bit challenging and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the latest compliance thing we got is
the GDPR, the general directive from the
[SPEAKER_00]: SGFO.
[SPEAKER_05]: Privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, privacy law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you also another compliance
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I think from people from North
America, they are not ready for the GDPR
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as I can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the law is less than a year
old, but it's a strict law and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: a highly punished law and it will be
followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it will also affect a lot of
people who touch Europe in any way with
[SPEAKER_00]: their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some compliance coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take the next one because it's an
interesting question on compliance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do business in Canada, US,
and there's a number of international
[SPEAKER_03]: companies in Colombia, Jamaica,
Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Denmark that we're dealing with right now
in the cannabis industry, but the platform
[SPEAKER_03]: is already international.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at the platform we're using
for ERP is already almost in every country
[SPEAKER_03]: in the world, including Germany,
just not in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Canadians, when they came into the
space with their LPs, and we came in a few
[SPEAKER_03]: years afterwards, we saw the legacy of
this, compliance to them was just,
[SPEAKER_03]: am I compliant to Health Canada and I'm
meeting the regulations so I can keep my
[SPEAKER_03]: license?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they didn't think about compliance in
any other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now all of a sudden the Canadians are
coming to us and asking us for GMP.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I think they probably had to
look up the acronym as most of us do,
[SPEAKER_03]: good manufacturing process, which in order
to export your product from Canada to
[SPEAKER_03]: countries like Germany, you have to prove
that you are a GMP processing facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Canadians weren't thinking of that
at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think in some ways, the international
space has a way to benefit from what was
[SPEAKER_03]: already learned in the US and Canada,
not do the same things, look at it as a
[SPEAKER_03]: business that has to be compliant versus a
compliant industry specific to cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: that has to run a business and there's
compliance everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: GDPR, GMP, FDA requirements are not in the
US yet, but they're coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all these things have to be in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're public companies now trading.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now SOX compliance and how your
financial reporting goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually had to employ, which I
didn't think I'd ever have to do running a
[SPEAKER_03]: software company, is hire a compliance
chief officer just for us to handle not
[SPEAKER_03]: only what's going on in cannabis,
but also the compliance that's coming at
[SPEAKER_03]: us from everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna push this one to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a discussion about what can
technology do to revolutionize the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think sales and advertising is certainly
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: However controversial, and I wanted to
throw it in that direction because the
[SPEAKER_05]: questions about how technology can be
applied to overcome some of the bigger
[SPEAKER_05]: issues, whether it's compliance or laws or
et cetera, and certainly sales online,
[SPEAKER_05]: the discussion of the industry press
online 2014, helped push forward a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you see this working?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you see this technology discussion
changing regulatory frameworks that are
[SPEAKER_05]: still holding the industry back like
advertising or et cetera?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a very important point to
remember that everybody's very afraid of
[SPEAKER_06]: compliance, GDPR, and they're very worried
about what are we gonna do with it,
[SPEAKER_06]: but essentially if you look at it,
it could be a huge opportunity because the
[SPEAKER_06]: existence of GDPR raises the bar and
allows you, if you build systems in place
[SPEAKER_06]: to comply, with that allows you to create
modes around your business.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, part of GDPR, and I'll get
to the advertising and sales point in a
[SPEAKER_06]: moment, part of GDPR is security by design
or segregating data, not collecting data
[SPEAKER_06]: that you shouldn't if you don't need it
for true process.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, one of the things with
automatic processing of data is that it's
[SPEAKER_06]: not exposed to humans.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can segregate it within the system
and then you're protected from a
[SPEAKER_06]: compliance perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can automate a lot of the requirements
that GDPR has and then you create those
[SPEAKER_06]: modes around the business and you use that
as an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Specifically around sales and marketing,
that's really interesting because I spent
[SPEAKER_06]: the morning talking with a lot of CBD
producers and suppliers here and the one
[SPEAKER_06]: thing that everybody spoke about is like,
we cannot advertise, we cannot sell our
[SPEAKER_06]: products online, or so we cannot advertise
our products online even though there was
[SPEAKER_06]: a panel previously that spoke about the
exact same point.
[SPEAKER_06]: And CBD, let's take it as an example,
in many countries, is completely legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the big advertising networks like
Google and Facebook, AdSense, DoubleClick,
[SPEAKER_06]: et cetera, those are the ones that don't
allow you to advertise.
[SPEAKER_05]: And guess what happened to Google and GDPR
in France?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to come back to you though
because I think your system actually helps
[SPEAKER_05]: people comply by automating it literally
by using the legal form.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're kind of combining those two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to talk a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, just as you were stating about the
different countries that have different
[SPEAKER_07]: laws or that are just coming out a lot or
becoming aware and educated, just in the
[SPEAKER_07]: state of California alone, it's like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like the whole world or all the
world's policies in one state.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as we go from city to county to the
state level, it's all different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like you go throughout the United
States, it's all different.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've had to find a way to kind of jump
that based on best practices.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that the FDA is going to step in
eventually, just like you have.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should always be focused on good
manufacturing practices or good business
[SPEAKER_07]: practices.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very important factor when you're
coming in and exporting to the EU as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you're not compliant,
then you're not going to be able to serve
[SPEAKER_07]: that market.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that when it comes down to it,
when it comes down to technology,
[SPEAKER_07]: let me ask real quick, how many people in
this room right now are in a startup mode
[SPEAKER_07]: for a tech company or are in a tech
company right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: How many people?
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are not limited is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: With technology, you can license that
technology.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can take that technology to other
countries.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not limited like cannabis is
limited.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the fact that we are a technology
firm, we're able to actually serve more
[SPEAKER_07]: markets than our counterparts who are in
the cannabis industry trying to get
[SPEAKER_07]: licenses on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing that we always need to
compare that to, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_06]: you said license technology to others,
is AWS.
[SPEAKER_06]: AWS started as an internal solution for
Amazon because they couldn't find
[SPEAKER_06]: something that met their needs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it grew to a $10 billion per year
business because who here doesn't or uses
[SPEAKER_06]: AWS in their business, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we can all agree that in some
ways, technology is revolutionizing the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry because it's normalizing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's saying this is just a commodity or et
cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as a way of a lead-in, I saw a lot of
hands go up.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of people in startups,
and we would like to now open the field
[SPEAKER_05]: for questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have questions, please go ahead
and bounce them back to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because one of the things we were talking
about before we came on here is I think
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm one of the few people actually who's
gone through the German incubation system.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are opportunities if you are
starting to look at applying technology
[SPEAKER_05]: and want to apply technology in this
revolutionary business, where you can
[SPEAKER_05]: start to enter the market in new and
different ways, in part by normalizing
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: In part by saying I'm not just dealing
with cannabis as this crazy plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm dealing with a narcotic that's an
off-label drug that has to be approved or
[SPEAKER_05]: et cetera, or I have to track a plant for
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think how would you say that,
and I'm gonna pick on you again,
[SPEAKER_05]: how would you say that technology has
changed the equation in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: normalization, if that makes any sense?
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, you have to go through
insurance approvals as a medical equipment
[SPEAKER_05]: provider.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the only person on stage who has to
go through that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So technology is also adding a different
level of compliance to you as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that revolutionary to you, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: As a medical device manufacturer,
of course, there are a lot of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: devices, so it's not so important if it is
for cannabis or for something else,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to follow the medical device
rules, and they are there, and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: comply, you comply, and there's also no
reason then to decline any allowance to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the insurance side, yeah, we have tried
to get here in Germany, generally
[SPEAKER_00]: recovered, to get on, there's a list,
a Hilfsmittel list there, where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get on, then you get, then the doctor can
prescribe it, and the patient get it
[SPEAKER_00]: reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, we have not reached to
get on this list yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are still too many hurdles,
and they are still unsure, and they fear
[SPEAKER_00]: that they get a lot of prescription for
it, but that we are working for,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully soon we will have to,
we are on that list.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can work together on that question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, for example, you, for example,
are actually in a licensing and processing
[SPEAKER_05]: approval discussion, correct?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, essentially, again, it comes back
to the regulations at the state level in
[SPEAKER_07]: the U.S., in this case, in Germany or
other areas, if they were to do licensing,
[SPEAKER_07]: it would be at the, obviously,
the government level.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we do is we sort of analyze when
regulations come out, regulations are
[SPEAKER_07]: shifting and changing, it's dynamic
compliance, I like to call it,
[SPEAKER_07]: really, because this whole space is very
dynamic, so when it comes down to it,
[SPEAKER_07]: we have to really navigate these
processes, but if we can accelerate it and
[SPEAKER_07]: lower the barrier of entry and promote
more diversity, and bring more players
[SPEAKER_07]: into this game, and really get it to the
point where folks can really innovate,
[SPEAKER_07]: we are going to see a hyper-jump in that
space, in terms of technology,
[SPEAKER_07]: in terms of how folks actually operate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we want to ensure that,
first, that you guys get permitted and
[SPEAKER_07]: regulated and licensed, and then there's
ongoing compliance partners that handle
[SPEAKER_07]: everything else, because everybody's
focused on that section as opposed to the
[SPEAKER_07]: pre-licensed section.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where our focus is.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, coming back to technology and
how it's changing, changing the face of
[SPEAKER_07]: the landscape, there's things like the
internet of things, for instance,
[SPEAKER_07]: IOT, where we're seeing IOT manage how the
plant's growing, checking, there's full
[SPEAKER_07]: automation on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so as a business owner that's trying
to scale and serve a high demand in this
[SPEAKER_07]: marketplace, things like that are pretty
important.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it lowers the cost associated with
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're able to really magnify the ability
to grow this plant exactly the same way
[SPEAKER_07]: over and over again, which is consistency.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a fractured supply chain,
not only on the global level, but just
[SPEAKER_07]: based in the US or just based in the state
of California.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still a fractured supply chain.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're not able to get the same
consistency of products, because
[SPEAKER_07]: businesses are scaling, and this is a
plant that changes its consistency over
[SPEAKER_07]: the course of time as you scale it,
or add nutrients, or add different
[SPEAKER_07]: lighting, or add different management
techniques on the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really interesting to see how
technology's shaping that, but most
[SPEAKER_07]: importantly, is that this innovation is
gonna never stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna happen over and over and over
again, just like with the internet when it
[SPEAKER_07]: first came out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I like to compare it to that,
because that's how fast this thing is
[SPEAKER_07]: moving.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I would highly recommend taking
advantage of that, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm gonna throw this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anybody with questions right now
who wants to ask the panel anything?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you had a specific issue that you
wanted to bring up.
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of, I think that you were sort of
talking about the fact that to try to take
[SPEAKER_05]: it to the next level, that all of us,
in some ways, from a technology panel,
[SPEAKER_05]: or technology solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just generally, lessons learned,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming with it from a platform that
already works in other industries,
[SPEAKER_03]: and coming into the cannabis space,
into North America.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, the international space has
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to set
[SPEAKER_03]: their business up from the ground up,
not only because cannabis is new,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the businesses are new, and setting it
up the right way with technology,
[SPEAKER_03]: and making some of the right decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: companies that are in the space have
probably gone through two, three,
[SPEAKER_03]: four different iterations of solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever they tried in the beginning
didn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're now on to multiple others.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from our standpoint, this is where
we're now coming in from the outside,
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, you're in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grow in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have been growing in greenhouses
for decades, hundreds of years,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's already software out there
that does that for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why are you trying to apply brand new
software to something that's already
[SPEAKER_03]: established out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're kind of coming at it from a
different way, saying, you're in supply
[SPEAKER_03]: chain management that does agriculture,
that does food process manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_03]: distribution, and potentially retail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for us, we're not looking at it having
to introduce something brand new because
[SPEAKER_03]: the space requires it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to normalize it by saying,
it already exists out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make the same mistakes that the
others did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you buying software from the ground
up that isn't proven anywhere yet,
[SPEAKER_03]: but is trying to find itself in the
cannabis space because it's going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: outscaled.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you normalize the business out there,
all those other things start to hit you,
[SPEAKER_03]: the normal business processes that every
other business runs in.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the end, you're here to make money on
these businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just about you're in the cannabis
industry and what software will work for
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, see, and this is where I'm hoping to
introduce a little bit of controversy
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So obviously, your bed pay is using a new
technology called blockchain, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you integrate that into a new
industry while minimizing risk and
[SPEAKER_05]: attacking the issues that you're
attacking?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, one of the ways that we have decided
to go forward on this is actually blending
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're holding workshops where we're
bringing stakeholders together who aren't
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily tech geeks, but they're
business people with problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're coming together and they're
discussing them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is how we're starting to,
I think, also start to pin new technology
[SPEAKER_05]: processes and re-engineering into a new
business, which it very much is here.
[SPEAKER_05]: As much as we are, I guess, re-engineering
processes, so I think that this,
[SPEAKER_05]: for us, the cannabis vertical has given us
a way to address a larger problem that is
[SPEAKER_05]: faced, for example, by the chronically
ill, people who need to get expensive
[SPEAKER_05]: medical equipment, pharmacies,
people who are touching this ecosystem but
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't necessarily have another way to
touch it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm going to throw something also out
here because everyone's talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: this, the whole enabling aspect or not
enabling aspect, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: talking privacy and all the other issues
about online sex.
[SPEAKER_05]: Online sales, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because online discussion about this
industry, I think, has very much led to
[SPEAKER_05]: greater legalization as much as
governments have not maybe gotten the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation right so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: But clearly, I think the online discussion
in technology does lead to online sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would anybody like to take a dive into
that and also from the enabling and also
[SPEAKER_05]: the privacy perspective?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anyone?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can talk about the online aspect
of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, at the end of the day,
that's where the industry or all
[SPEAKER_06]: businesses are going to, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because as humans, we are lazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We want the path of least resistance.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I'm able to sit at home and if we
look at the full stack of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: industry and if I'm able to get a
prescription without leaving my house and
[SPEAKER_06]: then buy a volcano without leaving my
house and have it delivered, I will likely
[SPEAKER_06]: prefer it over having to leave,
get in my car, drive through snow,
[SPEAKER_06]: see a doctor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, go to a pharmacy, pick up the
product, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in regards to e-commerce, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, I'm quite biased, so I can
continue talking about that aspect for a
[SPEAKER_06]: while.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is something that is driving this
industry forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let me be a devil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it e-commerce or is it telemedicine?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that there are two
aspects.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the telemedicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the e-commerce.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the do people feel comfortable not
seeing a doctor?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are regulatory agencies particularly when
you get into the narcotics side of this
[SPEAKER_05]: going to say, yo, the year is a schedule
two and you don't have to kind of see a
[SPEAKER_05]: doctor anymore?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that realistic?
[SPEAKER_05]: In Germany, Jürgen?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I read that you can get online to a
doctor and you can claim to be ill for
[SPEAKER_00]: your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a new system who is available
here, but it's very controversial.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the doctor doesn't get paid yet,
by the way, so there's some issue there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe another general remark about
compliance, because it was here about
[SPEAKER_00]: fearing compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very important to be
compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every managing director,
CEO, must take care to be compliant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially in this field, because on
the one hand, you don't want to get extra
[SPEAKER_00]: help because you are treating something
with cannabis, but on the other hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you also do not want to be very favored
because it's cannabis and you don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the sites you want to see,
you don't want to get extra help,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you also want not to get any easy way
on something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move a bit beyond compliance,
because I think technology can also be
[SPEAKER_05]: used for research, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And sort of the big data gathering
aspects, I think, of basically all of what
[SPEAKER_05]: we've decided.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think what's interesting about
you guys is you're moving more and more
[SPEAKER_05]: into a world where you can gather
information online.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, through the vape,
I would assume, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But regardless, I mean, there's definitely
this whole discussion now about digital
[SPEAKER_05]: health in the cloud and privacy issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you, Eddie, want to touch on
that one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we actually built, let's start with
the problem, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is that a lot of people use
cannabis, but there is no way for them to
[SPEAKER_06]: actually measure if it's helping them or
not.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are not a lot, but quite a few
companies that build solutions to address
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are one of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a great company that is out here
today, Strain Print, that does the same
[SPEAKER_06]: thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It essentially allows people to track
usage and the impact of products on their
[SPEAKER_06]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And initially, at least that's when we
released this, we're like, no one's ever
[SPEAKER_06]: going to give us any data.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were very surprised to see that
actually people were very forthcoming.
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't Germans, though, were they,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they might be Germans, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But people were very, very forthcoming
with the data, because there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: value that was created in exchange for
that data.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something that is actually
moving forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the idea of being able to collect real
data from real people and analyze it and
[SPEAKER_06]: generate insights has value across the
entire industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, for patients, for example,
we're able to recommend what strains are
[SPEAKER_06]: right or wrong for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the industry, we're able to help
growers understand what's popular,
[SPEAKER_06]: what they need to grow, because of grow
cycles.
[SPEAKER_06]: For device manufacturers, they can
understand what temperatures people are
[SPEAKER_06]: using, is it conduction, convection based,
what are the most popular models,
[SPEAKER_06]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is so many different elements that
can be used that are valuable for both
[SPEAKER_06]: parts of the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hands up, how many people involved here
in the startup side are using technology
[SPEAKER_05]: in education?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hands up.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many are using it in compliance?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many are using it for medical
processing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, anybody else who wants to speak up?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we really are trying to encourage
technology companies to come forward and
[SPEAKER_05]: talk about their experiences, because we
can all learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I will say that my experience here
has been actually to sort of use some of
[SPEAKER_05]: the stigma around this plant to actually
get people to agree to start to use new
[SPEAKER_05]: technology, for example.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if people agree, we had this
narcotic, and yes, we need to track it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And no, we can't really do this,
because GDPR says we can't follow this,
[SPEAKER_05]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that does also create a new
opportunity to apply new technology in a
[SPEAKER_05]: new way to fix problems that are affecting
this industry as it normalizes and
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially other pieces of a larger
vertical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have any of you had experiences with that
that you would like to talk to?
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'd like to come back to what
you stated about how there's nothing new
[SPEAKER_07]: here, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, at the end of the day,
there's technology out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not about reinventing the wheel.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about making that wheel way much
better, way better than what it is,
[SPEAKER_07]: because here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The technology we developed, it was really
kind of out of multiple different pieces.
[SPEAKER_07]: We took the best of several different
pieces of technology that worked in our
[SPEAKER_07]: field and infused it together into
something that's brand-spanking new.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the same thing goes for a lot of these
different factors.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you don't need to create
anything new, even unless it's something
[SPEAKER_07]: that has to be created new.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I encourage you guys to look out there
and see and do a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because before you spend all this money or
your investors' money, for that matter,
[SPEAKER_07]: on a lot of different things that is
already existing, just do a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: research first, because there's a lot of
things out there that already serve that
[SPEAKER_07]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're seeing a merge of all these
different industries merge into the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis industry from all different
fields.
[SPEAKER_07]: That includes medicine, that includes
technology, that includes agriculture,
[SPEAKER_07]: that includes retail, that includes supply
chain tracking, that includes all
[SPEAKER_07]: different logistics and transportation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's so many different things
happening globally that you just got to
[SPEAKER_07]: take from all these different industries
and then apply your own sort of style to
[SPEAKER_07]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also want to real quickly talk about
this whole telemedicine aspect of this,
[SPEAKER_07]: or just working with patients and
gathering that data.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: His name's Dr. Len May.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's based on Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he runs a company called Endocanna
Health.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, what Endocanna Health does is they
take your 23 and Me data and translate it,
[SPEAKER_07]: the information, into what you need for
you and what would work best for you in
[SPEAKER_07]: terms of cannabis products, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: What would work worse for you in terms of
causing stress or anxiety or different
[SPEAKER_07]: things like that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, really cool technology.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this way you're able to get highly
targeted patient data that's really
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you know exactly what works for
you, because what will work for one person
[SPEAKER_07]: may not work for the other person,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really important to see that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to jump into here,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the difference in privacy, the approach
to privacy from a technology perspective,
[SPEAKER_05]: is very, very different depending on where
you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you're in California,
home of Google, and we don't care about
[SPEAKER_05]: privacy, and I'm going to say that because
they just got the suit here in France.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that there is a wide
opportunity here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that that is one of the issues
that we see is that privacy and the
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding of what privacy is of where
that data can go and who can have access
[SPEAKER_05]: to that and why is a discussion that I
think the cannabis industry in general and
[SPEAKER_05]: patients and doctors should step up on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're in that space.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't believe that private companies
should have as much information about
[SPEAKER_05]: people as they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we see GDPR to your point,
I think, as a way of setting a much higher
[SPEAKER_05]: standard where patients actually have
control when they don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that in itself is something that we
can enable with the use of technology
[SPEAKER_05]: while giving industry more information
that they ever possibly could have hoped
[SPEAKER_05]: for, but it is completely anonymized
because of the way that we approach it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe that is one of the ways to talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can talk a bit about privacy
because I think this is a huge,
[SPEAKER_05]: huge discussion that is not often talked
about because people like GDPR,
[SPEAKER_05]: it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't affect my business.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Germany or in Europe right now,
a GDPR violation, one GDPR violation,
[SPEAKER_05]: they can ding you 4% of global sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you think about just the cannabis
perspective of this beyond the fact that
[SPEAKER_05]: privacy as a medical discussion should be
baked into all of us, this particularly
[SPEAKER_05]: can hurt a company who has small medical
sales here in Germany but a global
[SPEAKER_05]: footprint, for example.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do you think that, and I'm going to
maybe end this a little bit early because
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to speed things up and make sure
this conference goes on, but how do you
[SPEAKER_05]: see technology influencing the privacy
conversation?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say if you want to add in the
cannabis industry, fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that technology can be used to
highlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, you're going to,
are you making plans to give people their
[SPEAKER_05]: own personal cloud access, for example?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or in your industry, are you thinking
about the fact that, yeah, I've got to,
[SPEAKER_05]: are there privacy aspects on the B2B side
that maybe we haven't thought about?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that is, from my
perspective, that is where I spend a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of my time thinking and planning and
working, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just jump in there because what you just
said is so complex depending on where you
[SPEAKER_03]: are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we conduct business in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's over 30 states that we're having
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: We deal with Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: The data that we take from our customers
is not our data.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put it into Azure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your environment and our model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the data is yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just have to help you manage it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Canada, the data has to stay inside
of Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a technology company, we have to put
platforms up everywhere that comply to
[SPEAKER_03]: that requirement that really has nothing
to do with cannabis, has more to do with
[SPEAKER_03]: the data side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So privacy relates to the consumer,
but it also relates to your data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's coming to us looking for
aggregated data on your business,
[SPEAKER_03]: not just from what you're selling to
patients, but what products you're
[SPEAKER_03]: selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every other industry has aggregated data
that they're looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you come from the hotel industry,
every hotel knows how busy this hotel was
[SPEAKER_03]: last night, what the occupancy was here as
it compares to everybody else,
[SPEAKER_03]: and what the average room rate was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this industry needs to know the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What products should I be selling?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much does it cost me to produce that
product?
[SPEAKER_03]: How can it be more efficient?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to share the aggregated data
as a community so that we can all get
[SPEAKER_03]: better at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then there's the privacy of that
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't give that data out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That has to be you guys providing that
data amongst yourselves, and then a
[SPEAKER_03]: community setting itself up where that
aggregated data gets used.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we're being signaled from the
side here that we're running out of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last call for any questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can catch us later.
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salah from Clever Botanics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The conversation is very interesting,
because we launched our online shop in the
[SPEAKER_01]: UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plan was to produce two apps,
one for Android, one for iOS, and connect
[SPEAKER_01]: the Shopify into the app.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we sell a product, we want to
capture the information from the customer,
[SPEAKER_01]: how they used it, and how it can help for
us to choose the next product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the GDPR thing you talked about is
very interesting, because we are already
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to sell not just in the UK,
but generally in France.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we sort of manage that is a
thing that I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder whether you have any ideas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come talk to us later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I take your call.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rule is privacy by default or privacy
by design.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tracking you have needs to be
disabled.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you are able to ask your client that
he shares the information with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to say why you want the data
to be collected, what kind of data you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to collect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to ask for permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And patients can ask for it back.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the other thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is a combo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, GDPR sounds scary, but it's quite
simple.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as you get consent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is a reason for you to have that
consent, which sounds like you want to
[SPEAKER_06]: provide better service to your customers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just build your privacy policy in a way
that gets that consent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can do pretty much whatever
you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as you define yourself as the data
controller.
[SPEAKER_05]: Short answer is complicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: And see us later, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a quick question.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you talk about AI and all these
things, how do you deal with implicit
[SPEAKER_04]: biases or the challenges you have of
gathering quality information?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can make the smartest machine,
but if you tell it dumb shit, it's going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be a dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like garbage in, garbage out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The expert evidence in the Vancouver
dispensary case was that patients want to
[SPEAKER_02]: see the product, smell the product,
like going to the grocery store and buying
[SPEAKER_02]: your groceries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you deal with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a license to sell online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada only allows that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you and Shoppers Drug Mart are the
only ones who have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical patients only get it in the mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they complain that it's in the
container.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to open it up sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some problem with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They send it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it delays them getting their medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the evidence from the patients,
and an expert, Dr. Zimbarkus from the
[SPEAKER_02]: states, was that this was a very important
part of delivering medical for medical
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure if the drone can come and
drop down and give an option and go back
[SPEAKER_02]: up and you can pick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how are you going to deal with that
technology?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, actually, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but in Germany, actually, that's illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to go to the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the medical, I guess, culture here,
I mean, the appartegas are trained to
[SPEAKER_05]: actually, I mean, that's why they want
patients to go to the pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_05]: to literally have the pharmacist who is
trained in this, hand over that drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to your point, there may be regulatory
issues that say you can't do it as you're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing in Canada, which affects how they
cease to sale, for example.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you're going to also,
in terms of access issues, if you're too
[SPEAKER_05]: sick to get to the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But those are places where technology can,
in fact, begin to start to connect them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as we find privacy issues,
all are all the way along this,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's not just a product that you
can buy like a regular commodity product.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is still stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_05]: So privacy is in the room at every single
point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, I think it's going to be
based on preference.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you prefer to have a drop ship
to your front door, then OK, but that will
[SPEAKER_07]: never replace the retail experience of you
going in there and smelling different
[SPEAKER_07]: things.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing it will do is enhance it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're seeing enhancement of that retail
experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Vancouver's a lot different than
Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the evolution from medical to
rent that we're seeing as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're coming from an American
perspective, you're already going,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, isn't it just like alcohol?
[SPEAKER_03]: And why can't you buy it and consume it
like you do alcohol?
[SPEAKER_03]: And internationally, we're still talking
about it medically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And is it a medicine?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you pick it up in a pharmacy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you get it online?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think if you look forward a few
years, you're going to see that same
[SPEAKER_03]: change happen that's happening in North
America as it tries to embrace it in a
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational adult use way and have a
retail experience around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you know what's interesting
about Canada?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in Canada, it seems like the privacy
aspect was not really brought up until it
[SPEAKER_05]: went into the recreational market,
which is an interesting twist,
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that question regards to brick and
mortar versus e-commerce is we shouldn't
[SPEAKER_06]: even talk about it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the same question that was 30 years
ago in regards to, or 20 years ago in
[SPEAKER_06]: regards to e-commerce in general.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you see e-commerce growing
endlessly and malls in the US.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it has nothing to do with privacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was talking about the consumer
experience of choosing a product without
[SPEAKER_06]: being able to touch, smell, and understand
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a classic question of
e-commerce.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, weed is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to go a little long
because I'm getting passionate now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Weed is different than lumber or a
blender, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to smell a blender.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't need to look at the crystals on
a blender, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to smell your weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to look at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You maybe want to talk to the person.
[SPEAKER_04]: About the genetics and you want to know
something about the grower and how it was
[SPEAKER_04]: growing and all these other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's completely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't always get that experience
online.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a maturity of the industry,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because right now, I think that's because
inconsistent product might be coming
[SPEAKER_03]: through and you can't get the same
experience each time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, you can give five different
growers the same cut and come up with five
[SPEAKER_04]: different styles and five different smells
and five different effects all from the
[SPEAKER_04]: same weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really hard to, it's not an IDA or
a double buck or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very hard to get different,
to make sure people are consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: The blue dream from one person is
different than the blue dream from another
[SPEAKER_04]: person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not generic like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the other thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, I know that this discussion is
saying that there's fewer privacy
[SPEAKER_05]: discussions in e-commerce, but there are
actually a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a question?
[SPEAKER_05]: There was another question.
[SPEAKER_04]: What time is it though?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're running super late.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a fun one.
Thank you.
