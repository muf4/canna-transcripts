[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us for the
medical cannabis and adult use panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did quite a lot of talk about the
recreational legalisation in Germany and
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a lot of discussion about what the
future is going to look like for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis companies, the policy,
the patients and the industry as a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: when recreational legalisation comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pleasure to be here with Blair
and Pamis today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be discussing some of these
impacts here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Gilly Templeton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm head of announcers at Hanway
Associates.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work closely with cannabis companies to
provide them strategic and regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: advice as well as market entry services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hanway is the advisory arm for Hanway
Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a venture studio looking to build
the infrastructure to launch and scale
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses that are needed by new markets
created by drug policy reforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also run the network First Wednesdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to read any of our free
reports, they're all available online as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm joined today by JÃ¼rgen Bickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the managing director and co-founder
of Stores and Bickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a manufacturer of premium medical
vaporisers, all made in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their most iconic product, as I'm sure
many of you know, the Volcano,
[SPEAKER_00]: was actually the first medically approved
cannabis vaporiser in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really known as the gold standard among
medical prescribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got about 22 years' experience in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also joined by Thomas Chaton.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the CEO and one of the co-founders of
420 Pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a German-based wholesaler,
importer, distributor and producer of
[SPEAKER_00]: high-grade medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, quite a lot of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been active in the market since
2018 and the inception of the medical
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: After an initial interest in music,
Thomas first founded his first company 12
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a lot of experience in software
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to the cannabis opportunity,
he decided to leave that role and step out
[SPEAKER_00]: of his CEO role to join 420 Pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's quite a strong sign of how
much you are here in London and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thirdly, we are joined by Bozdar,
who is a vocal, very highly respected
[SPEAKER_00]: activist in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got over two decades of advocacy
across Slovenia, across the EU and across
[SPEAKER_00]: the Balkans.
[SPEAKER_00]: He holds several positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the president of Fifth, the Human
Rights Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a member of the International
Association for Cannabis Medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also a founder of the Research Nature
Institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Research Nature Institute also have a
lot of experience to share with us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got very deep insight into
cannabis use among patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're interested in the quality of the
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to test the laboratory,
so they're pretty much in and out of these
[SPEAKER_00]: products day in and day out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really enjoyed by this panel and
looking forward to getting stuck in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, Joachim, to kick things off,
it would be great to hear a bit about how
[SPEAKER_00]: you think the medical market will be
affected by legalisation in Germany and
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you think it will continue to grow
as we've seen or there will be some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of shift when recreational access opens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hello everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: What will happen to the medical market in
the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: The medical market is well developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Germany, I think since 2017,
it's a good development.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the same development that has
happened in many countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: First there was a medical market and
afterwards there started discussions about
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational and so it has more or less
paved the way in the direction of
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can assume today that a certain amount
of people inside the medical system maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: would drop out if there would be a legal
alternative available.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, when discussions about
cannabis came more broadly available,
[SPEAKER_02]: there will be new patients also available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe also resistance to blitzkrieg will
come down.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the moment we see the most restrictions
in the medical cannabis market by missing
[SPEAKER_02]: doctors who really blitzkrieg,
who really believe in cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall, although we have seen,
like in Canada, we have seen that the
[SPEAKER_02]: medical market has went down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think this is necessarily the case
in Germany because the medical market is
[SPEAKER_02]: not so big at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have seen the numbers this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people believe that 800,000 patients
will be available and we have not even
[SPEAKER_02]: half of them at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I only believe that the medical market
will grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem, what also was several times
discussed this morning, is the supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: What will people do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will there be enough supply for the
medical market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have the double standards that they
discussed?
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, for a producer, if you can have
it more easy to grow recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of medical cannabis, of course you
may switch to this side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, I think for the government,
it must be a priority that the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: market is first served and then the
recreational market is served.
[SPEAKER_02]: A patient who really needs the medicine,
who needs it daily to handle his pain or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, must be a priority for the
government before a recreational user can
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy his cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you raised some interesting
questions there around where supply will
[SPEAKER_00]: come from, how the kind of framework will
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thomas, I guess from your experience
working with distribution and with
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators so far, how do you kind of
think that legalisation may look in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany and how do you think things will
proceed going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any sort of vision on where we
can be going?
[SPEAKER_01]: So after we heard some keynote from our
hook-up leaders here, in the panel,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure that they will have a very
strong look at the medical market and the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience we just collected in the last
five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty sure they will be very open
towards that topic because the time is
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very right, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this all over the world,
just spreading cannabis as a new market,
[SPEAKER_01]: even for medical and recreational
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very dangerous to have this
double standard stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, the medical market,
it's very important that the research and
[SPEAKER_01]: development continues because you
definitely have to differentiate your
[SPEAKER_01]: product portfolio between rec market and
medical market because at the moment you
[SPEAKER_01]: have lots of strains in the market and you
sometimes have to problem-solve what is
[SPEAKER_01]: the exact cure of that strain and opposite
to another strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the fact why a lot of doctors
refuse from that topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty sure that they will have a
very, very open discussion for rec market
[SPEAKER_01]: and both markets will work together very
aligned, I guess, because research and
[SPEAKER_01]: development will be more in the medical
market and experience in the field will be
[SPEAKER_01]: more coming up from rec market because the
volume is much bigger there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm guessing they will have a very,
very certain framework in the rec market
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very, very near by the medical
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after four years, maybe,
and you see what is really going on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: rec market, you can maybe adjust this a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, yeah, this is quite clear
that while there are some great advantages
[SPEAKER_00]: and experiences to gain from pivoting
medical operations to recreation,
[SPEAKER_00]: there does need to be a really clear line
and I think that's been echoed by
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I've been hearing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Boswell, I guess, speaking about the
current medical framework in itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: something you've been working with and
doing activism for over the last 20 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think that the current kind of
pharma framework is meeting the needs of
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and do you think it's easy enough
to have access to the natural remedies and
[SPEAKER_00]: to access the type of products and the
formats the patients want?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can talk for so many about the current
obstacles as severe as maybe in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no medical cannabis approved since
five years, but you can probably find a
[SPEAKER_03]: doctor in Slovenia who will prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if they prescribe it legally,
they can have problems on the medical
[SPEAKER_03]: chambers and they just want to avoid it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem for this medical part,
because I would not mix personal use or
[SPEAKER_03]: so-called recreational use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not recreation, it's a personal use.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have recreational one,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the education is crucial to
get doctors on the cannabis side because
[SPEAKER_03]: they need protocols, they need,
you know, everything around because they,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's a quite individual problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in Slovenia, it's hard to find a doctor
today, even if they can prescribe flowers,
[SPEAKER_03]: they can prescribe everything,
but everything is more or less on Satevex
[SPEAKER_03]: or Dolomyrinol, Dolomyrinol and CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what's allowed by the Slovenian
public agency for drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, we started already four years
ago an educational program together also
[SPEAKER_03]: with the medical chambers of Slovenia and
the nurses' chambers of Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: We organized already actually three
educational courses for doctors and I hope
[SPEAKER_03]: this will bring some changes onto this
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess moving on to kind of what
legalisation means to operators and to
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses themselves, such as a lot of
people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of does legalisation mean to
your stores and people?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one of the things that I find
quite interesting about you guys is you're
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the only kind of businesses that
have got proven revenues from medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a deep understanding of
consumers, both kind of in the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational space overseas alongside in
medical kind of the general space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess from that position, how do you see
things shifted to stores and people and
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you see your consumers and revenues
being affected?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I say, I think we are a little bit
conscious about our expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are already in business, as you
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we are distributing them to more
than 100 countries in a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we are available with what we call
household devices, well-intended uses or
[SPEAKER_02]: chemomime and such things and we have to
make the products with the intended uses
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we think once it's legalised,
of course you will have a push with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will have more information available,
therefore we will surely reach more
[SPEAKER_02]: clients.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't believe that our business
will be skyrocketed because of
[SPEAKER_02]: legalisation in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, as mentioned already,
a good business in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you look to the rest of the
world, of course it can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look to Canada, the experience
there, of course, yeah, there was
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement, but also not too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many times, with legalisation,
it also comes with a lot of regulation
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have not in place before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we cannot in the moment do
advertisement for cannabis, but we can do
[SPEAKER_02]: advertisement with life science stuff and
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once, like in Canada, you are not
allowed, for example, to show your
[SPEAKER_02]: products, or you must bring your products
that are not usable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot turn them on in a shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall we see this legalisation
because governments have so much fear
[SPEAKER_02]: about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they think about all this,
about your protection, about consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end of the day,
you cannot even show where you can get
your cannabis from.
They even think about having the state
distributing in their own shops what you
have in your shop.
In the model of Quebec, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look to Quebec, the government does
it by themselves, and there is,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, no vaporiser available at all
in their shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they don't think this is
necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are only a host of devices
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall, this legalisation also can
come with additional difficulties for the
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall we will have some improvement
in business, but not skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very valuable insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Thomas, you mentioned the product
differences as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference in the kind of portfolio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you expect to see any kind of overlap
of products and suppliers, or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: expect this to be a completely separate
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely separate brands, product
formats?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because as I said at the beginning,
I'm pretty sure that the politics will be
[SPEAKER_01]: very aligned to the foreign market within
the standards of the medical market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty sure you cannot divide
supplier for medical and supplier for red
[SPEAKER_01]: markets to be something in the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to answer the question, I'm pretty
sure that from the product side,
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical market, what I really mean is
you have to develop a real medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: product to get all the doctors on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the moment, I would guess maybe
two, three, four per cent of the doctors
[SPEAKER_01]: in Germany prescribe cannabis and all the
others say, OK, give me some data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, for example, the reason why
we as a company do not hire as much pharma
[SPEAKER_01]: sales guys as we could, because what
should they tell the doctors?
[SPEAKER_01]: They come to the place and say,
yeah, this is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the difference between that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another strain and it has another
turbine profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real data-based medicine standard,
we are far away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we definitely have to put more and more
effort into that to really create a
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal product which more and more
doctors can put in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they are responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I will be a doctor, I will be
very interested in the fact what exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: will happen to my patient when I prescribe
this kind of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the red market when this is
coming up and the topic cannabis as such
[SPEAKER_01]: is spread among the whole society,
I guess that more and more doctors maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: put away their doubts about cannabis and
be more open into and do more research and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this will be a very crucial process
during the whole red market opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I guess, a closing question.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as the impact on companies,
of the industry, at the bottom line is
[SPEAKER_00]: there is quite a big fundamental human
rights question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just any sort of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a human right almost to be able to
consume cannabis and to be able to enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: that as human personal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's been a lot of activism
that's been pioneered and I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been a huge role in getting the medical
market off the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, do you see a place for more
recreational activism?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you think that kind of civil
disobedience in these forms of activity
[SPEAKER_00]: can help to progress the cause and help
achieve some of these aims that we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the use of cannabis especially
for medical purposes is a basic human
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have enough data that we cannot
just ban it and take it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really think we should divide the
medical market and personal use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because for personal use, I think we don't
have to invent hot water again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have regulated alcohol, everything that
is needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have you get shoots because of alcohol
and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just copy paste and I think it's
regulated more than enough alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also domestic use and domestic brewery,
it's very hard to regulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we should apply something
similar for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And medical market rules are completely
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different laws, different approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think we can mix those two
fields in one basket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apple and beers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So unfortunately I have to tell you that
around 15% of Slovenians are losing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we cannot look away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now actually patients are forcing
doctors to prescribe cannabis because
[SPEAKER_03]: patients are also well educated,
especially when they are very sick or they
[SPEAKER_03]: need really help.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in Slovenia, with the survey of the
Faculty of Social Sciences, 30% of
[SPEAKER_03]: oncological patients are also on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is not really good for
credibility of the medical society.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this should be changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the crucial of the personal market or
personal use market is quality control.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have quality control now for the last
eight years and it should really be
[SPEAKER_03]: controlled as it should be for cannabis
because now it's the worst thing where you
[SPEAKER_03]: can buy whatever even if it just looks
like cannabis but it doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_03]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess just wrapping up here as we
are close to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to ask everyone the same
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an ideal scenario where everyone
could win, the industry governments,
[SPEAKER_00]: the recreational users, the patients,
operators?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it's quite a forward question
but in a nutshell, do you think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: possible?
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course it's possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we should invest a little bit more
into education.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just in research because cannabis is
the most researched plant on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we should put more effort into
education and things will change soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect words, I cannot add some more
because education is the crucial point
[SPEAKER_01]: here in this case, especially for cannabis
market and if we achieve to have a very
[SPEAKER_01]: good education base and acceptance within
the society, I think there could be a
[SPEAKER_01]: win-win situation for a relevant place in
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in the centre of the win-win must
be the patient and the consumer,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, for them it's available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the government, it is about to make
it as easy as possible, as low or as few
regulations as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the moment, there's still all this fear
and then, of course, all these things,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can treat this much,
much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look to the countries where
they have legalised it, you see the
[SPEAKER_02]: negative consequences are minimal and they
are definitely lower than the consequences
[SPEAKER_02]: of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say the more liberal the
approach is, the better it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much everyone for coming,
that was the end of the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say a final thank you to
all of the brilliant panelists for their
[SPEAKER_00]: insight.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, I hope to see you again.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
