[SPEAKER_01]: Our next speaker brings a wealth of
knowledge, and he will give you time to
[SPEAKER_01]: get your right translators, because it
will be in English.
[SPEAKER_01]: This man has served in the military.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a trained dentist and lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has studied in the United States at
prestigious universities, including UCLA
[SPEAKER_01]: and Georgetown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's not enough, he has served in
the Hamburg Parliament.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a drug policy spokesperson who does
great work with the Free Democratic Party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please give a warm welcome for Mr. Wieland
Schinnenberg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dear Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen,
unfortunately, we have not enough light
[SPEAKER_04]: here, so I need my glasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you have no problem reading from
the text.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I want to thank you for the
opportunity to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great honor to have this conference
here in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me explain the opinion of the German
Liberal Party, the FDP, concerning
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The repression-based cannabis policy in
Germany has failed.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are various reasons for reaching
this conclusion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Firstly, after decades of
prosecution-centered system, several
[SPEAKER_04]: million people still consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is no success.
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondly, these people have to face
additional risks to their health,
[SPEAKER_04]: since they are forced to obtain cannabis
on the black market, where they are often
[SPEAKER_04]: sold manipulated cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thirdly, the judicial system and police
are burdened unnecessarily with work.
[SPEAKER_04]: These resources could be better used
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, I am much more
scared of bulgaries than of neighbors
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have three daughters, and one of my
greatest worries was always what happens
[SPEAKER_04]: if one of my daughters becomes a drug
addict.
[SPEAKER_04]: I asked myself, what will the state do for
me or my daughter?
[SPEAKER_04]: The answer was black market,
criminalization, prison.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, it was very
unsatisfactory.
[SPEAKER_04]: We in the German Liberal Party,
the FDP, decided some years ago that we
[SPEAKER_04]: want a different kind of drugs policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want regulated dispensation of
cannabis, but I should stress that I mean
[SPEAKER_04]: regulated dispensation, not complete
liberalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not want cannabis to be available on
supermarket shelves.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we want cannabis to be dispensed in
chemists and other specially licensed
[SPEAKER_04]: shops and to be given to adults in
relatively small amounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the arguments in favor of doing
it this way?
[SPEAKER_04]: The first is that this would prevent
people ending up with manipulated
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Checks could be carried out.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second reason is that we would provide
much better contact to the drug addicts
[SPEAKER_04]: and thus also allow us to offer them
treatment more quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: By no longer arresting and persecuting
possession and consumption of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: our state prevents the criminalization of
many people, enhances the efficiency and
[SPEAKER_04]: the effectiveness of our criminal justice
system, and saves capacities and money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but not least, the state would
generate considerable resources which
[SPEAKER_04]: could then be spent on treatment and
prevention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the FDP's
concept.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have been calling for this for three
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Naturally, we are aware of the fact that
there are people in the German Bundestag,
[SPEAKER_04]: our federal parliament, and in many other
parliaments around the world who still are
[SPEAKER_04]: a bit skeptical about the idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is why the FDP is calling for a pilot
project to begin with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see no reason why this should not be
tried out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody can seriously mind becoming wiser.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let us begin with the pilot project,
and once the pilot project has run,
[SPEAKER_04]: we will know whether or how we can work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, let me put it this
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a new policy on drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a people-centric drugs policy as
opposed to the dogmatic one we currently
[SPEAKER_04]: have.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the FDP idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simply put, we need a new generation of
drugs policy and we will continue in
[SPEAKER_04]: demanding an alternative drug policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me adjust some words about the medical
use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not satisfied with the situation of
the medical use in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, for a little more than one year,
we have better regulation at this point,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there are a lot of questions,
and I want to put these questions here.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, why have we not a better tender
procedure You all know that there was just
[SPEAKER_04]: a decision of a German court which stopped
the tender procedure, so the result will
[SPEAKER_04]: be the production of cannabis in Germany
will be postponed for one or two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very unsatisfied.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my question, why couldn't the German
government make a better tender procedure?
[SPEAKER_04]: Second question, why do we need a tender
procedure in Germany?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it not possible that we have just a
licensing procedure in Germany?
[SPEAKER_04]: Every company which is able to produce
good quality and secure measurements
[SPEAKER_04]: should be allowed to produce cannabis in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the third point is how wants Minister
Spahn, Mr. Spahn is the Health Minister in
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany, just came to office a few weeks
ago, how wants Mr. Spahn make sure that we
[SPEAKER_04]: will have enough cannabis for medical use
in fall of this year?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the problem that maybe at the
beginning of August we do not have enough
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last point, the FTP, the German
Liberal Party wants to make sure,
[SPEAKER_04]: wants to make pressure on Mr. Spahn that
we have enough medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this conference can support us in
this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone have any questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm standing in the back.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see me.
[SPEAKER_07]: No one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Has any questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally satisfied.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alex has a question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on a minute.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: You must have been very thorough.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for that speech,
Schienenberg.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was very nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You talk about the rejection of the
licenses recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you also say that one of the
nascent points of going forward with
[SPEAKER_05]: public policy in Germany regarding
domestic license production is that every
[SPEAKER_05]: body, or more people should have a chance,
that it shouldn't be so restrictive in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of the qualifications.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you just talk a little bit more
about that and what you would like to see
[SPEAKER_05]: in terms of inclusivity?
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope I understand your question
correctly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise we'd need maybe a German
translation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I understand that you want to know what
we as a Liberal Party want to have the
[SPEAKER_04]: procedure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our idea is that everyone who needs
medical cannabis should get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need a bigger sum.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have only about three tons,
which on the tender procedure is not
[SPEAKER_04]: enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second point, I do not understand
why almost every medical can be produced
[SPEAKER_04]: by any company which has enough quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Bayer produces aspirin, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aspirin has not been produced by the
state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or under control of the state,
we just have to make sure that the quality
[SPEAKER_04]: is good enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is for aspirin and thousands of
other medical material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not the same system for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to make sure that we have good
cannabis, good quality cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we have control of the production.
[SPEAKER_04]: But any company who makes sure that this
can be made should be allowed to produce
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is my opinion of the opinion of my
party.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we don't need the tender
procedure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a beginning of all the
problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very much too complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me put it this way, Germans and I like
to make it difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thank you for your information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a question about when you talk about
dry flour, everyone always assumes about
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking because you're covering that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about medical devices like
vaporizers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they currently being covered?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that something being talked about
as a way to use less cannabis and also for
[SPEAKER_00]: a much healthier way of using cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everyone's so obsessed with oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very exciting for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of challenges and
variables with oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it takes a lot longer for it to
affect and it lasts for much longer as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to vaporizing, which is almost
instantaneous and for shorter amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you maybe comment on are people
covering for vaporizers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there enough education and
knowledge that talks about the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: flour compared to oils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't ask a politician about too many
details.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a question you should put to
specialists.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my opinion is we have, especially
concerning cannabis, a lack of information
[SPEAKER_04]: in big parts of the German population.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to do with the prosecution system.
[SPEAKER_04]: If something is not allowed, people learn
not enough about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have another policy,
we need, of course, more information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is not the stuff which you can
use like coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need information and the different
kinds of how to get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we hope this will happen in the
process of liberalization or controlled
[SPEAKER_04]: giving to the people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Schinnenburg, Rataichak, if I'm not
mistaken, you're a doctor.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where the doctor comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tooth doctor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tooth doctor.
[SPEAKER_09]: All the better.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know the methods, the progress and
further education in medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: How can we, as lobbyists, for the
criminalization, for the legalization,
[SPEAKER_09]: build up our lobby strengths so that what
Georg Wurth is maybe even a little
[SPEAKER_09]: skittish or afraid of, that we can use it.
[SPEAKER_09]: The same methods, the same mechanics.
[SPEAKER_09]: What recommendations do you have?
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to do it like the people,
the companies that come to me as a member
[SPEAKER_04]: of parliament.
[SPEAKER_04]: A serious, careful information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you offer your information on medical
progress, on medical days?
[SPEAKER_04]: I also know that the responsible chambers
are not necessarily enthusiastic,
[SPEAKER_04]: to put it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to work on it again and again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I receive almost every week a
representative from the field of
[SPEAKER_04]: companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also from the affected.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to listen to that and become
smarter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't have to do that only with
me, but with all politicians and
[SPEAKER_04]: especially with all doctors, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there are still knowledge
deficiencies with some doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they always offer it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have a time when the opinion
about cannabis in society as a whole,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also with doctors, is slowly changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is questioning and 50% of doctors
are already very convinced.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know Max Weber.
[SPEAKER_04]: Politics is Boan de Cabretta.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm already there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't go fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you understood it now with the
translation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a German idiom which I used.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: Martin Weller from Jürgen.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were fortunately one of the companies
that did not go into the narrow selection
[SPEAKER_06]: with the last...
[SPEAKER_06]: ...and we saved all the effort until last
week or two weeks to be thrown out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But overall, my question is, as a
politician, could you explain a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: the political, let's say, viewpoints of
the various parties and how things are
[SPEAKER_06]: moving, A, to overall the growth of
growing of legalized medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: And A, also, any political tendencies of
the various parties towards recreational
[SPEAKER_06]: use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was the question, which party has which
position?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to understand, we know of the various
parties and just to have a better
[SPEAKER_06]: understanding where the stand is of the
various parties.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have a feeling of what's the
likelihood of things happening in the
[SPEAKER_06]: future.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my party, the Liberal Party,
has the idea of the pilot project.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are supported by the Greens and also by
the left-wing party.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, we have the
Conservative Party, the CDU of Chancellor
[SPEAKER_04]: Merkel, and the AfD, the far right-wing
party.
[SPEAKER_04]: These two are opposing to our opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And remaining is the Social Democratic
Party.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are a little bit divided.
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of the SPD is on our side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can't put all this together,
we would have a majority in the German
[SPEAKER_04]: Bundestag for our idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the members of parliament would be free
to decide according to their opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, we have a coalition of the
Conservatives and the Social Democrats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we fear that the Social Democrats will
sacrifice the new drug policy to the
[SPEAKER_04]: discipline in the coalition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will see it on the end of June or
early July.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have it in the special department
of the parliament when we discuss this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we will see how the Social Democrats
will decide.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you just ask all one of the 700
deputies in the parliament, everyone could
[SPEAKER_04]: decide on its own.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would have a majority for our idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I fear as part of the coalition we
have for some weeks now in Germany,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Social Democrats are not very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, I'm going to post a question in
German, so it's easier for me and for him,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, regarding politics, from the
outside, just from the outside,
[SPEAKER_02]: I always ask myself, is it really wanted?
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, they have a party program,
the left too, the green too, so I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: informed about that, I know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I come from a state,
Baden-Württemberg, which has, unusually,
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, got a green state government after
Fukushima.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my state is one of the most
discriminatory with Bavaria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even on the state level, nothing is
done at all, on the contrary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The prosecution has increased,
the death of drugs by legal means,
[SPEAKER_02]: Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria are equally
well on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really really wanted?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you see a realistic chance within
the next 10 years that it will develop at
[SPEAKER_02]: all in a positive way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because my impression is that the decision
to release medical cannabis, only because
[SPEAKER_02]: of that, because of the court judgment in
Cologne, and it was clear, if it is
[SPEAKER_02]: decided by the Supreme Court, it flies
around your ears.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if a decision is made with 100
percent, it has, as they say in our
[SPEAKER_02]: country, also always tasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you were so in agreement, because you
knew, either you decide something now,
[SPEAKER_02]: or someone else decides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since the path has been chosen,
I just wanted to hear your assessment,
[SPEAKER_02]: away from applications, should something
really happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will something happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Away from legalization, import and so on,
at least a final criminalization is
[SPEAKER_02]: something realistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have the impression,
that it will be more open on the state
[SPEAKER_02]: level, but actually on the completion
level, more and more tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you follow the press of the last
three months, so many cannabis plantations
[SPEAKER_02]: have gone up in Germany, as I think the
last ten years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is obviously also a pressure and
the desire to make it stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, it was a bit much all of a
sudden, but maybe, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the important question, what do I
think, purely speculative, will there be a
[SPEAKER_04]: huge improvement in the next ten years?
[SPEAKER_04]: My answer is clearly yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ask me, in this election period of
the Bundestag, the answer is probably no.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you ask after ten years,
the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ask me further, how can it be that
if in fact in society, also in medicine,
[SPEAKER_04]: there is a certain development,
how can it be that criminal prosecution
[SPEAKER_04]: authorities, let's say, are not conducive?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to make it very friendly,
as you have described it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it does not surprise me, because in
these areas, criminal prosecution
[SPEAKER_04]: authorities tend to work with people who
have different ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you may know, that the Federal Office
of German Criminal Officers is very on our
[SPEAKER_04]: side, for the reason that I have already
mentioned, that they would like to use
[SPEAKER_04]: their time to pursue housing violations
and not cannabis plantations or cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: dealers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is a bit of a tendency in the
administration, there is the primacy of
[SPEAKER_04]: politics, that is, if the Parliament
decides, we want to do it this way or that
[SPEAKER_04]: way, we actually have the administration
to execute it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there is a bit of a tendency,
we know it better than the stupid members
[SPEAKER_04]: of parliament, and that's why we do it
differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go back to the subject of expulsion.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were sold as, let's say, dilettantism.
[SPEAKER_04]: The expulsion was not done well.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you had asked me the question,
I'm going to talk cryptically,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you had asked me the question,
tell me, Mr. Schindburg, was it really
[SPEAKER_04]: dilettantism?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or did you want to be dilettant in order
for it to fail?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I would not be able to deny the
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a bit cryptic, but I'm not sure,
and I've shared that with the press,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure whether the expulsion of
dilettantism, which has failed the
[SPEAKER_04]: officials, or whether they were a bit
stupid on purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are claims that you can't deny,
but it wouldn't surprise me if that was
the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I said, Mr. Spahn, who was also
in the newspaper last week, Mr. Stahnen,
[SPEAKER_04]: take care of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's going back to the left.
[SPEAKER_06]: No political question, but because we have
a dentist up here, just a short question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know why dentists are not allowed
to prescribe cannabis or other drugs as a
[SPEAKER_06]: single group of doctors?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was still studying, I did 84 dental
medical exams, and we were still allowed
to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were also given instructions on the use
of drug recipes, and that was so
[SPEAKER_04]: complicated and so dangerous that I said
to myself back then, I will never
[SPEAKER_04]: prescribe anything, I've never done
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But back then we were still allowed to do
it, and at some point it was removed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It certainly has to do with the fact that
teeth pain is generally not treated with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably the reason for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have prescribed cannabis for 28
years, but I've never had a treatment with
[SPEAKER_04]: a recipe, because you know the maintenance
duties, the control duties, and I thought,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh god, oh god, oh god.
[SPEAKER_04]: I decided in my exam, you don't prescribe
any BTM, not only cannabis, but also
[SPEAKER_04]: others, even though I was allowed to do it
back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned how to do it, but I didn't know
the cause, because it's a huge drug
[SPEAKER_04]: cartilage.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, are there any more questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just gonna go right to it?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there another question?
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, this has got to be the first time
that a politician has gone short.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over where?
[SPEAKER_07]: Over there, I'm on my way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is, what's the motive of the
CDU and the far-right party to be against
[SPEAKER_03]: further legalization?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it popularism?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it really that their popular base is
against it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the, or the farmer, big farmer,
what's the real interest behind all of
[SPEAKER_03]: this?
[SPEAKER_04]: You have put two questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first is, what are the arguments,
the name, and the other, what is the real
[SPEAKER_04]: reason?
[SPEAKER_04]: The arguments are, cannabis is bad,
and if the state must prosecute everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: to make the sign that cannabis is
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have any kind of liberalization,
the state says, oh, well, it's not that
[SPEAKER_04]: bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't share this opinion, but this is
the official reason they don't support our
[SPEAKER_04]: idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ask for the real reason,
I think it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The conservative parties, the CDU and also
the AFD, represent, let's say,
[SPEAKER_04]: people in Germany who are more
conservative.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are a bit anxious, oh, it's somehow
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just an emotional idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to change anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Conservative parties don't want to change
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is, in my opinion, the real reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it again for Dr. Schinnenberg.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very informative.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
