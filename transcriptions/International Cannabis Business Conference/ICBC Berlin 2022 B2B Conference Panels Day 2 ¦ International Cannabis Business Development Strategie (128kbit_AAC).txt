[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, we're going to jump right in,
since we're starting late.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know you're all anxious to get out
of here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So first, what we're going to do is a
round of introductions.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I have some questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know there were some audience
questions that were sent to us on Hooba.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to cover those as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would like to start with George
Stanchion.
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you introduce yourself, please?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is George Stanchion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the CEO of Commerc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commerc has been in the botanical space
for 25 years, building systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities for various botanical
extractions in the flavor and fragrance
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last seven years, we created the Brown
Q5, and we built machines for the Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been mainly in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have offices in Europe and a number of
offices in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been mainly in the US market in
the last seven years.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things I guess I should have
started with is saying, our whole panel is
[SPEAKER_10]: going to talk about business development
and expanding your business in a
[SPEAKER_10]: multinational framework, from either the
US into Europe, or if you're coming from
[SPEAKER_10]: Colombia into Europe.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the panelists that we have here are
all coming out of a different,
[SPEAKER_10]: unique perspective on an international
expansion.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things I'd like to mention
about George here that just introduced
[SPEAKER_10]: himself, he's been extracting flavor and
fragrance for 25 years out of Bulgaria,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is like one of the leaders in the
lavender world.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a man that has extraction
experience that far exceeds cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he's coming in and has also gone from
Europe to America.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he's got a very unique perspective on
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: The next person I want to introduce to you
is George Terry.
[SPEAKER_10]: George, tell them about your expertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm the executive vice president of RAD
Source Industries Technologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually the number one X-ray blood
irradiator in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've got 300 plus radiators in the
field, including the Australian Red Cross,
[SPEAKER_04]: the American Red Cross, most of the
countries across the globe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've expanded the same technology
into cannabis about going out four years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been in multiple sites throughout
the US and Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everywhere from the smallest group,
startup, all the way up to the big
[SPEAKER_04]: operators.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've seen a lot of good things,
a lot of bad things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm here to share some of that
experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Darren?
[SPEAKER_07]: Darren McDonald.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the CEO of Cookie Jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cookie Jar is based out of Ottawa,
Ontario, Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: We specialize in premium glass aftermarket
storage solutions, as well as packaging.
[SPEAKER_07]: Aside from our storage, we do have a
digital platform.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a data play with our digital app
at the consumer level that tracks usage,
[SPEAKER_07]: reviews of different brands and strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that can be shared on the B2B site.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jessica?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm CEO, founder, and chair of Acurna,
the first cannabis technology company to
[SPEAKER_02]: list on NASDAQ.
[SPEAKER_02]: We invented seed-to-sale tracking 12 and a
half years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, we provide a global technology
ecosystem for cannabis that is the
[SPEAKER_02]: backbone upon which the industry is built,
enabling regulation, compliance,
[SPEAKER_02]: taxation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to date, we've tracked more than $30
billion of legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to dive right in.
[SPEAKER_10]: And while we're doing this, I would like
you guys to start thinking about
[SPEAKER_10]: questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: If there's time at the end, we're going to
take some audience questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got a wealth of information up
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all looking to jump into this
European market and excited about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you've got experts up here who've done
this work.
[SPEAKER_10]: So George, how do you see the European
market evolving over the next five years?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: European market is very dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many countries involved into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this topic over here is about
strategies, global strategies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the environment, which is a very,
very interesting overview on what's really
[SPEAKER_00]: going to happen in five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diversity in Europe, we first need to
know our class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing what people want, we can put
together every product they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how I see that market, I see big
pharma getting into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no limitation for big pharma in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like United States, we have some
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Europe, big pharma is going to come
big way as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big pharma thinks about this industry
is pure ingredients, isolated ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: that they could put some drugs around it
and provide that to the medical market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how everybody else can survive around
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is going to be another market
which people are going to be after.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much the boutique market.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing right now, growing nice
trains, getting pure extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the word pure is going to be very
important here in the next market
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to be focused on real
ecologically grown ingredients and
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted in the least hazardous way with
least harmful solvents and delivered in
[SPEAKER_00]: the most natural important form to the
customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's going to be a boutique real
boutique market that's going to overcome
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that big pharma is going to be
pushing also to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we have to know very well the
laws in each country and be able to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it real global.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make it real global, now example with
German market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping extraction is going to be
legal next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's going to be pushed
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to decide what to do with the
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we know that our market is in
Germany, we have to do the extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere that's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, Czech Republic or somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then where we grow, of course,
we should grow good trains that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: cost prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can pick up pretty much a global
international European business that by
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing our customer deliver the best
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to have this customer
returning back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in five years, we really have to be
able to deliver the best organic natural
[SPEAKER_00]: products for the customer in a most
natural way.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you're right about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: The sort of prevailing opinion that I've
heard since, you know, coming here for the
[SPEAKER_10]: last couple of days has been that
Europeans are already connoisseurs of
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that, I mean, think about the wine
connoisseur they have, they want the Pinot
[SPEAKER_10]: or they want the Sauvignon Blanc or
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone has their different flavor.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so then your boutique market comment
is that people are going to want what they
[SPEAKER_10]: want and the market needs to provide it
for them in a quality way with flavor and
[SPEAKER_10]: the effects that they want.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it isn't just a medical experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to become, you know,
this tastemaker thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the European market is different than
America in the sense that, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard everyone talking today about the
love of hash in this market, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you're talking about concentration.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the fact that you've got to go where
you can operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'm looking at the cannabis,
boutique cannabis market as gourmet
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, like your extraction vessel is
like a pressure cooker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cook your own recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take over, like you can offer
people flavors, experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you get that market
followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ali, I don't know if any of you guys know
we're here when Ali was on the moderating
[SPEAKER_10]: panel and he said grapes are a commodity,
but wine is a product.
[SPEAKER_10]: But cannabis is unique because it's both.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a commodity and a CPG product.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's an interesting concept.
[SPEAKER_10]: George Terry, talk to us about what some
of the lessons are that you've learned.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've said you've been in hundreds of
facilities, big ones, small ones across
[SPEAKER_10]: the globe.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are some of the lessons that you've
learned about startup strategies?
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you can dovetail on what George
here said, in terms of knowing that in
[SPEAKER_10]: five years we expect the cannabis market
to be one of a sort of gourmet
[SPEAKER_10]: connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what are some of the things that you
could give people that are wanting to
[SPEAKER_10]: start up here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I agree about the regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to know your regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not just what you guess or what you
think, but have them run if you need to
[SPEAKER_04]: get out of the solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Regulations change at the whim of the
local regulators.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes they'll go in one direction and
then they'll switch to another direction,
[SPEAKER_04]: even testing regulations as far as the
product is concerned.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mandates that might be local,
federal, or even countrywide.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is something that's big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also too, what I find is, I told the guys
prior to this, there's two types of people
[SPEAKER_04]: I find in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those that have been fooled and those that
are about to be fooled.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason I say that is because when
people come into the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: they automatically assume that it's not as
professional as an industry as it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they think that they can sell snake
oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: A, I'm going to try to bring this product
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might work in another area,
like food, or it might work in the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: world.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not really working in the
cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even in my experience of my product,
we do a radiator that's on-site.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a direct replacement for gamma.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other technologies that are out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 50% of my customer base is people that
have tried other failed technologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we give them a card and we say,
we'll hear from you in a couple months.
[SPEAKER_04]: We always hear back from them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So check out your vendors, check out your
technologies, talk to people, get
[SPEAKER_04]: references.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because once you go in and you invest in
the technology, and whether that's a
[SPEAKER_04]: technology that's going to get you through
cultivation or grow or veg or anything
[SPEAKER_04]: like that, you got to make sure that,
or lighting solution, talk to people that
[SPEAKER_04]: are in your same boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: That you're either in a startup or when
they started, what lessons did they find
[SPEAKER_04]: out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they learn early on about that
product?
[SPEAKER_04]: What did it impact on their crop?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had customers that they've gone out
with other technologies on the cultivation
[SPEAKER_04]: side on decontamination.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's turned all their product yellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it dried it up, or it turned it all
soft and squishy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It ruined their whole crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: $500,000 worth of product, gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they have to turn it to extract and
they get 20 cents on the dollar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had they talked to other people,
other people did a little bit of research
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're going to save themselves a lot
of time and money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my big thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Know your competitors, be friendly with
your competitors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Friendly competition is fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But be careful with what you control and
check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Consider ourselves competitors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Consider ourselves colleagues.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we help each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: We call each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think developing a network where you
can be friendly with the people who are
[SPEAKER_10]: doing exactly what you're doing,
I think that's really smart.
[SPEAKER_10]: In a perfect world, I hate to hear that
people have to irradiate their flower.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like in a perfect world, they should be
able to grow clean cannabis and not need
[SPEAKER_10]: to irradiate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the regulations are so stringent that
sometimes I guess that's required.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's required because people die.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's the market that says,
oh, this should be organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what, guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got people, and I can name multiple
people, where they come in and we go and
[SPEAKER_04]: we talk to them and they say, I don't need
your machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any problem with mold or
mildew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we say, here's a card.
[SPEAKER_04]: And six months later, they call us and
say, I need it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what happens is the season
changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oyster comes in and it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm dealing with a situation now in one
of the states.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I say, everything should be clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the real world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even stuff that you buy that's food based,
people get sick from organic food too.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's pathogens that might be there or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter what, in this world,
we're full of germs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's at the end, do you want to be
able to address those germs?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's nice when you don't have to,
but you always need a backup plan that's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be able to address that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because some people cannot accept those
type of pathogens in their bodies.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will kill them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I always say, bad news does not get better
with time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And some people don't want to hear the bad
news that their weed isn't great.
[SPEAKER_10]: So just assume that maybe you'll have one
bad crop and be prepared.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to switch to Darian.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to switch gears a little bit
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because one of the things that we're
talking about is an emerging market.
[SPEAKER_10]: So George talked about the fact that
what's going to happen in the next five
[SPEAKER_10]: years is it's going to evolve into this
boutique market.
[SPEAKER_10]: But where we're at right now, everybody's
chomping at the bit to get started because
[SPEAKER_10]: we're the medical in Europe.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all patiently waiting for Germany to
go wreck.
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to know, Darian, what are your
thoughts on having a first mover
[SPEAKER_10]: advantage?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it an advantage?
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting to market first?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great question, Jamie.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think on paper, being early to
market shows a lot of advantages to any
[SPEAKER_07]: business.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's immediate market share.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's quick brand recognition.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as we've seen in the Canadian market
over the last four plus years,
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of the first to market actually
faltered in many weeks and proved to be
[SPEAKER_07]: very costly, both from brand recognition.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they didn't have deep pockets or other
capital, they went out of business.
[SPEAKER_07]: So quite frankly, I think the best
approach is become an expert in your
[SPEAKER_07]: backyard first before you start exploring,
playing with your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're ready to go to the next market
on an international level, I think it's
[SPEAKER_07]: extremely important to do your research,
whether that's through focus groups,
[SPEAKER_07]: consultants, utilizing your network to
learn what George said with learn the
[SPEAKER_07]: policies, learn the regulations before you
jump into that market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as we've seen just this week,
every country is very, very different on
[SPEAKER_07]: their expectation and what the rules and
regulations are.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that to answer your question,
Jamie, as long as you're using your brains
[SPEAKER_07]: and your experience before speed,
and you have the proper game plan before
[SPEAKER_07]: you actually go to that next market,
I don't see it being advantageous unless
[SPEAKER_07]: you're truly prepared to tackle that
market.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's piggyback on that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's say that you've got, as an example
with George, you're having 25 years of
[SPEAKER_10]: extraction experience, not necessarily
cannabis, but now he has cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're saying rely on your business
expertise because I think there's people
[SPEAKER_10]: in this room and I've met people at this
conference that are intrigued about the
[SPEAKER_10]: industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have no experience in their backyard
because this is their backyard and it
[SPEAKER_10]: doesn't exist yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: So how do they go use their brains and go
get themselves prepared?
[SPEAKER_10]: So are you suggesting perhaps that they
wait to enter or are you suggesting that
[SPEAKER_10]: there's a way for them to do that due
diligence to get prepared?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think going back to the comment on
utilizing, whether it's a consulting firm
[SPEAKER_07]: or focus groups, as I mentioned,
educate yourself and get yourself ready.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying don't necessarily enter
that market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just be prepared to become an expert in
that market as you dive into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: From experience with Cookie Jar,
we actually utilize consultants before we
[SPEAKER_07]: even entered our own market.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we entered the market in 2018 when it
became federally legal, I think we would
[SPEAKER_07]: have fallen flat on our face, to be quite
honest, because the timing wasn't right
[SPEAKER_07]: for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: As we expanded and the Canadian market
became an expert, then we focused on the U
[SPEAKER_07]: .S.
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where we are today is now we're trying to
explore the European market.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just doing your due diligence,
educating yourself, educating your team,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then educating the market as you're
ready to enter that space.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's like what George Terry said?
[SPEAKER_10]: Know your reds, be prepared, be careful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Jessica, you have, I think, what,
12 years of experience in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: industry, pioneer, if not the first
company to go public on the NASDAQ.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all sitting with greatness here.
[SPEAKER_10]: You should all be really proud of ICPC for
getting her to get on an airplane.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm excited to be on this panel with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are some of the foundational
strategies with all of that experience?
[SPEAKER_10]: Talking to this room, what are some of the
foundational strategies that you could
[SPEAKER_10]: give us little nuggets of information to
help people be prepared as they decide if
[SPEAKER_10]: they do want to jump into this emerging
market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that, and I do have to say,
ICPC, whoever's listening, having Jamie as
[SPEAKER_02]: the moderator was a nice big draw.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, let's say you are going to
jump into a new emerging market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the basics, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Focus on foundational items.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to think of them as the three P's.
[SPEAKER_02]: People, products, process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hire the right people, put them in the
right seats on the bus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Products.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an interesting one and maybe a
little bit of a, hey, a tip from the
[SPEAKER_02]: future for all of us who come from the
future who've been in this for over a
[SPEAKER_02]: decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the biggest mistakes that we see
early businesses do is they try to either
[SPEAKER_02]: grow too many strains or carry too many
products in their retail location.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you are starting out in
business, really focusing, focusing on
[SPEAKER_02]: which products am I going to carry and or
produce and which ones can I do well and
[SPEAKER_02]: at a price point that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then third, and I would say arguably
the most important, is process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Setting up your processes ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Focusing on compliance and selecting
software technology that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: support that compliance because compliance
is table stakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't, literally you cannot remain in
business without it because you won't keep
[SPEAKER_02]: your license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And selecting a vendor software technology
that can scale with you and grow as you
[SPEAKER_02]: grow so that you're not taking on
something that's too big when you start
[SPEAKER_02]: but that you're also not starting with
something that's so lightweight that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to abandon it and pay to reinstall
over and over through the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are my tips.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good advice.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, you know, I came out of real
estate and I experienced that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We bought a cheap property management
software and thought, oh, this will get us
[SPEAKER_10]: through.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we grew and then we had to
actually integrate all that data into a
[SPEAKER_10]: new software and it was way more expensive
had we just bought the expensive one the
[SPEAKER_10]: first time.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like if you don't have time to do it right
the first time, you're going to find time
[SPEAKER_10]: to do it again and clean it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that was really good advice.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I have a girlfriend who's a CEO
coach and she always says, right buds in
[SPEAKER_10]: the right seats.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to hire the right people.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had a couple of questions from the
audience prior on the Whova app and we're
[SPEAKER_10]: going to jump into those and then we're
going to open the panel up for questions
[SPEAKER_10]: from the audience.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the first question we got was somebody
who said they're curious about the
[SPEAKER_10]: multi-state operators that are operating,
the big companies that are in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: What was our opinion about them trying to
come into the European market?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, George, will you take that first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a real dungeon to the small
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I can give an example with the
Arizona marijuana market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Arizona is a very unique marijuana
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has licenses which are drawn by
lottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have like 160 licenses and no more
than that, at least in the next couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have, let's say, 35 vape companies
in there, 35 brands which are local.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are a lot of thousand California
vape brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least 10 of them are huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So them getting into the Arizona space,
that's going to wipe out everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the situation here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to be conscious about what exactly
comes to this market and be prepared to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are really two ways to do
successful strategy in this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way is like the business book says,
first learn who's doing it and copy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the second is see what your customer
wants and evaluate your market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make your metrics, but not how much you
want to spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much your market is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then build your strategy from the back
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then divide the numbers by two for
sales and multiply your numbers that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're going to get probably the
right numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you prepare yourself for a
fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most successful fight is how many
customers are going to buy from you every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_10]: I always say the commodity in cannabis is
the shelf.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we're fighting for is shelf
space.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ultimately, that end product ends up on a
shelf in a store somewhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I always tell people that ask me
to consult with them is you have to start
[SPEAKER_10]: with the shelf.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because lots of people are like,
ooh, I'm going to go grow weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be so much fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or I'm going to make a product.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be so great.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they have a great weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or they have a great product.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they're like, now what?
[SPEAKER_10]: They got to go sell it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You really want to have those orders.
[SPEAKER_10]: That goes to Jessica's point.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want to grow 15 strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the strains that people want?
[SPEAKER_10]: Or what's the niche that's missing in the
market?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you've got to go fill that niche.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to start with your shelf in
mind exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: But Jessica, can you elaborate on George's
point?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you've got the 12 years of
experience in the United States market.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if people like George believe that it's
a danger to the small operator,
[SPEAKER_10]: and there's probably truth to that,
we're watching it in different states or
[SPEAKER_10]: managing it differently, what are some of
the things that we could do in Europe here
[SPEAKER_10]: to protect that small operator?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the only long-term viable answer
to that is really regulatory or
[SPEAKER_02]: legislative in some way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we certainly see this in some US
states where the states have looked at
[SPEAKER_02]: other states.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've said, we're going to make sure
that our licenses are awarded to residents
[SPEAKER_02]: of the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a residency requirement.
[SPEAKER_02]: To gain the license, often those residents
and resident businesses will still partner
[SPEAKER_02]: with a multi-state operator, larger entity
from another state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're still ensuring some local
business and some local ownership.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly for our multi-country
clients, of course, Canada having quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: nice advantage being the first G7 country
to fully federally legalize, we do see a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of multi-country operators operating
out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're beginning to get these tow-hold
licenses in different markets and in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombia, Latin America, with the
intention to hopefully export to Europe
[SPEAKER_02]: and then European licenses to anchor that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think in addition to the countries
wanting to enable the economic benefits of
[SPEAKER_02]: putting those licenses, requiring them to
be held by local residents, I also think
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a benefit that's not talked about
for the multi-country operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even when it's not required,
there is a benefit to partner with local
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses, local residents who know the
market, who know the end consumer and who
[SPEAKER_02]: know the nuances there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, for sure, you need boots on the
ground, that intimate knowledge of the
[SPEAKER_10]: market, which actually ties really nicely
into the second question that came from
[SPEAKER_10]: the audience on Hoover.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a person that said they provide
climatization materials to both indoor and
[SPEAKER_10]: outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they wanted to know, well,
I'm just going to summarize the question
[SPEAKER_10]: by saying they're feeling very impatient
because they have to wait because we're
[SPEAKER_10]: not ready yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what can people who are anxious to get
here, what can they do while they're
[SPEAKER_10]: waiting?
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the estimates have been,
most of them, and let me take a poll here.
[SPEAKER_10]: How many of you think that it's going to
be mid 2024 before we're going to see
[SPEAKER_10]: actual adult use sales in Germany?
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, quite a number of you.
[SPEAKER_10]: How many of you think it'll be sooner?
[SPEAKER_10]: A few people.
[SPEAKER_10]: How many of you think it'll be 2025
because they're just going to mess it all
[SPEAKER_10]: up?
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so a few of you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's a great example of we don't
know.
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be next year, it could be the
year after, it could be the year after
[SPEAKER_10]: that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the meantime, we've got all these
people excited to get in the market.
[SPEAKER_10]: What can people do in the meantime?
[SPEAKER_10]: They're waiting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go for it, Darren.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think I don't know too many
governments that make decisions very
[SPEAKER_07]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they do, it's not always the right
decision to go down the right path.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's extremely important to make
sure you stay as close as you can with the
[SPEAKER_07]: government to understand what those rules
and regulations are to make sure that
[SPEAKER_07]: you're set up for success when they do
make that decision.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of people talk about
educating the industry in a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: different facets.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just as important to educate
the government on what we feel is the
[SPEAKER_07]: proper way of doing things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's extremely important to look
at some of the countries that have
[SPEAKER_07]: legalized federal on what's gone well,
what hasn't gone well, how can we learn
[SPEAKER_07]: from this?
[SPEAKER_07]: And when that particular market's ready to
go, they won't make the same mistakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the first key step is actually
legalizing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we can educate our governments on
the best way to do it, I think that'll
[SPEAKER_07]: help expedite the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and just piggybacking on what Darren
said, regulators are there for public
[SPEAKER_04]: safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're there to make sure the
public is protected, whether it's for a
[SPEAKER_04]: safety reason or just so that they don't
get scammed or they're not poisoned.
[SPEAKER_04]: But regulators are relying on you,
like what he was saying, in order to give
[SPEAKER_04]: them the right information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, these are people that come in,
they might not necessarily be from the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry themselves, and they are looking
for hard facts.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not looking for conjecture or
they're not looking for what your opinion
[SPEAKER_04]: is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're able to provide these
regulators with hard facts, you're able to
[SPEAKER_04]: help shape the regulations in your area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've seen that a lot, where people go
into these regulators.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sit with a lot of state regulators,
a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the information that they gather from
different sources helps them shape the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations for either that state,
whether it's a federal thing or a country
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be as open and honest with your
regulators.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't try to snow them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them the hard fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give them your opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them facts so that they can draw
their own opinions on what they think will
[SPEAKER_04]: help them with public safety.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_10]: Raise your hand if you are in contact with
a local, state, federal or land regulator.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say thank you because
George is right.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is going to require us educating the
lawmakers because they don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, the real estate example is you buy
a house, you get an inspector.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if the inspector was a former
electrician, they're going to come in and
[SPEAKER_10]: find all the electrical problems and they
don't know shit about plumbing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, all these legislators came out of
somewhere and they know they're one trip
[SPEAKER_10]: ponies.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, none of them have come out of
cannabis because it's brand new.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's on us to go to them and help them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Help them understand what needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things I can tell you is from
the standpoint of international cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: business development strategies,
education of regulators is a huge
[SPEAKER_10]: component of a strategy because you can
take their order.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do they want?
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to keep the consumer safe.
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to keep the constituents happy
with them.
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to raise tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have all of these different competing
agendas.
[SPEAKER_10]: What we need to help them understand is
how can they craft a win-win?
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of the examples is earlier we
talked about how there's this big appetite
[SPEAKER_10]: for hash in Europe.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, is hash even in the agenda right
now?
[SPEAKER_10]: Legislators always approach things with
fear as their motivator.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we got to keep people safe.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to make sure we're going to limit
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to limit that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to tax it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to make sure there's not
enough licenses.
[SPEAKER_10]: But Whitney just gave a presentation and
talked about what the demand is going to
[SPEAKER_10]: be in Germany when it goes wreck.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to tell you right now,
they're not going to meet it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to sell out immediately.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we teach our legislators to learn
from what's happened in the last,
[SPEAKER_10]: what is it, 22 years of cannabis in
America?
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone want to take that?
[SPEAKER_10]: First, it starts by organizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to put on my chair USCC hat
right now, the US Cannabis Council,
[SPEAKER_02]: and really forming a trade association,
the folks just before us, speaking on
[SPEAKER_02]: behalf of a European-based trade
organization, pooling your voice so that
[SPEAKER_02]: your regulators are hearing one voice,
really hiring some folks who are really
[SPEAKER_02]: great at policy, helping to write that
policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end of the day,
public regulators care about three things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They care about public safety,
product safety, and patient or consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: safety, and ensuring that you're speaking
to the things that they care about.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we going to protect the public?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we going to protect from illicit
sources?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we going to ensure that the
products are safe?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we going to ensure that the
patients and the consumers can purchase
[SPEAKER_02]: safely?
[SPEAKER_10]: From a bid-step standpoint, you're out
here trying to develop business strategies
[SPEAKER_10]: to get your products or your grow or raise
money or whatever it is you're doing at
[SPEAKER_10]: your corporate level.
[SPEAKER_10]: But none of that happens if your business
isn't going to be viable because we don't
[SPEAKER_10]: have the right legislation in place.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys, this is a very ripe opportunity
because they haven't written the regs yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I would also say is please put in
your budgets money for the people that are
[SPEAKER_10]: out there lobbying because if you can help
fund them and start speaking with one
[SPEAKER_10]: voice, as an industry, if we can start
speaking with one voice, we will become
[SPEAKER_10]: more powerful.
[SPEAKER_10]: George, I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: So right now you're based out of where?
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you're doing business in the US.
[SPEAKER_10]: The headquarters are in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_10]: In Arizona.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have also California, Oregon,
Colorado, Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when you see all the different
regulations that are at a state level
[SPEAKER_10]: because we don't have any federal
legalization in the US and we're starting
[SPEAKER_10]: to see the same thing happen here in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's medical in Germany, there's
medical in Italy, there's medical in
[SPEAKER_10]: France, but no EU legislation.
[SPEAKER_10]: What would the advice be if you could rub
the genies bottle and a legislator could
[SPEAKER_10]: pop out?
[SPEAKER_10]: What would the advice be that you would
give them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe US is at least five years
ahead in that legislation and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: trade associations in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been through all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been talking to senators,
they've been talking to mayors,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been talking to local authorities,
to experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that system has been already
implemented, especially in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big movement and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to connect those organizations
and European trade association to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: from all the success that was done and how
eventually that was done in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have any questions in the audience?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it for the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll turn it on.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Step one, plug it in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Step two, turn it on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone has questions?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a pretty open-ended question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious what perspectives you have on
the development of an international
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis market, what benefits it might
provide, what risks it might contain,
[SPEAKER_03]: and how it ought to be phased in in a way
that maximizes the benefits for a diverse
[SPEAKER_03]: and broad cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you clarify what you mean by an
international cannabis market?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one in which countries can trade with
one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just talking about the patchwork
of regulations in the states.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the differences between the countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one that resembles trade for other
commodities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when that might take effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we talked about cannabis
connoisseurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't wait to go and buy the
equivalent of what I'm able to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: coffee.
[SPEAKER_09]: I say that all the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to buy some Moroccan hash at
my local place, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just hop in, get a Spanish haze,
get some Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then dervish poison for the next week
when you want something a little
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to manifest it as an organization
here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So everyone in this room, just put that
picture in your mind and then think about
[SPEAKER_10]: all that power we would have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I say though, on the pro side,
from an environmental perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: purely environmental perspective,
it would be great to grow cannabis where
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lower cost for production than
where much of it is grown today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also a lot has been invested in
growing it in places that are maybe not
[SPEAKER_02]: the most naturally where houses in Canada,
for example, just saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to prohibit regulation
for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what even from a medicinal side to,
you know, I might have somebody who's
[SPEAKER_04]: sitting in Europe that there might be a
medicine that's grown in the US or maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: in Colombia or something that might be
better for their condition, but they can't
[SPEAKER_04]: get it because of regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think a bigger global market will
eventually help the patient to get the
[SPEAKER_04]: right medicine that they need in order to
address whatever condition that they might
[SPEAKER_04]: be using it for.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, from my perspective, I would love to
have one manufacturing facility for Bang
[SPEAKER_10]: Chocolate and then just ship it all over
the world and not have to have 50
[SPEAKER_10]: different ones or, you know, one in
Canada, one in, you know, you get it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's inefficient and it makes companies
less profitable.
[SPEAKER_10]: Beau, what's up?
[SPEAKER_08]: In some of my analysis, the biggest
markets economically are North America and
[SPEAKER_08]: you.
[SPEAKER_08]: But from a consumer perspective,
the larger markets are in Asia and Africa.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what advice do you have any
observations on how to engage the Asian
[SPEAKER_08]: and African markets in addition to the US
and North American markets?
[SPEAKER_10]: You're way out of my expertise.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone here want to talk about Asia?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's regulatory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of these areas, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in some of these places,
if you even say CBE or you say PC,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're good luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so those markets firstly have to
they have to understand the benefits of
[SPEAKER_04]: the CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took a while in the US, you know,
of understanding what the actual benefits
[SPEAKER_04]: are medicinally and for even the
recreational market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once the culture accepts it and there's
enough so it comes through education,
[SPEAKER_04]: through education, the legislatures,
through things like with justice,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, with the with the Chamber of
Commerce, then eventually they're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in Thailand, they're actually,
you know, we're actually talking with some
[SPEAKER_04]: people in Thailand right now, which,
you know, three years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some countries, you're just not going
to walk in and say, you know, hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right to the clink.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could just think that for everywhere,
it's a good source of new revenue.
[SPEAKER_10]: Normally, which is monopoly money,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: We go, oh, this year it's the Republicans.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to give it to the,
you know, the military.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, this year it's the Democrats.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to give it to education.
[SPEAKER_10]: Same dollar.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just move it back and forth on the
board.
[SPEAKER_10]: But cannabis is bringing new dollars to
the table and into the budget.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I can see these emerging markets being
really excited about having new dollars.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that also leads to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're up here over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_09]: Up to your left.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it's on Gaio.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, what's up?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, a lot of these cultures and the
way capitalism works all the time is
[SPEAKER_09]: people see the opportunity for new dollars
and they don't really want to spread it
[SPEAKER_09]: around.
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to see a way to create a
monopoly for themselves to hold onto those
[SPEAKER_09]: new dollars, especially in a lot of
countries where there's a culture of
[SPEAKER_09]: corruption is the wrong word, but
selfishness, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So how do you create, how do you get past
that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you have to talk to umpteen
different legislatures who are their own
[SPEAKER_09]: kings of their own little fiefdoms.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Tom Zuber said on a panel
yesterday, and I thought he was spot on,
[SPEAKER_10]: one of the things that we didn't get right
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: is we don't talk a lot in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: about the actual medical benefits of
cannabis, that it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's killing cancer.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's helping people with Parkinson's and
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we talk about tax dollars because
America only cares about money.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the reality is we can get people off
opiates.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that is something where when
you start talking about medical benefits,
[SPEAKER_10]: you get people really excited and it isn't
just a dollar conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a question up there?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Darren Hickman from Africa News
Global.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to springboard off something Bo
just mentioned talking about Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe Jessica, this might be for you
in your capacity as the head of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Council.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of their primary focuses is social
justice, social equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see international cannabis
strategy, business development strategies
[SPEAKER_01]: intermingled with the effort around social
justice and social equity?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, possibly bridging?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there are similar efforts in
Europe and Germany was mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: In South America, do you see possible
strategies to bridge these initiatives to
[SPEAKER_01]: leverage the international opportunities?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I certainly hope so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure that it's quite as
sophisticated as your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really appreciate that push to think
about things more globally and more
[SPEAKER_02]: holistically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say one of the big initiatives,
as you know, for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Council is social equity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that we have largely not
gotten right to date in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think it starts with
acknowledging, hey, we really haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten this right yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what can we do about it now?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we try to resolve that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really appreciate the push to say,
hey, is there a bridge to resolve it
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not only domestically within your
country, but there's some bridges to
[SPEAKER_02]: resolve it by reaching across the lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had the great pleasure to speak at
Parliament in the U.K.
[SPEAKER_02]: a few weeks ago as chair of USCC and was
able to really highlight this major topic
[SPEAKER_02]: that, hey, as you're thinking about your
country, your new legislation,
[SPEAKER_02]: learn from the fact that this is something
we really didn't get right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can we start to think about
getting that right moving forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just going to maybe circle back to
one point I made earlier, too,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is it doesn't have to be wholly
owned licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be really important partnerships
that couple people that bring different
[SPEAKER_02]: strengths to the table as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody should be in prison for this plan.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got to get these people out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank all
[SPEAKER_10]: of you for being involved and we'll see
you later.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
