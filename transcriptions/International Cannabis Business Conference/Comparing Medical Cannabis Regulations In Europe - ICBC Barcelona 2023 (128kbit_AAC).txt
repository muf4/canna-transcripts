[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back, did you enjoy your lunch?
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, did you enjoy your lunch?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, I know some of you didn't eat,
you just sat down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give it up for our emcee, Ungayo Bielam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Keeping it funky and fresh all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's so funky fresh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, we love you, Ungayo, look at
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're like a supermodel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue steel.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Alex Rogers, by the way,
he put this whole thing together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for Alex, let's hear it for
the whole team at the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, we're international, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: We thank you all for coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We really appreciate all of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one will be in English.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need a translating device,
we have them over there by the coat check.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget the party tonight,
nine o'clock at the Ritz-Harts Hotel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, discount tickets for Berliner Hotel.
[SPEAKER_07]: And please, please, I'm begging you,
please, please, pretty please,
[SPEAKER_07]: go upstairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And check out some of the exhibitors up
there as well, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: They get lonely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's, you know, there's more food
up there than there is downstairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, just trying to give you an incentive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, we're gonna discuss comparing
medical cannabis regulations in Europe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here to lead that discussion,
the co-founder of SAEFA Abogados.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for Guillermo Fernandez
Navarro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, good morning to everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a pleasure to be here one year more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk and enjoy talking about medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanna learn about how is the situation
in different countries, like Canadian,
[SPEAKER_08]: Portugal, Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_08]: And United States.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's gonna be very, very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, let's start.
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I'm gonna let my colleagues
to introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can start, I think, from Alex,
please.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you everyone for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in the medical cannabis space
since 2013, working with many different
[SPEAKER_03]: companies over there over my time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm a partner in an edibles
manufacturer called Lushman.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're sitting right over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Hybrid Farm, we're one of the first
pharmacies in North America to have
[SPEAKER_03]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hot off the presses, we just launched
a new trade association called the Global
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Trade Association in Canada,
helping facilitate international business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, very excited about that and excited to
be here with you all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much, Alex.
[SPEAKER_05]: Carlos, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the opportunity to be here with
you all.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Carlos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from Bangladesh Solutions.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the first consultancy company in
the medical cannabis in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we are helping the investors and the
growers to build their project in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: developing all the technical part and also
following all the guidelines to get
[SPEAKER_05]: certification, also the license process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are doing this from since 2018.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Daniel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a lawyer in Switzerland in life
sciences as well as in corporate law,
[SPEAKER_02]: specialized in cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the co-founder of the International
Cannabis Bar Association Europe section
[SPEAKER_02]: together with Kyle sitting back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And father of three.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also important, small hobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And apart from that, very active with
various companies in Switzerland in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Santiago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hello everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pleasure to be here again.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Santiago Ongay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came to the cannabis industry in 2008 as
a hobbyist, cultivator and distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I then entered the software
traceability space once regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: started to be released and the need for
traceability was apparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I've been working there for the past
eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as of recently, I co-founded a
mycology company in the psychedelic
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here to talk about mainly the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis industry and the
traceability within that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, Antin.
[SPEAKER_08]: And about myself, co-founder of El Serio
de Abogados.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been working in the cannabis
industry for almost 15 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: We work in all the sectors from criminal
law to licensing, going through to
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, anything we can help, here we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's start.
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, I think we're going to start
from Alex.
[SPEAKER_08]: Briefly, please, how's the medical
cannabis market going in Canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll try to do it as briefly as
possible and say pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've come a long way, but since the
regulations kind of came out, we've kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of worked within them and slowly stretched
them out to a decent regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the sort of answer I would
describe it as, we're probably better than
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty much everywhere else, but still
have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Carlos, how's everything going in
Portugal?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, we have the new regulations
we're listing in 2018.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's illegal to grow medical
cannabis since 1993, but with the big
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, in fact, from the international
companies, especially from Canada,
[SPEAKER_05]: they would like to come to Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our authorities started looking for how
they can help those companies to build and
[SPEAKER_05]: license their activities there in
Portugal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the new regulation was released in
2018, which helps a lot in terms of how we
[SPEAKER_05]: can do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was more clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know exactly what is the path that we
can take.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I believe that in terms of getting the
license or build your own project,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's more solid at the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is not too clear for us in Portugal
is the products that we have available on
[SPEAKER_05]: the farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that that is one of the main
issues that we have at the moment in
[SPEAKER_05]: Portugal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will talk about products after.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Daniel, framework opened up in Switzerland
last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: How is everything going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also going to try to be brief,
but essentially, the framework before it
[SPEAKER_02]: opened up last year was that you needed a
special permit from the Federal Office of
[SPEAKER_02]: Public Health to be able to procure and
get cannabis prescribed by a doctor in
[SPEAKER_02]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite complicated from an
administrative perspective process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this changed last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still complicated, but what changed
is that cannabis was reclassified from a
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibited narcotic to a controlled
substance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, every doctor in Switzerland can
freely prescribe medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was a huge step forward for the
medical market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is that doctors are faced with
a lot of challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the challenges, for example,
is that they don't...
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest challenge, they don't know
much about medical cannabis, don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: how to prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of administrative burdens
that they're faced with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's going well and there is an
interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there hasn't been mass adoption
by doctors yet, but there is full
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutic freedom for doctors to
prescribe for whatever ailment they wish.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a lot of education that needs
to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I would say we're a very big step
forward, but we're far away from where we
[SPEAKER_02]: want to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: You just start.
[SPEAKER_08]: At least you start in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can explain that we are still waiting
for a politician to take the first step.
[SPEAKER_05]: May I just ask you one thing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: The doctor can prescribe for the first
time and there isn't any kind of ranking
[SPEAKER_05]: in terms of medicine they can prescribe?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past, there was a ranking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically had to be half dead and try
everything else first before you got
[SPEAKER_02]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today, there's full therapeutic
freedom, which means it's in the
[SPEAKER_02]: assessment of the doctor himself or
herself to prescribe medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they're also confronted with
liability issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they still carry full liability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one of the reasons
they're actually very reluctant to
[SPEAKER_02]: prescribe cannabis and also, in
Switzerland, the market really is not
[SPEAKER_02]: on...
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already talking about the products,
but in Switzerland, there is no real
[SPEAKER_02]: market for cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, even thinking about flower and
smokeables, we're far away from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was telling that because in Portugal,
there are some products available,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's only possible to prescribe as a
last resort.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't make any sense, but it is what
it is at the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in terms of products, you have only
two available, which is nothing compared
[SPEAKER_05]: to what we can get in other markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, it's too short for the patients
that are looking for this kind of product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And another thing that you said,
and I completely agree with you,
[SPEAKER_05]: we need to have more studies or more
knowledge for the medical community,
[SPEAKER_05]: so they can be more confident in
prescribing these kind of products.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that all of us should
push a little bit more to be fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I add one more thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I think it's very important to
include associations.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, there's the Swiss Society of
Cannabis and Medicine in Switzerland that
[SPEAKER_02]: was mandated by the Federal Office of
Public... By the Health Ministry in
[SPEAKER_02]: Switzerland to basically put together
therapeutic guidance or guidelines that
[SPEAKER_02]: doctors can take and see for which
medication setup would make sense and
[SPEAKER_02]: which dosage and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's something that I would really
try to encourage in countries where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: only just starting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same as in Switzerland now, in its
infancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Santiago, can you tell us which
requirements patients need in the United
[SPEAKER_08]: States to become a patient?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in the US, we have more than 30 micro
industries, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not legal at the federal level yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It remains a schedule one substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, every state has its own regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical industry, I would use a
different term.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would use therapeutic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is very different from your
typical medical industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't go to the same doctor,
you don't go to the same pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the first thing that you need in order
to become a patient is to be under the
[SPEAKER_01]: correct ailment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, usually when a market opens up in the
United States, it'll be similar,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be half dead in order to get a
medical license.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, as soon as they become more
comfortable with the market, they add
[SPEAKER_01]: something like chronic pain to the list of
ailments, which significantly opens up
[SPEAKER_01]: this therapeutic market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost a way to test the recreational
market, still making people go to doctors,
[SPEAKER_01]: which the doctors prescribing are usually
doctors that were retired and come out of
[SPEAKER_01]: retirement in order to charge $100 per
prescription that they write.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's fairly easy to get a medical
license in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: The incentive to be a medical patient is
really just where there's no recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, when both industries are
available or alive, then really the only
[SPEAKER_01]: incentive to be a patient is to pay less
taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a little bit of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to know about Canala
because... Just real quick on Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to point out that when we
started, it was also a last case resort.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to show you've tried like
everything else, but we found the way
[SPEAKER_03]: around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing I always try and tell people
who are building international markets is
[SPEAKER_03]: work with the crappy rules you're given,
no matter how crappy they are,
[SPEAKER_03]: because we started really crappy and we've
kind of expanded it to now it can be a
[SPEAKER_03]: first line of treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And two things like pain, which is a
little more subjective rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: measured.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I would really implore people to kind
of work with it, even no matter how bad it
[SPEAKER_03]: is, because we've been there before.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let us know, Alex, also about which kind
of products patients can get in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like when it started, it was only
dry flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a close friend of mine whose
daughter has a rare form of epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he was converting his flour into oil,
and that was actually against the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he could have been going to jail and
had his kid taken away.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy to think about it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems like a lifetime ago,
but it was only flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we had oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we have edible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have all kinds of extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we have limitations on it,
which we can get into a little bit later
[SPEAKER_03]: when we talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have a lot of the products now and
it's come a long way, but there's still a
[SPEAKER_03]: long way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I'm interested to hear about the
kind of Portugal and Swiss.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Switzerland is really CBD,
only from what I'm hearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, every country kind of starts
very similar and then just explodes in
[SPEAKER_03]: their own way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I would love to hear some other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for now, for example, in Portugal,
we only have available set effects and the
[SPEAKER_05]: flowers from Tilbury, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know that there are a lot of
companies that are trying to license and
[SPEAKER_05]: get the special authorization for their
products, but that kind of process will
[SPEAKER_05]: take at least one, two years to get it
done, which is a lot of time for an
[SPEAKER_05]: investor to wait.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially because, I mean,
Portugal is a small country, so perhaps
[SPEAKER_05]: there is no kind of advantage of looking
for our market to license and take so much
[SPEAKER_05]: time to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, it could be
something that then you can expand for the
[SPEAKER_05]: rest of the European countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the advantage for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, you can start in Portugal
and then you can try to adapt the same
[SPEAKER_05]: authorization for the other countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, it will take you a lot of
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that that's why it is taking
so much to get new products in our market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so Switzerland is not just a CBD
market, but it's really well known for
[SPEAKER_02]: being, you know, for the consumer markets,
a big CBD hub, CBD producer of oils and so
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, on the medical sphere,
there is also CBD that is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: prescribed by form of magisterial
preparation in certain, there's not many
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacies that do it, but a few,
CBD, and obviously THC now as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking mostly full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Switzerland, there's only two fully
licensed drugs, which is Epidiolex and
[SPEAKER_02]: Sativex.
[SPEAKER_02]: In most cases, they're used off label.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, these, and also not necessarily
and always reimbursed by the health
[SPEAKER_02]: insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another subject that we can touch
upon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, most cannabis in
Switzerland is prescribed now with THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, and by way of magisterial
preparation, which the pharmacies have to
[SPEAKER_02]: be involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same as Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is great, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we're talking medical products
that have gone through clinical trials and
[SPEAKER_01]: have FDA approved, then we're talking that
Sativex and Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally have never seen those
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I never see them in my life,
I would be totally fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical industry, which again,
I would name therapeutic, has any type of
[SPEAKER_01]: product under the sun, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the innovation comes from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have, also being micro industries,
you have states that allow everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have other states that because of
the medical argument, they wouldn't allow
[SPEAKER_01]: flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next step is to allow flour,
but not smokable, only vaporized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those states might not allow pre-roll
sales, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will sell you flour, but technically
you cannot roll it and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to vaporize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just curious, because you said before
that cannabis doctors basically are
[SPEAKER_02]: specialized doctors in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would they also prescribe other
medication?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have, you know, I'm just thinking
about a neuropathic pain patient,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, that has a mix of maybe
three, four various medications that the
[SPEAKER_02]: person needs to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say specialized is a loose term.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just doctors that are coming out
of retirement so that they can make a few
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred dollars a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're as specialized as they need to
be in order.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will only prescribe cannabis
then?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't prescribe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They allow you to get a license that
allows you to enter a medical... Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: we say they authorize the use of cannabis,
because cannabis doesn't have a drug
[SPEAKER_03]: identification number, so it can't be
prescribed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we say they authorize the use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And quickly, just to point out,
why are all the retired doctors doing it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was also wondering, why are all
these old doctors doing it?
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason is they're not scared of losing
their license.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's these young guys who are like,
oh, I don't want the stigma and I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want people to know me as a cannabis
doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: These old guys are like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just cover my beers at the golf
course, and they just go and do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, that's how the industry started.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point, Alex.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's crazy to think that a doctor can
lose the license in a regular market.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the US, it's still a scheduled one
substance, so it's still federally legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to point out, we had a lot of threats
of doctors losing their license.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can tell you, in Canada,
no one ended up losing their license.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter how much investigations and
everything, everyone was so scared,
[SPEAKER_03]: it never happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's more just threats.
[SPEAKER_08]: And another important issue, guys,
what about insurance or social security?
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the insurance cover the medical
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start, because I kind of made a
career out of this insurance thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I helped a lot of military veterans help
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm very proud of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it helped with a lot of conditions of
PTSD and removed a lot of their other
[SPEAKER_03]: medications.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's a whole long story.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it made a lot of money for the company
I was a part of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people right away were like,
oh, you're just doing it for the money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of us were only doing it for the
money, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I actually always really cared about
the veterans.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew them all by name.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know how much it helped them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it changed their lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: So military veterans were getting
coverage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're starting to see some police
people get coverage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Private insurance is covering up to $2,000
with health care spending accounts,
[SPEAKER_03]: which you can use for massages and other
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're starting to see a big move in
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to be a big game changer.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk about medical versus rec a
little later, I'll kind of explain a
[SPEAKER_03]: little more.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, we're all waiting for the
insurance train to come along.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost arrived.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's going to come, like for example,
Germany has pharmacare already.
[SPEAKER_03]: So insurance is going to be a real big
push of the medical cannabis market
[SPEAKER_03]: internationally, eventually, with more
research, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about Portugal, Carlos?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, as a matter of fact, we don't have
any or too much experience with the
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think we have the basic knowledge of
the product itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know any kind of insurance
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, a private insuring company
that can help the patients in this matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that our health authority can call
for this kind of products.
[SPEAKER_05]: But until now, there is no support in this
kind of products, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just before I come to Switzerland,
I have a question for you, Alex,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you mentioned it depends what kind
of basically patient population you come
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it more the patient population that
matters, whether you're in the police
[SPEAKER_02]: force or whether you're a veteran,
rather than your personal... So what
[SPEAKER_03]: happened, good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all started with post-traumatic stress
disorder, the veterans, it showed how much
[SPEAKER_03]: it helped, and now others are like,
wait a minute, we have PTSD, so RCMP,
[SPEAKER_03]: Royal Canadian Mountain Police,
there are a certain type of police,
[SPEAKER_03]: so they're now trying it, and again,
the results are so amazing, there's
[SPEAKER_03]: something called polypharma, where you
take 12 medications to help with two
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions, cannabis replaces that,
and we watched that happen, so I think
[SPEAKER_03]: what's happening is once people are seeing
it, we're starting to see more insurance
[SPEAKER_03]: coverage, and that's the importance of
research and education, because once
[SPEAKER_03]: people see it, they see actually it could
be very beneficial, and save the money,
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're all about making money,
insurance companies, and that's okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have to show them that cannabis can
actually be cost-effective for them,
[SPEAKER_03]: and get people back to work faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's similar in Switzerland, where we see
that medical cannabis can replace one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the pitches basically of the industry,
to say there's a possibility with medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to replace other medication in a
multi-medication setup, and that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: economic background that needs to be shown
and evidenced, but in terms of health
[SPEAKER_02]: insurance, it's very important also to
show the individual patient journey,
[SPEAKER_02]: and to document that journey with strong
data, and the better you can underwrite
[SPEAKER_02]: that data, and send your special,
because the basis is it's not reimbursed,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where it starts, so you need to
convince your health insurance on an
[SPEAKER_02]: individual basis, that it is actually
helping the patient with health,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that it's also economical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do collect the data, that's so
important, we weren't really doing that
[SPEAKER_03]: that much, I think that could be a really
good start, because the data speaks for
[SPEAKER_02]: itself, you can't argue with the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, and we've been doing that with a
client of mine in one specific case,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's been working really well,
and we wrote down all the data and so on,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the patient got reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a patient's association that
helps with the processes, which is very
[SPEAKER_02]: important as well, but we're getting
there, and the insurances are opening up,
[SPEAKER_02]: they realize that this could have economic
value for them as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Daniel, what about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the US, the quick answer is no,
they don't cover it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew that, I knew that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you, and Alex, I would like to
ask you, how do the recreational and
[SPEAKER_08]: medical markets coexist, and how was the
transaction?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so this is a question I get asked a
lot, you know, when I'm in Germany,
[SPEAKER_03]: and even here, people are saying like,
what happens when you go from medical to
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational, and I'll try to kind of give
you a very brief answer to this,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that it was very tricky, a lot of
people who were pretending they were
[SPEAKER_03]: medical, quickly took off their medical
hat, burned it, and just put on the rec
[SPEAKER_03]: hat, and it was like, yippee, let's go
make millions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't work out that way, but you
realize what people's kind of intentions
[SPEAKER_03]: are very quickly, and like there's a few
kind of examples, like for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: like milligrams of THC for medical,
is the same as with recreational,
[SPEAKER_03]: like it's still the same 10 milligrams for
edibles as an example, and the way things
[SPEAKER_03]: are sold, that's another big difference,
like with medical, we were selling it
[SPEAKER_03]: directly to patients from licensed
producers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now with recreational, we sell it directly
to the government, so for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: with my edibles company, Loosh,
what we do is we sell it to the
[SPEAKER_03]: government, and then the government sells
it to the recreational stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the medical side, we can sell directly,
like for example, with my pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hybrid Farm, we sell directly to Hybrid
Farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So medical does have a lot of advantages,
but we need to educate people on it,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you can get reimbursed on your taxes,
by doing medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a few things like that,
but we believe with insurance coverage,
[SPEAKER_03]: with increase of milligrams of THC for
edibles as an example, there's just a few
[SPEAKER_03]: things that we're waiting for,
like taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're taxed equally for medical and
recreational, but if something is a
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine in Canada, there are no taxes on
medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it feels very weird to say all medical
is not taxed, all medicine is not taxed
[SPEAKER_03]: except cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are some of the kind of growing
pains that we're going through from that
[SPEAKER_03]: transition, but it's still great,
and really like Germany and all these
[SPEAKER_03]: other countries that are doing this
transition, I think can learn from it,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's very exciting to kind of see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now medical is going to slowly pick up
again, and REC is going to plateau off,
[SPEAKER_03]: and hopefully we'll have a good market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about the United States?
[SPEAKER_08]: Santiago?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the US, I think it's very similar to
Canada, since again, it's not a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: market, so you don't have to take any
products through clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: The standard of quality for REC and med is
very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk about Colorado as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some states that like it's hard
to understand the difference, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No difference in milligram percentage,
no difference in traceability.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, they decided to separate
medical and recreational at the seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: which makes business logistics a little
complex, but you have to decide when you
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that seed or take the clone,
if it's going to be medical throughout its
[SPEAKER_01]: whole journey and only be sold in a
medical dispensary or if it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational, even though the product
could be exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, there is a difference between
milligram.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, an edible on the medical side
can be up to 500 milligrams, whereas on
[SPEAKER_01]: the recreational side, it could only be up
to 100, and taxes are different as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical does get taxed, but it's a little
lower than the recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that was driving us crazy is
that you can buy a bottle of oil that has
[SPEAKER_03]: a thousand milligrams, and just chug it
down, but we make a lozenge that has 10
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams, and the government's really
scared about how many pieces, but I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: wait a minute, you have a thousand
milligram oil you can chug.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to eat a hundred of these
lozenges to have the same amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about how much work that is,
and you're worried about protecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think one thing that's if you've been
here all day, you've heard about Spain and
[SPEAKER_03]: all the different countries, the
government, they make rules that don't
[SPEAKER_03]: make sense, and that's normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to get away from it,
but we almost have to work with their
[SPEAKER_03]: stupid rules, and slowly let them figure
it out themselves what the right answer
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Banging your head against the wall and
spending money on lobbying could be
[SPEAKER_03]: helpful, but ultimately, the only way
they're going to change is by seeing that
[SPEAKER_03]: the sky is not falling.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: When rec happened, people are like,
oh, now everyone's going to get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: When medical happened, oh, now everyone's
going to get high, and they realized the
[SPEAKER_03]: same people who were getting high before
are still getting high, and the people
[SPEAKER_03]: that weren't before are still not that
interested.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of what happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Carlos and Daniel, can you tell us
requirements to get a medical license?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, our regulations are really solid.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know exactly what we can do in order to
achieve the license.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to comply with the GACP or the
GMP, depending on what you want to grow or
[SPEAKER_05]: manufacturer.
We don't know how many people work in the
same industry, so we need to be very
[SPEAKER_05]: clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting the security done, traceability is
really important, our health authority is
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for traceability, quality of the
product, and making sure that you are not
[SPEAKER_05]: doing it for the black market,
for example.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say that the security,
the quality, and traceability are the key
[SPEAKER_05]: factors to get the license.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's important to have a strong
team.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to have a really strong team,
the knowledge of what you are doing next,
[SPEAKER_05]: because otherwise you will just be there
and your product will be on hold for
[SPEAKER_05]: eternity, for example.
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is happening actually at the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some companies are trying to figure out
how they will move forward with the
[SPEAKER_05]: project.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, in terms of requirements,
it's quite simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, anyway, it takes a lot of time,
again, to do everything, because even if
[SPEAKER_05]: you have a project and a business plan and
you know exactly what you are doing,
[SPEAKER_05]: you need to build all the project,
all the facilities, getting the people
[SPEAKER_05]: there, working really hard on the SOPs to
comply with the GSEP or the GMP,
[SPEAKER_05]: and only after that you get the license
and you can start growing and you can
[SPEAKER_05]: start selling.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I would say that the business plan is
really important, because you will spend a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of money in the meantime and you don't
have any kind of revenue.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, in terms of the requirements itself,
it's quite understandable and achievable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like in Spain, you need to have the
product sold already.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you need to have someone from the
medical market.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they need to be already licensed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to have someone that intends to
buy your product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not a binding contract,
but, again, you need to have someone that
[SPEAKER_05]: is interested in buying your product as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, the same is in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombia also made a similar rule,
which we won't get into here, but it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: People can't buy a product eight months in
advance when they need to buy it today.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know what the price is going to
be in eight months.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, unfortunately, sometimes people make
rules that they don't actually intend on
[SPEAKER_03]: working, and we have to always be very
careful of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, at least in Portugal,
a pharmaceutical market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what we try to tell is they want
papers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want the SOPs, all the non-binding
contracts, all the contracts with a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: the people that are working on their
facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, they like papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just roadblocks, and not to get all
conspiracy theory here, but, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, in Germany, the
pharmaceutical industry has a seat at the
[SPEAKER_03]: table in cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, when you put someone at the table that
has a vested interest in your lack of
[SPEAKER_03]: success, it creates a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, whenever people wonder, like,
wait, why are they making these rules?
[SPEAKER_03]: These are stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because usually they're made by
people that don't want them to work,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we have to understand it and work with
it, not just say, ah, sue and get pissed
[SPEAKER_03]: off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just say, okay, we're going to make it
work, and slowly change it the other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they introduced a new system,
which is, like, two-tiered, so you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: get the general license to be able to
produce and cultivate cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then a single cultivation license on
top of that for each grow, which makes it
[SPEAKER_02]: a bit more complicated, but it's actually
a good system, and then you can transfer
[SPEAKER_02]: it and sell that to another company that
also has a license to handle narcotic
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, you can actually start to
do distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need an extra license to export.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is maybe where an interesting
thing happens, is where the various terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of what medical cannabis means in
Switzerland and in nearby countries
[SPEAKER_02]: diverge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in Switzerland, the production of
medical cannabis has to be under GACP
[SPEAKER_02]: rules, at least the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the interesting part is that the
drying then, and the drying part is
[SPEAKER_02]: considered a GMP step, and in some other
countries, the drying process is not
[SPEAKER_02]: considered GMP.
[SPEAKER_02]: But essentially, I would say, if you want
to be a serious player in this market,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to have a GMP set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to be able to dry your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can outsource that step, and then from
there on, you can go into distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the things, by the way,
that changed in this legislation last
[SPEAKER_02]: year, is that Switzerland now,
or Swiss producers, can now export medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to know... Just one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Portugal, for example, you can be GACP
certified, and you can do all the process
[SPEAKER_05]: from seed to sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we don't need to be GMP certified to
try the flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: But obviously, if you want to,
you can do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it will take you an extra time,
an extra license.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, normally, companies will start with
the GACP, and in one or two years,
[SPEAKER_05]: they move forward with the GMP.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's hard to get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what about the final products you can
produce in Portugal?
[SPEAKER_08]: Flowers, tractions?
[SPEAKER_05]: In Portugal, you can do, I would say,
whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Depending on the level of THC,
or even CBD, it's a matter of telling the
[SPEAKER_05]: authorities what you are growing or
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And after that, they will grant you the
license.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alex and Santiago, because the revolutions
in Canada and the US have been going on
[SPEAKER_08]: for a long time, what would you change in
the law?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is something you would... I'm going
to go before Alex, because I think he'll
[SPEAKER_01]: speak longer than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the US, I think the majority of
people didn't know what GACP or GMP meant,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they didn't need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different across states.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Florida, they gave out seven licenses
to begin, so you needed 30 years of
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural land, 50 million escrow in
the bank in order to get a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, only a few people can play in a
state like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Oklahoma, you needed $2,000 and a
dream, and anybody could get a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the products you can produce are
pretty much any products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in the US, it's definitely an
interesting mix of dynamics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I would change, to your point,
is probably raise the level of
[SPEAKER_01]: professionalism in the medical industry
without completely killing it the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: other countries are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we definitely need to at least be
under GACP and GMP standards if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to call the industry a medical
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I would at least want a little more
differentiation between recreational and
[SPEAKER_01]: medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm grateful for the way things
happened, because it opened up the market
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: For good and bad, mostly good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I jump in here as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in Switzerland, also, there's
going to be some differentiation in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of products, because you've been asking
before about the legalized market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, we're also doing that in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a process of legalizing
non-medical adult use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think one of the differentiators
will probably be that cannabis flower for
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking and also for vaporization will
probably be more prevalent in the
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational non-medical markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other products like oils, tinctures,
capsules, and all other forms,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe even edibles at some stage,
they will be reserved for the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, as it should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just quickly on that, 85% of all our
products at the pharmacy are sold are not
[SPEAKER_03]: flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm so happy to hear that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, super fast, rapid fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to make a quick note on it,
because honestly, I can think of a
[SPEAKER_03]: thousand things that I would change,
but just super quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dangers of the wrong investor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You talk about how expensive this is.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you find the wrong investor,
you're screwed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You find an investor who wants their money
ASAP or pretends they, oh, we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: give you time, but then as soon as they
invest, they start whipping you,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, one thing I would change is maybe
better access to the funding for this,
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're finding ways to make it less
expensive to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the challenge is the illicit market
and the government.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of times people are looking
at competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're building a market,
you need to actually be friends with the
[SPEAKER_03]: competitors and build this together,
because your competitors are really the
[SPEAKER_03]: old way of doing things and also the
government.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, working together and making the pie
and then cutting it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I know we don't have too much more
time, but changing of perception is really
[SPEAKER_03]: important.
[SPEAKER_03]: 75% of people are buying legal cannabis
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be 35% in 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we've come a long way, and that's also
going to help change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hopefully we left some time for
questions from the audience.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some time for questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's somebody in the back.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's got her hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: She's been waving her hand for like five
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You always got to leave time for questions
for these fine people to see what we can
[SPEAKER_03]: tell them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're available after also and at the
after party, but probably talk to us early
[SPEAKER_03]: at the after party.
[SPEAKER_03]: For best answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have any questions, go to Alex.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm around as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Laura.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just moved to Spain this past September.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was an acupuncturist, and I work with
people with cancer for the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my people did the RSO protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decided not to do the chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these people are still well
and alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I can't wait until there is enough
research to realize that we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine to stop cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, where are you guys with the data,
the people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has this been talked about with the
chemotherapy companies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we with all of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start with a real quick answer on
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, I never talk about curing
cancer with cannabis because obviously
[SPEAKER_03]: there's not enough research.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we help a lot of side effects of
treatment and symptom management and like
[SPEAKER_03]: dealing with like sleep, pain,
things of the treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a Dr. Sanchez out of Madrid that
has done some unbelievable research about
[SPEAKER_03]: cancer cells committing suicide with
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, super preliminary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem is we can't build a
business or an industry of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I never talked about curing anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got us to this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super excited to hope that this is
going to be something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be very useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And RSO, shout out to Rick Simpson,
Canadian, that's named after him,
[SPEAKER_03]: who still survived.
[SPEAKER_03]: He told them he only had a few months left
to live, and he's still alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they named an oil after him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there's obviously something very
special there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to talk about it, but we don't
lead with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we lead with it, right away people are
like, ah, yeah, this is all snake oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if snake oil means anything
to anyone here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a European thing too, or no?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that just us?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just people think it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would comment real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, unfortunately, the United States
is not the right industry to collect that
[SPEAKER_01]: type of data because they're too far gone
in their therapeutic quasi-recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: medical industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they don't have the incentives really
to need to collect this data and do these
[SPEAKER_01]: studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do have enough people consuming
and enough similar stories like this,
[SPEAKER_01]: where if the data were to be collected,
it could be completely world changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hope that other countries that are
still trying to push these regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: forward do put these studies and this data
first in order to change that stigma
[SPEAKER_01]: quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm half Israeli, so I'm a bit biased
here, but I would also recommend to check
[SPEAKER_02]: out some of the research of Dedi Meiri,
Professor Dedi Meiri at University of
[SPEAKER_02]: Haifa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there's a few others as well,
but I know there's been, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's been talking about a study that he
made for colon cancer and where the use of
[SPEAKER_02]: certain strains led to a retraction of
metastasis in the body and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've heard a lot of stories,
but obviously, and I agree fully with what
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex said, that that's not how the
industry should position itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there's so much research that needs
to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lower hanging fruit with things we
know for sure like chronic pain,
[SPEAKER_03]: like sleep, like nausea, like an increase
of appetite.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are like for sure easy ones and the
doctors are behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's why.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Laura, I'm happy to talk to you after
I have some more thoughts on it and come
[SPEAKER_03]: find me for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also from personal experience with friends
of mine who have been through chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_02]: and have used cannabis extensively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really helped them during that
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another one over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question for Daniel, but also for
all the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to know specifically for
Switzerland, but I can see that Germany
[SPEAKER_04]: also is taking the same direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why for the medical market, the government
allows importation of products from
[SPEAKER_04]: outside, from cannabis, but for the
recreational not?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the testing that is done in the
recreational is only local production.
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany, when they draw the first proposal
of the law, it seems to go in that
[SPEAKER_04]: direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because it should be the opposite
because the recreational consumers would
[SPEAKER_04]: like to have some variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can answer that pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Switzerland, recreational cannabis or I
would say non-medical adult use cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: as I've been taught, is not legal yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, in the context of scientific studies,
there are now pilot studies that were
[SPEAKER_02]: opened up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the first trials in Basel where
cannabis, red cannabis is being dispensed
[SPEAKER_02]: in pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, there's a clause in that
ordinance that says if not enough
[SPEAKER_02]: production can be procured locally to
satisfy those trials in the context of a
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific study, then it can resort to
importation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not there yet because
Switzerland obviously is in a position and
[SPEAKER_02]: has enough companies that can procure
relatively low levels and low amounts of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the medical space, obviously,
it's an open market because it's medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also have the international legal
frameworks to facilitate these
[SPEAKER_02]: cross-border movements of medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, just really quick, the answer is
very simple for you and we can talk after
[SPEAKER_03]: a longer version, but the answer is
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're protecting their business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I come from a country where we're
protecting our business right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't allow for importation of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people are pretty upset that
Canada's exporting, but we're not allowing
[SPEAKER_03]: for import.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're protecting our industries,
which people have spent hundreds of
[SPEAKER_03]: millions of dollars on and many investors
have already lost so much money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's a way of protecting the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the German tender hasn't even come out
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's rumors of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever they do, we'll start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany's capable of producing all the
varieties you've ever dreamed of at the
[SPEAKER_03]: best qualities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little more expensive because they
have a higher cost there, but everything
[SPEAKER_03]: is possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just chip in one more thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a previous commodities trader,
I'm actually very much a proponent of
[SPEAKER_02]: cross-border trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a big fan of protectionism.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's something that will
last for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in these industries, I really think
that you have to brace yourself for a
[SPEAKER_02]: period, at least a period, of some form,
mixed or full protectionism when the
[SPEAKER_02]: markets open up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Germany, it seems to go in the same
direction.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to say, as an enjoyer of
morality, Moroccan hash and Spanish wine,
[SPEAKER_07]: I would also like to see global.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like African sativas.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like California weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You understand what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to go to the store in
California and buy a Tempranillo and some
[SPEAKER_07]: Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be great.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're out of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it again for our panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guillermo, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure if you have more questions,
you can talk to them outside the hall.
