[SPEAKER_06]: All right, to lead the next panel on
policy reform and the industry,
[SPEAKER_06]: he's the founder of the International
Cannabis Business Conference Series.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been an activist and a mover and a
shaker in the cannabis industry for 30
[SPEAKER_06]: years, at least, and he's here for us now,
and he lives in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it for Alex Rogers!
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, and let's give a big round of
applause for Umgai Obelam, the wonderful
[SPEAKER_08]: MC, ICBC.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it can't be a totally boring
conference when Umgai is the MC,
[SPEAKER_08]: so, and thank you again, Peter,
really appreciate you, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we're gonna talk about policy reform
and industry, and I have some very
[SPEAKER_08]: esteemed guests with me here.
[SPEAKER_08]: To my right is Gaspar Friskovich.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the chief compliance officer for the
Tallman Group, and we have the deputy
[SPEAKER_08]: mayor of Ljubljana in the house,
Bostjan Kortenik.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bostjan, very nice to have you here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have Bo탑idar Radicic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Bo탑idar is one of the longtime
activists in Slovenia, and to tell you the
[SPEAKER_08]: truth, we wouldn't even be here at this
gathering right now if it wasn't for
[SPEAKER_08]: Bo탑idar.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, let's give our esteemed panel members
a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, there's a few different aspects of
policy reform and industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Industry, when it comes to Slovenia,
this is a very hot topic right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's obviously why we're here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're fortunate enough to have analogous
models to look to, like Germany,
[SPEAKER_08]: like Switzerland, like certain other
countries in Europe right now that are
[SPEAKER_08]: moving forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, Germany's the big one.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, Bo탑idar, I wanna start with you,
and just what's your take right now on
[SPEAKER_08]: what's going on in Slovenia, and how do
you think we're, what's the most important
[SPEAKER_08]: things that you think we need to do to
move forward as one of the, if not the
[SPEAKER_08]: original granddaddy of activists,
streets activists?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a Slovenian double entendre,
but what's your opinion on the matter
[SPEAKER_08]: right now in Slovenia?
[SPEAKER_00]: As most of the world or Europe,
we still have very confused and very old
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation about everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's hard to do any research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 2000, we accepted the law about
decriminalization of use of any drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: including cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, after this actually got worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we are now try to, because before the
2000, it wasn't really a criminal offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just non-accepted by the society.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, when we implemented that law,
then actually it started the
[SPEAKER_00]: criminalization of users.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's the same like in the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until then, it was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, unfortunately, this criminalization
or this stigmatization of cannabis went
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way to research, and the research
was never prohibited until the single
[SPEAKER_00]: convention, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, for research, you need certain
documentation from ministries and
[SPEAKER_00]: bureaucrats and so on, and you could not
come through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard the story of Professor Neubauer
about the clinical study where he cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: move forward for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, I really think it's not okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think that we should change the
whole legislation on the field of drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just cannabis, because we do much more
harm to people than they have benefit to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Prohibition being a failed policy in
general.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, Goshbert, can you tell us what are
some of the statutory hurdles,
[SPEAKER_08]: one might say, in terms of the UN and the
EU's perspective on this?
[SPEAKER_08]: And, what are some hurdles that we and
other countries might be facing right now
[SPEAKER_08]: in Europe when it comes to modernizing
cannabis policy?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as already my colleague explained,
it's really hard to we generally speak
[SPEAKER_02]: about legalization, but it's something
that's really hard to achieve,
[SPEAKER_02]: because on the UN level, we have the 61
and 71 and 88 convention, which all
[SPEAKER_02]: basically prohibits cannabis for all use
except for medical and research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, we have the EU legislation
with the Schengen agreement being the
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest one, which also prohibits and
recalls to the UN conventions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, of course, every member state also
has its own legislation, which is a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there is no one cannabis legislation
in Europe or in the member states,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though we have two, let's say,
legislative steps above it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The UN and the European legislation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's a bit confusing also for the
researchers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, for the consumers, and I think it's
not okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what's this idea?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what is okay, as far as I understand,
is doing for research and medical
[SPEAKER_08]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bozo, could you explain a little bit what
that entails, what that means?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Slovenia already adopted
cannabis into drugs, which are accessible
[SPEAKER_00]: through the medical system back in 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, except Professor Neubauer and maybe
one of two of his colleagues, you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: find a doctor who will prescribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and nowadays, I think because of this
situation, the patients are even in worse
[SPEAKER_00]: situation than it was 10 years ago,
and in worse that it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with this situation, this
stigmatization of cannabis and with the
[SPEAKER_00]: attitude of Ministry of Health,
or better to say, bureaucrats on Ministry
[SPEAKER_00]: of Health, doctors do not dare to
prescribe cannabis because they can have
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is a big mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hope that Slovenia, as many other
countries, will follow German model,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, I think, for the time being,
best what we can achieve inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: European Union, and I think follow as
usual.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd actually like to talk about that in a
little bit, because what are we going to
[SPEAKER_08]: do?
[SPEAKER_08]: What policy will we abide by?
[SPEAKER_08]: Will we get behind to push in Slovenia to
modernize its cannabis policy?
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's also the big question of how
that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Boscan, you know, politics as well as
anybody, I reckon, in this country,
[SPEAKER_08]: for better or for worse.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, like, how do we do it?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a lot of, you know,
up to this point, we're hitting certain
[SPEAKER_08]: walls and certain things.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, what are some of your
suggestions of how dynamic we can be in
[SPEAKER_08]: terms of getting this achieved,
without knowing exactly what we want to
[SPEAKER_08]: achieve?
[SPEAKER_08]: But what's that process kind of look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I know politics as good as
anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in politics for four years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Too much, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: But law is always resembled of interests.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it always depends what the interests of
the population are and what the interest
[SPEAKER_04]: of the governing party or the government
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And usually you have some real events that
resemble in legislation, or you have
[SPEAKER_04]: legislation that imposes action to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I've heard now, we have people to use
marijuana or cannabis, and we have doctors
[SPEAKER_04]: that could, but they don't prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have this double problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you get knowledge out that it can
be useful, we should use it or can help in
[SPEAKER_04]: many aspects.
[SPEAKER_04]: You always have bureaucrats, and
bureaucrats are made, and that's something
[SPEAKER_04]: that's not only known for Slovenia,
a status quo.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't change anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't take responsibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't be hurt or punished or
sanctioned.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is almost a cultural thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not only in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a general problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we have to do is we have to get
knowledge out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Conference like this is a great
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, following other people's
examples, if Germany could do it,
[SPEAKER_04]: can do it, we can too, because we're in
the same union.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's the best approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: If my personal opinion, and I'm not here
as deputy mayor, to be frank, I was warned
[SPEAKER_04]: to emphasize that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I can't even inhale,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I think the good approach would
be, in my honest opinion, if a political
[SPEAKER_04]: party would say, we will decriminalize
that, or we will make it really liberal,
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be a political suicide.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what has to be done in the backstage,
they should agree on the positive effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: They should, let's say, stimulate
conferences like this, and afterwards come
[SPEAKER_04]: with a political, legal solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be my advice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the past, in Slovenia, it hasn't
been that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the propositions coming from the
activist community have not necessarily
[SPEAKER_08]: coalesced well with the political aspect
of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you say that's true?
[SPEAKER_04]: By all means, and not only in this area,
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't get real pressure from the
people, from the voters, then you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: have some other incentive for the
political parties to get into the boat.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what do you think that a consensus
would look like?
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the incentive for people to change
this ever so coveted status quo?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, again, honest money, always money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I was in the right wing
government, even though I'm not a right
[SPEAKER_04]: political, I'd say, lover.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I always said we had this COVID
applications, and my statement was,
[SPEAKER_04]: we give 10 euros to everyone, they would
give all personal data for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for free, for 10 euros.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we always do in the stores,
we gather points, you know, loyalty
[SPEAKER_04]: points, we give out our personal data as
if it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if a government imposes that,
that's a negative thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we give money to the people,
we get direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same is here.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you give money to the people,
and people are also in the government,
[SPEAKER_04]: we get action.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really appreciate your candor,
Mr. David May.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's give it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: We like to hear that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I wasn't gonna say my question
was rhetorical, but it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now let's talk about a little bit,
maybe what's can Slovenia do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bozo, you're talking about following the
German model.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gasper, what would you say that is,
what do you think some of the best aspects
[SPEAKER_08]: of the German model are?
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is quite a, a poignant question,
especially after Mr. Holmberg just spoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so regarding the German model,
in my honest opinion, their first pillar
[SPEAKER_02]: model is the wrong approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So their second pillar, which would be the
pilot project, that is, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: the better option.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's credentially the same approach
that Switzerland is taking, and it's in
[SPEAKER_02]: accordance with the EU regulations and the
European regulations because it falls
[SPEAKER_02]: under research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that would be the best
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can, we could then research,
because nowadays the question even still
[SPEAKER_02]: is, is cannabis a bad drug?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it bad?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it affect people?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it affect absenteeism,
traffic safety, and so on and so on?
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the things that really could
be tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even to get some of the, I'm gonna say
false information out of the way,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's a lot of it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, I just heard one a couple of
days ago, I was reading a report for 2022,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it said that the road traffic safety
really decreased when a country adopted
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, well, where can we check that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, okay, so Netherlands should
have like a really bad traffic safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the European Union actually tracks the
traffic safety accidents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And statistics is that Netherlands is
about 40% better than the European
[SPEAKER_02]: average.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously it doesn't- Maybe a spurious
correlation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well Joe, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to add this, you know,
the regulation of cannabis is very popular
[SPEAKER_00]: thing in Slovenia since last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every government before the election
promised big things, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there were different law proposals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when this party, or this coalition of
parties come to the power, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they all forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are also unlucky maybe because we
have frequent change of governments,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not the whole mandate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's usually two years if they are
lucky three, if they are very lucky four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in such a weak political system,
then the bureaucrats, as Bosjan said,
[SPEAKER_00]: are leading the dance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I don't know, we cannot
solve problems with the same people who
[SPEAKER_00]: made them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing is to, I think,
to change those people who are in charge
[SPEAKER_00]: for drugs and so for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can just say, I think if we take from
what Bosjan just said and what Bustjan
[SPEAKER_02]: said before, I think it's the people who
need to put pressure on the politics and
[SPEAKER_02]: they can also deal with the administrative
or the administrators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I think putting people like
Professor Neubauer or other people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: treating patients, real life patients with
heavy disease and telling them,
[SPEAKER_02]: listen, we have this patient who we could
help but we cannot because of some
[SPEAKER_02]: bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we will apply pressure to the
politics and then things will change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bustjan, do you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people can relate to those sad
stories and they don't see, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: junkies in Matelkova.
[SPEAKER_04]: They see these people that need help.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's most certainly the way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have to correct or add to my
previous statement.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't talking about corruption bribes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't mix that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought about that later.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the economic incentive that's
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same with taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know if we lower taxes,
if we had, I don't know, 10% flat rate,
[SPEAKER_04]: companies would come to Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I talk to anyone left or right,
they all agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not a populistically good thing
to say or to go into the parliament and
[SPEAKER_04]: say, look, we will lower taxes because we
will have lower invoices, our tax
[SPEAKER_04]: authority, but we will have more invoices.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something we all agree,
but we can't put it into the parliament
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's not populistically okay to
take less money from the rich at the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I definitely know what you meant when
you said that the economic incentives
[SPEAKER_08]: that, because that's what happened in
America.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how we legalized in America.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been an activist since 1993 when I
met Jack Hare and he took me under his
[SPEAKER_08]: wing and I started, and I was an activist,
a volunteer signature gatherer on the
[SPEAKER_08]: street.
[SPEAKER_08]: And our narrative at that time was pushing
cannabis for human rights, civil liberty
[SPEAKER_08]: issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't push it for money or economic
incentive back then.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were activists and we thought,
well, this is a plant and this is our body
[SPEAKER_08]: and you shouldn't be locking people up for
years for this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's kind of where we were coming
from for years until, and then what
[SPEAKER_08]: happened was you had a lot of big
organizations come up after California
[SPEAKER_08]: came in for medical and just giving some
context of how it happened in America a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that that's the same analogy here,
but there is crossover.
[SPEAKER_08]: As we're legalizing in America,
up until the, so there was before the
[SPEAKER_08]: recession, it was a human rights,
civil liberties thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we were pushing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had big organizations like MPP,
Marijuana Policy Project, and Drug Policy
[SPEAKER_08]: Alliance, and they were, they gave,
they started giving big money to campaigns
[SPEAKER_08]: that were starting to do state campaigns.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like here in California, they could give
you a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had some billionaire philanthropists,
whether it was Peter Thiel or George
[SPEAKER_08]: Soros.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are two of the philanthropists
behind those two groups.
[SPEAKER_08]: They started giving money, but the
narrative was still human rights,
[SPEAKER_08]: civil liberties.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't until the recession in 2007,
2008 that the shit really hit the fan in
[SPEAKER_08]: America and around the world, and we
really, the MPP, the top activist,
[SPEAKER_08]: they took, they saw an opening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we're going to push the economic
incentives of cannabis, and that's gonna
[SPEAKER_08]: be our number one thing, because as
political strategists, you never want too
[SPEAKER_08]: much messaging.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll get convoluted.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll dilute itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they started pinpointing on the
economic issues specifically, and
[SPEAKER_08]: unfortunately, it's still, fortunately and
unfortunately, it's still that.
[SPEAKER_08]: People sometimes tend to forget the human
rights aspect of cannabis and just
[SPEAKER_08]: individual liberty in general.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I agree completely, because we
saw that's how, that's what broke the
[SPEAKER_08]: glass ceiling in America.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like when these municipalities and
jurisdictions needed extra revenue,
[SPEAKER_08]: they knew they could easily get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: By legalizing cannabis, and that was
employed in the strategy for legalizing
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's say in Colorado, you say,
well, 10% of this tax or more,
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will go to the schools.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all of a sudden, you have, we'll go to
the police.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you have police and schools
lobbying for your campaign, and like I
[SPEAKER_08]: said, it's not the exact same comparison
here, but I think that and I even think
[SPEAKER_08]: the human rights aspect is still okay to
bring up in Europe, because you have this
[SPEAKER_08]: classic harm prevention strategy over the
years.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not incarcerating people for
personal use generally in Europe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas in America traditionally,
in some of the southern more conservative
[SPEAKER_08]: states, you can go to jail with a joint.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's people in Louisiana right now who
are rotting away in jail for personal use.
[SPEAKER_08]: In other states also, so I would agree
that this is about economics, and when you
[SPEAKER_08]: show people, when I say people,
I really mean institutions, the money,
[SPEAKER_08]: they know that it's a big party and
everybody's included.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one last thing I'll just say is there
was a time also in America, and this is
[SPEAKER_08]: very different from politics in Europe,
we have legal bribery in America.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called lobbying, and it's the most
corrupt, bullshit way to deal with
[SPEAKER_08]: politics, and I've done many, I'm the
first person ever to do a bipartisan
[SPEAKER_08]: fundraiser that I know of in America with
two Washington congressmen, Dana
[SPEAKER_08]: Rohrbacher, you were there though,
at the Jerry Garcia suite at the Hyatt in
[SPEAKER_08]: San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_08]: How apropos for all those who know the
Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the first bipartisan fundraiser,
right, with Earl Blumenhauer, the 40-year
[SPEAKER_08]: congressman, hero from Portland,
and Dana Rohrbacher, the Republican,
[SPEAKER_08]: yet he was a Libertarian Republican
congressman who was, is the hero of
[SPEAKER_08]: America.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if there's any one
politician, ironically enough he was
[SPEAKER_08]: Republican, that did more for,
you might have heard of the
[SPEAKER_08]: Rohrbacher-Blumenhauer, Rohrbacher-Farr
amendment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rohrbacher was the one that if he couldn't
change the law, he could reappropriate the
[SPEAKER_08]: funds that were allocated to the law.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's allocation and there's
appropriation, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it gets allocated, then it gets
appropriated.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they stopped with the
Rohrbacher-Farr amendment, they just said
[SPEAKER_08]: in medical marijuana states, you cannot
raid, you can't use any, law enforcement
[SPEAKER_08]: can't use any resources for medical
marijuana when it's clear state law.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they'd have to be real criminals going
against other RICO stuff like embezzlement
[SPEAKER_08]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a slight digression.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the point is, is I was there when the
politicians wouldn't want to touch it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Only a few people like Rohrbacher and
Blumenhauer were down.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we started this cannabis
constituency and this whole lobbying
[SPEAKER_08]: movement.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then next thing you know, I'm raising
$50,000 for the governor of California.
[SPEAKER_08]: This happened right away, like over a
two-year period.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you say, Ungeil?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it was like, they wouldn't touch it,
the politicians didn't want anything to do
[SPEAKER_08]: with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And next thing you know, we're doing
fundraisers, you know, and shaking hands
[SPEAKER_08]: and wanting to take showers afterwards,
you know, sleeping with the enemy,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that being said, I don't think
Slovenian politics are the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, Bozo, I would ask you,
or Gaspar, did you have something to say
[SPEAKER_08]: on that, Gaspar?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just wanted to add that in contrary
to US thinking, especially in Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_02]: we also have to tackle beside the
politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: The politics aspect, also the public image
of cannabis, and we need to work on
[SPEAKER_02]: improving that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think it's still a lot of
people, like Bustan mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: are still considered cannabis,
like this bad illicit drug that is being
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked on the corners, you know,
by people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't consider it that it's actually
a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna use that word, that it helps a
lot of people, a lot of really sick
[SPEAKER_02]: people, and to improve the image of
cannabis together.
[SPEAKER_02]: The PR representative for cannabis to
improve the image in Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_02]: that I think is the first step besides the
politic aspect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I think that's part of the
political aspect, because that's like the
[SPEAKER_08]: politicians don't want to touch it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the next thing you know, you're doing
big fundraisers for congressmen and
[SPEAKER_08]: senators and governors, and you're like,
it feels like a little Alice in
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderland.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the cool thing is, is I've seen this
happen in three different jurisdictions,
[SPEAKER_08]: California, Oregon, and now what we've
done in Germany.
[SPEAKER_08]: By getting people together and forwarding
the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that that's happening in
Slovenia now.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Bozo, what is, so you say there's
obstacles within the bureaucracy,
[SPEAKER_08]: the long time administrators.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there, what ministry do you think is,
what ministry can help the most?
[SPEAKER_08]: What ministries will be involved when
legalization does happen, or
[SPEAKER_08]: normalization?
[SPEAKER_08]: And what ministry, could you name them,
is holding us back?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most problematic ministry on this part
is Ministry of Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are very unique, because you can
grow cannabis for food, for fiber,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know why they have
jurisdiction on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why it could be agricultural?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even, never, understood why we
have any law about industrial hemp and
[SPEAKER_00]: those things, because hemp for production
of seed and fiber is excluded of single
[SPEAKER_00]: one convention of 61.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, bureaucrats have somehow
succeeded to complicate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that key is, now it's put
together all the industry and science.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I started to, almost 20 years
ago, I already realized that actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: education is the thing where we have to
move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started to organize the seminaries,
scientific conferences back in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whenever we have anything to do with
medical chamber or Ministry of Health,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have done everything to stop us on
this or other ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still strongly believe in this,
if we want to change narratives towards
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, we're still organizing
seminaries for doctors, nurses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I often joke that we have to educate
also journalists, because most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: journalists until now or where they seek
the information is Ministry of Health,
[SPEAKER_00]: National Institute of Public Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are people whom I would not
trust at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that we in Slovenia, we have
already three deaths because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's generally known that nobody died
ever of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still National Institute of Public
Health had three deaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go, you know, it's a bad
light for cannabis and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we have to get rid of those
bureaucrats who are really there for 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years and they stop every move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 2016, Parliament accepted a
decision that they should, Ministry of
[SPEAKER_00]: Health, prepare all legal, you know,
basis to introduce cannabis to medical
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today is 2023, so it's seven years and
nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: Boston, what do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you just tell us how we're gonna
get it all done now, Boston?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of my first meetings at the
Ministry, I told them we need let's say
[SPEAKER_04]: state electronic inboxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was told it can be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, there's a one man band who did
it 10 years ago in the private sector.
[SPEAKER_04]: How is it not possible?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the answer was, look Minister,
ministers change, we stay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I understand, we should change the
bureaucrats, but it's not possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should just be, let the policy should
be strict, should, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: put out a legislative proposal and execute
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the same bureaucrats will do it,
but just you have to give power to the
[SPEAKER_04]: people above them so that they have the
authority.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any hope that the bureaucrats
would change that we could, that that's no
[SPEAKER_08]: hope.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, the realism is seething,
palpable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, that's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you can't beat them,
kind of join them.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to coalesce.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that kind of, make incentivize everyone
to make this a win-win for everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's real.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or just present them with everything so
that they just need to sign off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Present them with a, I don't know,
a draft bill, present them with the
[SPEAKER_02]: studies and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think a lot of them are probably
going to agree, well, just lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, this has been so about this for
so long and so long and why change
[SPEAKER_02]: something?
[SPEAKER_02]: The knives are coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to, I have to emphasize they're not
lazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bureaucratic state of mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I change something, I take a risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I take a risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm responsible because no higher ranked
public office or will take responsibility
[SPEAKER_04]: for the lower one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not in our culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they have strict rules, they follow
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But imagine every time you get to the
administrative unit, there's a line.
[SPEAKER_04]: A person goes by you and gets in front of
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you happy?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you happy with the bureaucrat who let
him or her in?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though they have a, let's say a life
of reason why that person should be in
[SPEAKER_04]: front of you, you don't accept it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You personally don't accept it because you
have rules and rules should be followed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And bureaucrats learn that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were so often criticized for doing
reasonable things against some general
[SPEAKER_04]: rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just follow the general rules now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's something that we impose to the
bureaucrats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we suffer from that same
consequence.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's absolutely fascinating.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, gosh, we're going back to what
you said about what can we take from
[SPEAKER_08]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the best model that we have right
now to push forward in Slovenia is the
[SPEAKER_08]: pilot project model.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the fact that Slovenia has a
rich history of research and development
[SPEAKER_08]: with a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are a very smart, innovative
country.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that is Slovenia's biggest
export right now is research.
[SPEAKER_08]: Research and development and intellectual
property.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just really glad to be here on
this ride with all you guys, you beautiful
[SPEAKER_08]: gentlemen up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for this great panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you give some applause for these guys
right here?
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks guys so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will open it up to questions right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone has any questions for our
esteemed panel members, please shoot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was indeed very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what were my thoughts listening to why
we still don't have all these issues
[SPEAKER_03]: sorted out with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: My question for you was then, OK,
but how do you evaluate the role of
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmacies in this big picture?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they our allies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they making it more difficult because
they see it's kind of a competition with
[SPEAKER_03]: them if we grow our own medicine in our
backyards?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are your thoughts on this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I know, no pharmacy has any
problem to introduce cannabis into there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they just have to have, as Bosjan
said, strict rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe pharmacies and pharmacy faculties
even further than medical faculty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are more open than medical
sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the same system actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't see any problems, but we have
so confused legislation and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 23 years since we adopted this drug law
and still we don't have any, how you say,
[SPEAKER_00]: podzakonski akte.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those lower acts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 23 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the law should not be functional
if I know well, but they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to bring orders as soon as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some tries for years,
but, you know, to change medical system,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And introducing the cannabis into a
medical system is a big change for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say that you have to distinguish
producers and sellers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Producers can see you as a competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sellers never.
[SPEAKER_04]: They sell and if the margin is higher,
they rather sell your product than the
[SPEAKER_04]: other people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And regarding home grow, I think we saw in
Canada when we had companies like Tilray
[SPEAKER_08]: who were lobbying against a home grow
because they thought it would deplete
[SPEAKER_08]: their revenue if people wouldn't go to the
dispensaries then.
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually find that that's the opposite
though.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not, however you feel about home
grow, just because someone can grow a few
[SPEAKER_08]: plants in their house, it doesn't actually
mean that dispensaries in the area will do
[SPEAKER_08]: less.
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually means that they could actually
do more revenue because the market is so
[SPEAKER_08]: primed.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you can only grow one or two
strains, but you go to the dispensary and
[SPEAKER_08]: where I'm from and it's like a kid in a
candy store.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm that kid and it's like,
and it's like, well, I can't make shatter.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't, you know, I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't make dabs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't make this pill with perfectly five
milligrams THC and 0.05.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it just once the market gets
advanced, the home grow just becomes a
[SPEAKER_08]: novelty.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, hey, look at my couple plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can save a little bit of money,
you know, or I could trade it for
[SPEAKER_08]: something else, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how it happens in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can grow plants and plants and plants
in Oregon, but I don't know how many
[SPEAKER_08]: billions of dollars we did just in Oregon
in revenue this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just like to make that point about
homegrown.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can still keep to the human rights
civil liberties aspect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have another question?
[SPEAKER_08]: You got a question?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody's got a question?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is what time will the shuttle
be here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Shuttle will be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: That dang shuttle, those darn shuttles.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody wants to go to Magnifico.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Magnifico is tonight at the castle.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be, I don't know how we're
going to stay.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand it here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's 845.
[SPEAKER_08]: The shuttle goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't forget to tip your waiter.
[SPEAKER_06]: What advice would you all give people?
[SPEAKER_06]: So people want to be politically involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, people want legalization of
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_06]: What all can they do?
[SPEAKER_06]: They could vote.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can threaten, I mean, discuss with
their politicians.
[SPEAKER_06]: What else?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you need big festivals or rallies or
protests?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what is the most effective way here
in Slovenia?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that conferences like this,
like giving knowledge to the people,
[SPEAKER_02]: the professionals and also the general
public.
[SPEAKER_02]: The news gets out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think step by step, this is going to
get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have the processes in America
with the pressure on your representative
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, just getting the knowledge out to
the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how it's only going to get
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wonder why you're saying homegrown
against a company.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Israel, we have only a company that is
providing cannabis to the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is only the way the patients
could buy the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Canada, they allowed to grow whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: But very few patients really did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of the urban population is
looking for a product already had been
[SPEAKER_01]: made and available on the shelves in these
different strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Israel, we are now trying to convince
our parliament that I'm an advisor of
[SPEAKER_01]: Israeli committee of parliament for
cannabis regulation to permit to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: homegrown with a good quality will be
assessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the company could supply cannabis for
the patients together with this pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pharmacies should not concurrent with a
company who should be a self supplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because before reform, we had only company
supply directly to the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they could bring it to the
pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pharmacy has a margin about 30%.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a large amount of money coming to
the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the patients have a huge difficulty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do not have the optimal system of
regulation in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no optimal system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need to have a corporation,
a corporate system that permits people to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy it from the supplier, from the grower,
and from the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the own change, this is a human right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that wasn't a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a statement.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was something that I basically
thought I kind of already said when I talk
[SPEAKER_08]: about this homegrown.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it's a human right also to grow
cannabis, to grow any plant, to grow
[SPEAKER_08]: mushrooms, if you really will.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think whatever God gave us to grow in
our backyards, we should be able to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: But one step at a time.
[SPEAKER_08]: My lawyer is freaking out right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, no, don't say mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_08]: But these are all healing plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to get back to our spiritual
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people don't talk about what
spiritual intelligence is.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know about academic intelligence,
social intelligence.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we really have to get back to a
spiritual intelligence where we have just
[SPEAKER_08]: more feeling and empathy and community in
general and come from the bottom up and
[SPEAKER_08]: not the top down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just want to add to Ilya,
I just don't want to mix the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: sector and public health sector and
personal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And human rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say, if on any field,
it is now very popular, my body,
[SPEAKER_00]: my choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should be also on the field of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I agree that we also had in our
session on science to divide to have
[SPEAKER_05]: different laws for recreational and for
medical.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would just like to add to the
question of what shall we do in Slovenia
[SPEAKER_05]: now?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that as we heard, at the opening,
our president of the government and our
[SPEAKER_05]: coalition now is willing, ready to do
something about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a moment that also all we just
try to go directly to the government,
[SPEAKER_05]: to the representative of the government
and demand that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what to also organize such meetings
within Slovenia, within our politicians.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like let's say the city, the city
government, the mayor of Ljubljana and so
[SPEAKER_05]: on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to move this idea forward and what the
politicians want in the civil society.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we have, for example,
the Association of Oncological Patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is the director here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have also Europa Donna.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the patients with breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they should push along with us to the
idea and carry it out to politicians.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to transfer it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it, Tamara.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it, OK?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have time for one more?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to move on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're out of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 2.45.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's 2.45.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: We run a tight ship.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would think you were from Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not on this beautiful lake coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to take time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex Rogers, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to remind you all that the
shuttle bus leaves at 8.45 for the castle.
[SPEAKER_06]: From in front of the hotel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And wear your pass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring your pass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
