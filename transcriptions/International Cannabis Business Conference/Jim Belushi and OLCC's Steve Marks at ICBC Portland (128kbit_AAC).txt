[SPEAKER_00]: I am grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud to be in Oregon, and I have
gotten to know a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our next speaker I've gotten to know
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty well, he's more than a friend,
he's an acquaintance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, wasn't joking, you got that,
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been in a relationship with him
because we've been discussing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very difficult, to get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of little things going on,
but we've been discussing an opiate trade
[SPEAKER_00]: program to begin here in Portland,
where we can get free marijuana to the
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans, people on the street,
people who have opiate addictions,
[SPEAKER_00]: prescriptions, and I know that every
farmer and every manufacturer in Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: will be glad to donate anything to this
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been talking about it,
Steve is a very smart man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found that the OLCC is my partner,
is my friend, and I'm grateful that they
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am their partner, they are my partner,
and I'm proud to know this man,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud to know all the people who work
for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Steve isn't really that good or
that smart, it's really everyone that
[SPEAKER_00]: works for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these guys are really stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few of them standing back,
wave your hand, they're always in the
[SPEAKER_00]: office, hello, give them a hand,
they make Steve look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he is doing everything he can to make
cannabis work in Oregon, everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: every day, finding solutions, every day
running into more problems than finding
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions and fighting and not giving up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is our director, he is our steward,
and I am proud to introduce the director
[SPEAKER_00]: of the OLCC, Steve Marks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tacos are gonna be early in the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I see him, I wanna put on
sunglasses, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Jim, for that very kind
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I came to know Jim, he requested
a couple hours of my time very early this
[SPEAKER_01]: year, and he came in and talked to me
about his vision for helping people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are one, opioids and addicted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned of his passion for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had some interesting ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I explained to him that we probably
weren't gonna change a schedule one drug
[SPEAKER_01]: with another one, schedule one drug inside
our retail facilities, but that we would
[SPEAKER_01]: look at that and work with it,
and I appreciate his interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has deep personal commitment to this
issue, and it's obviously very personal,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've appreciated his work and look
forward to continue to work with you on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim acknowledged my staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna point out just a few of the
managers and program people, because we've
[SPEAKER_01]: had some changes, some are new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Jason Hansen is in the room
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing the medical part of the
inspections and running that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jason, stand up, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next to him is Shannon Hoffeditz,
who is our public safety director,
[SPEAKER_01]: so she's in charge statewide.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the back is Anthony, and I've only said
your name a couple of times, Glastosky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is doing packaging and labeling for us
now, so he's new to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of you will wanna be talking
with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's TJ Sheehy, who's our data
analyst.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll meet the others on the panel,
but some of the people, and we have others
[SPEAKER_01]: here that support us every day,
a lot of new faces.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing very fast at OOCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, we'll have a panel following
of our staff experts, as Jim Dooley
[SPEAKER_01]: pointed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real expertise behind this operation
will be answering some questions about the
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational program and about new medical
inspections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this morning, I wanna share with you
some ideas on how we can improve the old
[SPEAKER_01]: OOCC system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm not a policymaker, I'm an
administrator.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can't be afraid to put ideas out
there to be publicly discussed,
[SPEAKER_01]: because good ideas and ideas deserve a
healthy public debate and discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I wanna explore is the question
of what we do to move past this remaining
[SPEAKER_01]: clash of values between old regulations
and where we are today and the new times
[SPEAKER_01]: in front of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a point where we can maybe even study
the possibility of an opioid trade program
[SPEAKER_01]: to figure out a research framework for
allowing and then evaluating the
[SPEAKER_01]: transition from opioids to marijuana and
the efficacy of that and the help that it
[SPEAKER_01]: could provide people's lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking about switching schedule
one drugs at our retail, but how do we
[SPEAKER_01]: create a friendlier system for the
physician-patient relationship and to
[SPEAKER_01]: explore this possibility without having to
go outside of our system to make that
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's heartening to me that we have
engaged licensees, many of you for many
[SPEAKER_01]: years, and Jim, who are in this to figure
that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna help make Oregon's regulated
cannabis system open to all Oregonians.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's very, very important to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2014, when voters passed ballot measure
91, there were a lot of skeptics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skeptics, maybe even many of you in this
room, that questioned whether OLCC was the
[SPEAKER_01]: right place to regulate cannabis in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: By reputation or mythology, our agency
wasn't well regarded by the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the three short years since then,
we've put together a system that now
[SPEAKER_01]: allows consumers to purchase safe cannabis
products legitimately produced by our
[SPEAKER_01]: licensees in a regulated system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the system is very imperfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the progress we've made, our arrival
at this point is because we listened and
[SPEAKER_01]: consulted and worked with you and work
with this industry, which has produced a
[SPEAKER_01]: great range of products exactly what
measure 91 envisioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we're a regulatory agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of us as a consumer protection
agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, we have some responsibilities for
medical marijuana, which means that we
[SPEAKER_01]: need to care about patients and customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we've been doing the same with the
medical marijuana community, listening,
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting, and working, where we have
oversight and influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's despite the fact of our recent
decision to limit the quantities of flour
[SPEAKER_01]: available to medical patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to acknowledge that going
forward, we have to be more closely,
[SPEAKER_01]: or we have to work more closely with the
Cannabis Commission before taking action
[SPEAKER_01]: that impacts patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although in this instance, I think we were
justified in taking the emergency action
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the serious nature of the
abuses and because the problem remained as
[SPEAKER_01]: a systemic weakness in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just point out that there are other
avenues for those patients today,
[SPEAKER_01]: which didn't limit concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, you can still get shared flour,
and there are remaining dispensaries for
[SPEAKER_01]: people to get their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also some very good ideas that
came forward at the Rules Advisory
[SPEAKER_01]: Committee, putting in place a monthly
aggregated limit if we can manage that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dr. Knox talked about an A and B
medical card that would entitle people to
[SPEAKER_01]: greater quantities of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to see us work with you to
find a solution in the coming months.
[SPEAKER_01]: But while Oregon has crafted a set of
rules enabling the cannabis industry to
[SPEAKER_01]: emerge as a significant force in the
state's legal economy, we have an
[SPEAKER_01]: obligation to Oregonians at OCC to ensure
that product produced in our state does
[SPEAKER_01]: not find its way into illegal markets and
does not cross state lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three years ago, our agency's initial
focus was to establish a licensee supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: This meant that in addition to licensing
brand new cannabis businesses,
[SPEAKER_01]: we also needed to facilitate the transfer
of medical growers, processors,
[SPEAKER_01]: and dispensaries into our regulated
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've done that, which is why now our
focus has shifted to oversight of those
[SPEAKER_01]: 2,000 plus licensees that are in our
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's been evident through
our compliance activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been out doing minor decoy
operations with retailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been using the cannabis data
tracking system to detect irregular and
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially illegal activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've required outdoor producers to
notify us when there's a harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's some discussion about that,
but I think we made it an easy button that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can hit the morning of harvest to
schedule that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can report to you that we're out
there in Operation Good Harvest right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a saturation inspection effort of
all outdoor grows or outdoor grows that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's underway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was down in southern Oregon last week,
and the results are, I think, heartening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventy percent of our licensees that are
being inspected have no issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should applaud those folks for
meeting a complicated set of regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: structures and doing it well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another maybe 20 percent have some
challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to need some education.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be some violations,
some level of fines, but there's things
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get past in about another 10
percent of our licensees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to be upward of 400,
500 inspections during the course of
[SPEAKER_01]: crop-tober harvest season in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just as when we started the minor
decoy problem and then saw,
[SPEAKER_01]: correspondingly, better results,
I'm hoping that we're going to see a
little bit of improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we see even better results as the
Good Harvest operation continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's certainly my hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are the kind of steps that we
need to take to make sure that our
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated system isn't so porous that it's
predictably leaking product into the
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We owe that to voters, elected officials,
Oregonians who placed their confidence in
[SPEAKER_01]: us to establish this new legal cannabis
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: All Oregonians and the industry are
getting what they should expect from us,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we are doing our job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a legal regulated adult use system
may have only been a pipe dream in earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: generations of growers rooted in Oregon's
storied cannabis history, but their
[SPEAKER_01]: pioneering efforts did pave the way for
the establishment of Oregon's medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we're all aware that the
creation and ascension of the adult use
[SPEAKER_01]: system has had a tremendously disruptive
impact on the OMMP system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were promises made in good faith to
not harm the medical program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Establishing the recreational system has
resulted in patients getting separated
[SPEAKER_01]: from growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today, many medical marijuana grows
are tracked in the cannabis tracking
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The framework supporting the medical
marijuana system is changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not through any fault of policymakers or
advocates, but because the rules were put
[SPEAKER_01]: in place at a different time, in a
different era, and they stand in stark
[SPEAKER_01]: contrast to where we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we want to make sure that the rapid
development of the recreational marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace does not eclipse the needs of
medical patients who truly and
[SPEAKER_01]: legitimately need access to their cannabis
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Navigating a course to ensure patient
access requires us to use existing
[SPEAKER_01]: guideposts so that we focus on what works
in practice, as well as what works in good
[SPEAKER_01]: public policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Oregon Medical Marijuana Act has
provided some of our state's physician
[SPEAKER_01]: pathways to using cannabis to treat
individual patients with a range of
[SPEAKER_01]: ailments and illnesses, and in doing so,
to understand the efficacy of its medical
[SPEAKER_01]: properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: The knowledge generated from charting this
application of medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: while untested by the rigors of medical
trials, provides guardrails for Oregon to
[SPEAKER_01]: establish additional safeguards,
standardizing doctor-patient relationships
[SPEAKER_01]: where this treatment approach can be more
widely considered and understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the conventional wisdom around
prescribing cannabis continues to shift to
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciate its medical and palliative
effects, the OCC will work with the Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Commission as they chart a course
that helps more MDs become comfortable in
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribing medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do this because OMA is 20 years
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's due for a refresh, an upgrade,
that still contains its structure and
[SPEAKER_01]: fundamental foundation of making sure that
patients are able to obtain their
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years ago, OMMP dispensaries began
migrating into the OCC system,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we worked to ensure that medical grade
products were available within that
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, medical grade marijuana products
represent anywhere between 10 to 15% of
[SPEAKER_01]: overall cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: But patients' ability to consistently
obtain medical grade cannabis has been
[SPEAKER_01]: altered by the realignment of dispensaries
becoming OCC retailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The OCC already allows cannabis delivery,
but it's restricted to cities and county
[SPEAKER_01]: locations where the retailers operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those OMMP cardholders who are
infirmed or don't live near OCC
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries, or one of the few remaining
dispensaries in the OMMP, we need to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at creating a delivery system that works
for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as the traditional practice of
medicine utilizes targeted treatments to
[SPEAKER_01]: combat illness and disease, medical
marijuana patients depend on specific
[SPEAKER_01]: strains of products to treat their
ailments and conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to work with OCC producers to
ensure that the strain development that
[SPEAKER_01]: focuses on what patients need,
what delivers positive patient outcomes
[SPEAKER_01]: for them and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means ensuring that producers are
able to provide their craft products to
[SPEAKER_01]: our retailers who can then deliver them
into the hands of medical patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: This underscores another gap, and a gap
organ can help close, creating an
[SPEAKER_01]: environment that supports bona fide
patient research.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hemmed in by the limitations of
federal law and regulations, but again,
[SPEAKER_01]: in cooperation with the Cannabis
Commission, we need to examine new ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: fund, structure and conduct research about
cannabis' medical benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: In turn, we need the Cannabis Commission
to provide us the guidelines on patient
[SPEAKER_01]: dosage and supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, all these concepts that I've shared
with you are not available under OCC's
[SPEAKER_01]: system today, and many of them aren't even
under our jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to policy makers and the industry
working together to move from the old
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery model to a new delivery model
that treats cannabis as medicine as a
[SPEAKER_01]: time-tested medical model resembling
traditional pharmacies that could
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiate medical needs with
appropriate strains and dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly a commonly understood
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such an approach to dispensing cannabis
medicine would ensure plentiful cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: for patients battling debilitating
diseases and illness and sufficient
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of cannabis for patients with
minor maladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Dr. Rachel Knox suggested at our Rules
Advisory Committee meeting, perhaps we
[SPEAKER_01]: should have an A and B medical card that
would allow that distinction to be made at
[SPEAKER_01]: the retail level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my commitment for our agency is that we
will keep open the avenues for enhanced
[SPEAKER_01]: patient accessibility as we become a
greater point of contact for patients
[SPEAKER_01]: because of our scale, our size and our
distribution channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clear that OCC is statewide.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have more retail operations than
Starbucks does in this state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the opportunity to use that to do
the job better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're gonna need your help working
with the Cannabis Commission, the
[SPEAKER_01]: legislature, as we work through the
ethical and economic and value clashes
[SPEAKER_01]: that limit our ability to provide the
right services to the right patients at
[SPEAKER_01]: the right time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever's decided, we'll implement it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now's the time to rethink and reimagine
our role with the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: community just as the commercial cannabis
community reimagined its role with us
[SPEAKER_01]: three years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for three years from now, and three
years from now, Oregon is as well known
[SPEAKER_01]: for being patient-friendly as it is for
providing consumer access to quality
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in a well-regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think we're all looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much and the panel will
follow.
