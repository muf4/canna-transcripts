[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our third iteration in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started this out about seven,
eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started it in Oregon, and I thought one
day we're going to become international,
[SPEAKER_01]: and eventually we became international.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our two big events are here in Barcelona,
and our flagship event is in Berlin this
[SPEAKER_01]: summer, June 29th and 30th, and that will
be our sixth edition in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ICBC, we only have one rule,
and that's don't be a dick and treat
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody with respect and love,
because the ICBC is more than just a
[SPEAKER_01]: conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a family, and we are, we're very,
we're in honor of the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant, the cannabis plant,
because if it wasn't for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, we would not all be here together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis does a lot of things for the
world, whether it's medical, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental, whether it's just to be
able to chill with your friends and have a
[SPEAKER_01]: good time, and of course we know
incarcerating people for using cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: a ridiculous idea, and prohibition does
not work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here for business, and the business,
I found out, the more you perpetuate the
[SPEAKER_01]: business, the more you perpetuate the
politics and move the public policy
[SPEAKER_01]: forward, and that's what we're here to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here to do business, to approach,
to talk to each other, to create with each
[SPEAKER_01]: other, and today there will be tens of
millions of dollars of business that gets
[SPEAKER_01]: done and manifests itself immediately or
residualy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Alex Rogers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the founder of the ICBC, and I want
to give my heartfelt thanks to you guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'd like to have you guys give
yourself a round of applause for being
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please make some noise for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is an honor to be here in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without further ado, I would like to
introduce our emcee for the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he is our emcee for all ICBC events
for the last 30 we have done over the last
[SPEAKER_01]: eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, please give it up
for Ungay Obido.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more time for Alex, who put the whole
thing together, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's his idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's James.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bienvenido a Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bienvenu.
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak English.
[SPEAKER_00]: Necesito que practicarme espa√±ol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suficientemente para comer y fumar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, y amor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, but a couple quick
announcements first of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the after party tonight at nine
o'clock at the Ritz Arts Hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't gotten a ticket yet,
we're selling some here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them for like 200 euros.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it off the Eventbrite app.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can talk to Jessie.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll hook you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, tickets for Berlin are on sale for
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you've come out here today,
you can get a discounted ticket for
[SPEAKER_00]: Berlin, which is gonna be in late June,
and it's twice as big as this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our biggest event, and it's
fantastic, and we love to see you
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just follow us around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will follow you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Four times as big, according to Alex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's big, big, big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, big, big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four times as big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, big, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said four bigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, big, big, big.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
