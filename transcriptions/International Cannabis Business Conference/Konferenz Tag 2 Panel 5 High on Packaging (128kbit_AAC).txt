[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for showing up to the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, cannabis packaging is a
great topic because, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's the first thing that your customers
see but quite often it's the last thing
[SPEAKER_05]: that's mapped out in the entire operation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very blessed to have a great panel
spanning, you know, a few different
[SPEAKER_05]: countries and it would be great to just
draw, you know, some experience and
[SPEAKER_05]: inspiration from everybody's stories.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm from ND Supplies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a global supplier of packaging
products specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Specifically for the cannabis industry
based in Canada but now global.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm very, very fortunate to have,
you know, all these other experts from
[SPEAKER_05]: around the world joining me here today
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of the topics I'd like to touch on
today, sustainability, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and consumer use and just overall
packaging design.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like to, you know, introduce my
panelists.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can all introduce yourselves,
that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll start.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Jack Hill.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm with Chubby Gorilla.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are based in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are also a global package manager.
[SPEAKER_04]: Started in e-liquids and now we were in
cannabis and we package a lot of other
[SPEAKER_04]: things as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Petra Marinko.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come from Pharma G company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started a brand, Nabi.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't do packaging but we use really
good packaging and we know how to design a
[SPEAKER_02]: good package.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of shows what you want to
present with a good package.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm here to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Felix Bischoping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm CEO of Pakiro.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a German company also supplying
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started, our idea was basically
that we have a solution for small amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: of packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very flexible in our production
so we can produce very small amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: big amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we started 2020,
we directly saw that there is a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: demand in the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think since that in Germany at least
most of the CBD companies know us and we
[SPEAKER_00]: help them with our packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So packaging, it's one of those things
that a lot of people do struggle to
[SPEAKER_05]: unwrap.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when it comes to us in Canada,
for example, there's a lot of regulations
[SPEAKER_05]: when it comes to how cannabis is packaged,
what kind of materials you're able to use.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first and foremost is packaging design
and how that relates to your brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe Petra, you can lead us off by
saying that what's your thought process
[SPEAKER_05]: when it comes to how your package is
designed and how does that work out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm an architect by profession,
so I'm a visual type of person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe that we all are really
visual.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are really visual.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the design of the packaging is the
first thing that people see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you do a good thing, then people
take your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take it into the hand and they can
feel the product, have an experience with
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's really important
regarding the design and branding and also
[SPEAKER_02]: materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are doing a lot of different
materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other point of view that we chose
was also, and it was really important for
[SPEAKER_02]: us, was reuse, not only being recyclable,
but to let people reuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use our tubes, which are really
useful because you can have your product
[SPEAKER_02]: in your tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put a tube inside a drawer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have it packed like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: People use it for cables.
[SPEAKER_02]: People use it for screws, for different
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get creative with the packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was one of the most important
things for us to get people our box and
[SPEAKER_02]: reuse it again, not just throw it out and
that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other aspect that we were really
paying attention to was the microplastics
[SPEAKER_02]: that come into the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really hard for us to find
packaging for creams, lotions,
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like that without plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every part of a lotion pump is made out of
plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So switching to tubes for us was a really
big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ditched the plastics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ditched everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is 99% recyclable and aluminum.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love how that's part of your brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you did mention also that your
aluminum tubes are locally sourced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that helps a lot too with the overall
carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the reasons why we decided
the tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The production company of the tubes is
five kilometers from where we are
[SPEAKER_02]: stationed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's zero impact on the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually really easy to
manipulate with the products that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have everything by your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first line that we did, we got it from
China.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really well-made, premium products.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tested everything for migration of
batches.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put that stuff into the products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything worked fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was expensive, and it took a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those kind of things, if you're
pivoting through the regulations of the
[SPEAKER_02]: CVD and everything, you need fast
delivery, lower quantities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can have this.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So speaking of regulations, Jack,
you're coming from the American market,
[SPEAKER_05]: the US market.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're branding and things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot more liberal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you go through some of the processes
with design in the States?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know in Canada, everything is
very, very muted.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish we had the freedom that you did.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe you can go over some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say packaging in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_04]: Branding is everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marketing is everything, because you have
some of the largest names, biggest brands
[SPEAKER_04]: in cannabis who are going to be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And going into a dispensary in the States,
it is a circus of colors, shapes,
[SPEAKER_04]: images, everything you imagine on a mylar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is radically different from going
into a Canadian dispensary, where all that
[SPEAKER_04]: is minimalized to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my company, Chubby Gorilla,
that is what we cater to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we call ourselves a specialty packaging
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will get your Pantone color.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will get your logo and then actually
turn the packaging into that color.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also partner with a lot of companies
like Petrus who actually focus on the
[SPEAKER_04]: design of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we say, hey, we will make packaging
for you that you sell through to your
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do that for our customers as well,
because they're far more better at the
[SPEAKER_04]: design aspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would just rather make the custom
packaging for whatever the functionality
[SPEAKER_04]: that's needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the biggest difference that I
see in the markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then even if I say the US market in
general, I could spend another hour just
[SPEAKER_04]: talking by state by state, because they
still haven't had a agreed upon for what
[SPEAKER_04]: the whole country is going to have as far
as their packaging standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: But branding is definitely a key part of
the market that we play in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you for your insight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now Felix, you've been in the flexible
packaging game for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you see branding and things like
that play out in the German market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's the same with
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you often look at the product,
they basically look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you talk about coffee or CBD or
whatever, you cannot really judge how good
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality is just by looking at the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the marketing aspect of the packaging
is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's the same in Germany or
all over Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's no difference to the
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, I think that there is a change
currently in the market because,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, big brands were only making
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the coffee brands in
Germany, you had like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, 30 a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now more and more of the small coffee
brands appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're super creative with the
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with their design, with the packaging,
they want to have an outstanding
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging, so really to distinguish them
from the others, especially from the big
[SPEAKER_00]: brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make them special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you can see all over Europe
that these small players appear and are
[SPEAKER_00]: super creative with the packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's dream a little bit now and just
imagine that cannabis as an industry did
[SPEAKER_05]: legalize.
[SPEAKER_05]: How would that affect packaging in
Germany, Slovenia, and in the US?
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_05]: In your opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very open question, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also like, we're here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's very optimistic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's dream a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the industry is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a big discussion, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, really, at the moment,
nobody can say exactly how it will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's certain aspects which will be
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one important aspect is what
will be the distribution channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either it will be mostly done via
pharmacies, or it will be done a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit like the way in the Dutch market,
where it's way more recreational and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have coffee shops and all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it will go the direction of the
pharmacies, it will be kind of more,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, so kind of the pharmacy-looking
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it goes more to the recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be more like aggressive marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a discussion,
because similar to the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is not allowed to print kind of
marketing stuff anymore on tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be also an option for the
legislation at the moment, that they
[SPEAKER_00]: really say, OK, the packaging needs to be
completely gray, and maybe only the logo
[SPEAKER_00]: will be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really a discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really kind of in the
middle of this discussion at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other aspects will be also important,
like sustainability, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then traceability, so that you can really
trace the packaging back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, also a little bit kind of
protection stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even for smaller, like mailer bags,
you will need something kind of sort of as
[SPEAKER_00]: child protection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Petra?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would more focus on the design point of
view.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, sustainability and everything
that Felix said is the same in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But regarding design, I think the
minimalism that we kind of also wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: present with our product is becoming more
it's maybe more people use it more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get distracted every day by so many
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by so many information on the
packaging, you get lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody is trying to stand out in a
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for example, for us, it was easy,
because in cannabis business, everything
[SPEAKER_02]: is green or black.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, OK, so we'll be white.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in different kind of product
development and products placing on the
[SPEAKER_02]: market, I see the minimalism going to the
little information, less colors,
[SPEAKER_02]: less vibrant, or a different one in more
colors and everything just shiny and so
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to pivot.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trends that are coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because on our side of the world,
it's like there are very, very heavy
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish we were more like you guys,
Jack, and we would have a little bit more
[SPEAKER_05]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if the US is to ever legalize
federally, do you think that would change
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis packaging anyway?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think the biggest thing that's
going to change is that once we have
[SPEAKER_04]: federal wide open, now it becomes truly
creative.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've seen some people get really
creative with the products that they want
[SPEAKER_04]: to offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen drinking straws that would have
powder in them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way, you put the straw on the
drink, and you shake it up, and then
[SPEAKER_04]: you're good to go, and you drink with the
straw.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as soon as these things come about,
though, the biggest thing that happens
[SPEAKER_04]: then, it all turns into regulation and
compliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where really we see a lot going
on in the state of California to make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: that you have all your ISO certifications,
to make sure you have your GMP,
[SPEAKER_04]: to allow for the flexibility and the
creativity that people want to have now
[SPEAKER_04]: that you have everything federally
regulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really what we focus on,
just to make sure that everyone has the
[SPEAKER_04]: certifications that they need,
and then they can get as creative as they
[SPEAKER_04]: want to get.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there currently any certifications
needed for packaging in Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not written down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there is a discussion about GMP
and on some ISO norms, which probably will
[SPEAKER_00]: be the standard, but when it comes to
pharmacy, you definitely have to look way
[SPEAKER_00]: more into the pharmacy sector than into
normal food licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there child resistance certification
needed, maybe food testing, FDA testing
[SPEAKER_05]: needed, and things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, food is easier than farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, every good packaging
production is somehow certified for food.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMP and pharmacy is always the next step,
and this is something you normally have to
[SPEAKER_00]: implement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the next question really would be
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, cannabis at its roots is a very
grassroots-based kind of industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's kind of meeting the middle ground
between the corporate side of and the
[SPEAKER_05]: business side of cannabis, plus meeting
the grassroots side, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sustainability is right in the middle
of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in Canada, at least, we have a decent
recycling program.
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany, obviously, is a global leader in
recycling and things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what kind of materials and what kind of
packaging do you see being the leader in
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's definitely called mono
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically have to produce the
packaging out of one plastic material,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you basically get all the
certification that it is recyclable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either you choose PPP or whatever
plastic, it needs to be one, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a good chance to be recycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the EU will basically, next year,
in the middle of next year, will kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss or basically close a new law,
which is called PPWR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will basically want to harmonize
all the sustainability laws across Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will be super big, because the
changes will be big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be always about recyclability,
not so much about bioplastics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bioplastics are a little bit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still in the discussion,
but it really looks like more super
[SPEAKER_00]: recyclable and reuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Petra just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the EU will dramatically push,
especially for the whole talent
[SPEAKER_00]: gastronomic sector, reuse concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, yeah, sustainability will not
be an option anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be mandatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised that there are no cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is a great material also for
packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many on the, so little on the
market and so many other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're having that conversation the
other day where we're talking about hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp is such a great product.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many things you can do with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you were to break it down,
if you were to use hemp plastic,
[SPEAKER_05]: for example, it's still a compound.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still a hybrid of plastic and hemp,
which still ends up in the landfill.
[SPEAKER_05]: So until we come up with something that's
fully compostable, made out of hemp,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're still a little bit behind on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are many ways, for example,
like an egg cartoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be easily made out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to have that kind of
packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the biggest thing is we have to
look at the almost cradle to the grave for
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of these products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so where I agree with you,
there is a lot of hemp that could be used.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still has to go through the regulatory
and compliance testing, especially at the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of it will fall way short of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also things that we say,
hey, we could use more paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I look about who else is using
paper in the paper industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are we doing to make sure that we
can grow the paper back as far as
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainable forest?
[SPEAKER_04]: We also look at materials like glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we say, OK, glass, the gold star of
recycling.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a lot more heat to melt glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just don't get it from the sand on
the beach.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to disturb marine environments to
be able to dredge that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So overall, the footprint for a company
like mine, we try to look at the entire
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective and say, what makes the most
sense in certain markets?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what is going to work when it
actually comes to testing and compliance?
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think a lot of packaging companies
are starting to explore this to answer
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the questions that you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we're limited by the state or
the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes we're limited by what is
ultimately going to go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I see the most promising option
currently with hemp is paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also, when it comes to the legislation
about sustainability, it's always about
[SPEAKER_00]: recyclability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a recyclable paper which is
made out of hemp, which is possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have a good solution because
one hand, recyclable, on the other hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried it already a couple of times
on our machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to find a good paper
which is manufacturable with printing,
[SPEAKER_00]: with spec making, whatsoever, with paper
made out of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it will be possible next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any government grants or
programs that support research like this
[SPEAKER_05]: here in your respective countries?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EU is pushing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany is pushing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think that there's really so
much demand actually currently on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market that you really can also push
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Belgium will set up a law on the
1st of January, which will be super
[SPEAKER_00]: strict.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, it will be too expensive to
bring non-recyclable packaging to the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, nobody will do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a really good point is that we
also have to watch what is the ultimate
[SPEAKER_04]: cost going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if we don't price it just right,
then you're going to have a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: section of the non-metric market,
black market, if you will, that will just
[SPEAKER_04]: go and find other packaging to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to find that sweet spot of does
it meet our collective sustainability
[SPEAKER_04]: requirements?
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, can we offer at a good market
price where people will have the demand to
[SPEAKER_04]: actually get it from us?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's a lot of boxes to check off,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, like taking a look at the
Canadian model, for example, like the
[SPEAKER_05]: companies there, there's not very
profitable between high taxes and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, still trying to roll things out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't leave a lot of room for profit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, for us, for example,
if I was to say, hey, you know what,
[SPEAKER_05]: a plastic tube costs you, let's just say,
five cents.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want to be sustainable,
are you willing to pay 30%, 40%,
[SPEAKER_05]: 50%, 60% more?
[SPEAKER_05]: And most companies, as much as they would
love to, they just can't afford it right
[SPEAKER_05]: now because you still got to keep the
lights on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to keep the operation going.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, like you said, how are we
going to come together to alleviate that,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I still think, you know,
technologically and all those things like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, where we are as an industry,
we're just not there yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, eventually, events like
this really come, allows us to come
[SPEAKER_05]: together and really kind of meld our minds
and share our knowledge to eventually
[SPEAKER_05]: figure that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because cannabis, you know, in Canada,
it's five years in.
[SPEAKER_05]: In most of the other countries,
it's just starting, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we have a lot of time to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm glad we're able to sit down and go
over these topics, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, if there's any questions in
the audience later, we'd love to answer
[SPEAKER_05]: that as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any questions from the audience?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are there any?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wake up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so let's go back to sustainability
then, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's one of the biggest topics,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, in America and in the States,
I see there's a lot of, there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: innovation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm seeing, you know, like ocean recycled
plastic, post-consumer recycled plastic,
[SPEAKER_05]: and even composable plastics.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think is the front-runner for
materials in the long run?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the biggest one right now is going
to be the one that the food and drug
[SPEAKER_04]: industry is using in the States,
and that is a certain percentage of
[SPEAKER_04]: post-recycled material.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think both New York in 2024 is going
to demand 35% be post-recycled material.
[SPEAKER_04]: California may follow that, but if any of
you know California, it's just whatever it
[SPEAKER_04]: is that they want to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they don't recognize compostable,
and they really don't recognize
[SPEAKER_04]: biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I can't even get the two states to
follow that right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that will be the first phase,
and then after that they will start to
[SPEAKER_04]: increase what that percentage is as we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as we approach that threshold of
45 to 50%, then probably some compliance
[SPEAKER_04]: will need to come into play to see if the
pharmaceutical company is comfortable with
[SPEAKER_04]: that amount of recycled material,
and where that's coming from, and how
[SPEAKER_04]: clean and how processed that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's kind of where I see the window
going.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Felix, you have quite a few
sustainable options in your portfolio.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you see as the most popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most popular currently is really the
recyclable packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, I mean, being honest, I mean,
recyclable packaging is only new packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: which can be recycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we don't close the circle here at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's really only the first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, we write a lot of blog texts
and try to explain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody also misunderstands often
recyclable with it is already recycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they said, hey, we got recycled
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any thought to like reusable
packaging?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you bring in a glass jar?
[SPEAKER_03]: Reuse will be big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reuse will be a big topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have one aspect of reusable that
it's not many times seen, and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: toxicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you use plastic and reuse it
and reheat it again and make the
[SPEAKER_02]: processes...
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking like glass or some things
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glass can be tricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand sometimes the necessity for
childproof packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently, I'm not as smart as a
child because it is very hard to open.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel bad for some people who may
have arthritis or problems and things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the liquor bottle is not
childproof packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's probably way more dangerous to
your kids than a five milligram gummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's any pushback toward that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you guys just do whatever the state
says?
[SPEAKER_00]: The test, it was very funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we had in Germany, it's called
TUF, T-U-U, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's checking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they told us how they check it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they give it to 10 people who are over
70 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to still open the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to 10 people who are below seven years
old, such kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they shouldn't be able to open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you pass the test.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, in Canada, it's very
important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every package going through retailers has
to be certified child resistant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we independently certify all our
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we take that into consideration,
too, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to make sure that medical
patients and recreational patients are
[SPEAKER_05]: able to open it easily without any issues
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, having a child resistant
mechanism, it varies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's finicky.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're using a bag, sometimes you got
to stick your finger in and kind of pull
[SPEAKER_05]: it through a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know exactly what I mean to you,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Scissors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scissors work, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then now you can't reclose it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's not child resistant anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of things we're trying to
map on a workout.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's rolled out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I said, the opportunities like
this to get together really allows us to
[SPEAKER_05]: dial it in a little bit and get a little
bit more feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, we're faced with price
compression at that store.
[SPEAKER_01]: So packaging is a part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the consumers are relying on the
highest TSC for the best price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reality of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But however, when they get our packaging,
sometimes they're like, where is no
[SPEAKER_01]: recycling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is no medical hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: And all those options are higher cost,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the industry doing to get to a
better medium, like to a better place for
[SPEAKER_01]: us to do the right thing, but also be able
to compete at the store level?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I could start with, from a
Canadian point of view, it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_05]: we have to work together, really,
and come out and see what the budget is
[SPEAKER_05]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we do, what we specialize in is
working with our clients to figure out
[SPEAKER_05]: what your budget is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can build something around that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We spend a lot of time in the field doing
R&D.
[SPEAKER_05]: We visit a lot of sites just to try to see
how to make things easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, I think instead of
looking at the upfront costs, it's also
[SPEAKER_05]: about, how can we make your production
more efficient?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather spend a few cents more upfront
and save you a few salaries on the back
[SPEAKER_05]: end.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where we're going to see these
savings.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is no real hard answer right now
to that, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys have any insight on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I can think of to add to
that is that we try to offer different
[SPEAKER_04]: tiers of products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully there might be a tier above
or below that's going to meet your right
[SPEAKER_04]: price range.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also we have other ways,
because it might just be distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the shipping cost to be able to
get it to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: If I have a different place where I can
move a warehouse or a hub that's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be more suitable, I try to find other ways
to help your business out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also just coming up with
innovative ways to be able to close and
[SPEAKER_04]: seal a product.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can eliminate two machines that you
would have on a line, or maybe eliminate
[SPEAKER_04]: the use of shrink wrapping and other
materials, that might also be a healthy
[SPEAKER_04]: savings for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you might go in the direction of my
packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we try to look at it from that point of
view.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any other questions in the
crowd?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wearing comfortable shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can run right up to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you see in the future?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we talk about that already?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I miss it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I love to be a dreamer, but I'm also
a realist.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the future is undefined.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that's a very general thing to
say.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like I said, it all comes back to the
industry and the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: How can we build a cannabis industry that
we can all love and respect and profit at
[SPEAKER_05]: the same time?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a lot of open space here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And collaborations like this is what it's
really about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the industry will hate me for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think no packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: No packaging?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called single-use packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the packaging that we talk about
currently is that you use the packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this will have an end in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is something we invented
something in the last 30, 40 years where
[SPEAKER_00]: resources were all over the place and
nobody cared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the only reason why you come to
such a stupid idea like single-use
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this will have an end in the
next 10 to 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we only have reused packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly believe in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that we don't use single-use
packaging anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do, then it will need to be
fully recycled and really use the material
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards again for new packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either we close the circle or we only
have reused packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think it will stay the same as
it is today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I do love the idea of reused
packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're actually kicking the idea around
back in Canada and how we have to collect
[SPEAKER_05]: everything though.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a huge undertaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were some clubs in Los Angeles and
Oakland and Berkeley who they would give
[SPEAKER_03]: you a discount if you brought your glass
jar back and then they will wash it out
[SPEAKER_03]: and reuse it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is before everything had to be,
it was more deli style, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You build a lot of the big jar weed and
you get the chopsticks and you put it in
[SPEAKER_03]: the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now everything has to be individually
packaged, which is very weird to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also you get all those beautiful loud
packs and everybody's got the super
[SPEAKER_03]: colorful packaging and it's got a football
player on it and all these other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it looks like a pinata.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if we're here, we're optimistic,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very glad that everybody did show
up and join us for this panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to thank all our great panelists.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a great time up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope everybody gets a little takeaway
from everything regarding packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you ICBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope to see you guys again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it again for Kevin Lee and
Petra and Felix and Jack Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
