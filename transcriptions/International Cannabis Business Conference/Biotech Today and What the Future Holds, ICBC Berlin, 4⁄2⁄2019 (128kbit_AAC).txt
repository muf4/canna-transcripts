[SPEAKER_05]: So why don't we just start with a very,
very quick round of quick introductions to
[SPEAKER_05]: keep this moving like, hi, I'm with this
company, and then we'll move into some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the questions and conversation that I want
to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Ben Adams.
[SPEAKER_09]: I work with Filos Vitalscience.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're a cannabis genomics company based
out of Portland, Oregon in the United
[SPEAKER_09]: States.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Arash Mugani.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the CTO at Avikanga.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're a Toronto-based biopharma company
located at the Johnson & Johnson
[SPEAKER_07]: Innovation Incubator J-Labs, and we also
cultivate and collaborate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do R&D and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Sheldon Kroon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm with Atlas Biotechnologies,
founder, president, and CEO.
[SPEAKER_08]: We produce and process cannabis in
Edmonton, Alberta, Canada as a licensed
[SPEAKER_08]: producer, and we're currently opening
operations in Denmark and the UK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to ask an obvious
question here.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you think of biotechnology in the
cannabis industry, what exactly does that
[SPEAKER_04]: mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it mean research?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it mean labs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it mean testing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it mean growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it mean formulations?
[SPEAKER_04]: What exactly does that mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's probably going to mean
something different to each one of us and
[SPEAKER_09]: probably specific to what we each do.
[SPEAKER_09]: So biotechnology in cannabis to me means
breeding essentially intensive breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you say breeding, you mean that's
like what's separating the girls from the
[SPEAKER_04]: boys?
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to do that dynamic,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say more that the varieties available
on the market today specifically are going
[SPEAKER_09]: to be like Model T cars within five years.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll be completely outdated and totally
useless in many ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you say that, can you give specifics?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So cannabis itself has never undergone
intensive breeding efforts, and so because
[SPEAKER_09]: of the ways that the laws have changed,
many biotechnology companies, including
[SPEAKER_09]: Biolist, which has collected the most
genetic data on cannabis in the world,
[SPEAKER_09]: can now do intensive breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can breed in agronomic traits to
this point and not just breed for ITFC or
[SPEAKER_09]: SCBDs.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can breed for specific flowering times,
specific cannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yield, of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the baseline for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the breeding, and for me it's the
breeding, but also the formulations
[SPEAKER_08]: attached to basically what you breed for.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you want a different amount of
cannabinoids in a specific compound,
[SPEAKER_08]: say it's CBG for instance, you can breed
for the CBG.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what you said is true.
[SPEAKER_08]: Certain genetics on the market today will
be probably obsolete in a few years from
[SPEAKER_08]: now just because of the amount of breeding
that's going on right now and breeding for
[SPEAKER_08]: specific cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_08]: What happens then is in the formulation
side of things, which is what we
[SPEAKER_08]: specialize in, it's important to realize
that the genetics really dictates what you
[SPEAKER_08]: can pull out as your ultimate yield from
that particular strain or cultivar,
[SPEAKER_08]: as I prefer to call them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So essentially the way I look at biotech
right now, in this industry at least,
[SPEAKER_08]: is that it's really about what you can
grow or basically breed for, then what you
[SPEAKER_08]: can pull out of that plant and then
formulate from the specific compounds that
[SPEAKER_08]: you breed for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that kind of related?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have a land-raised strain,
which is I guess the interest in that,
[SPEAKER_04]: are land-raised strains better for what
you can pull out of them than turn into?
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that lead you in the direction
for?
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't say that necessarily.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say that they have unique synthase
pathways that maybe modern varieties
[SPEAKER_09]: don't, so there's a lot to learn from
them.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would say that the interest of
land-raised is more on mobility and
[SPEAKER_09]: post-anything else.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Production-wise, land-raised strains are
not going to be very useful.
[SPEAKER_09]: They could take very long to flower,
they may produce very low cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_09]: content.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say, again, it's more about mobility
and maybe the baseline for breeding
[SPEAKER_09]: programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this is what I just heard,
actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was a Thai company or... It was
basically an Asian company.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was either Australia or New
Zealand or from that part of the world,
[SPEAKER_05]: who actually had started to engage in
trying to find new land-race across Asia
[SPEAKER_05]: and Latin America in particular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would a company do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because they want to breed,
they're in the medical side of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would somebody do that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, those unique synthase pathways that
don't exist in modern varieties.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Cofilots, my company, we essentially
started as a product of the American
[SPEAKER_09]: Museum of Natural History in New York.
[SPEAKER_09]: We sequenced about a thousand land-race
varieties from over 80 different
[SPEAKER_09]: countries.
[SPEAKER_09]: But most of those were from university or
barriers, so they existed pre-prohibition,
[SPEAKER_09]: so they were from the late 80s.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what you guys are doing is basically
creating documentation and testing for the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis formulations of tomorrow,
whether that's your plant or whether
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the liquid in your jar or the stuff
in your medical device or the stuff in
[SPEAKER_05]: your soda or beer, basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are the formulations,
the foundations of that industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so to answer your previous question
of what I think of the biotech industry is
[SPEAKER_07]: what people, there's a big misconception
in this industry that when a jurisdiction
[SPEAKER_07]: is legal and you have a plant that's
natural, it equals to a safe and effective
[SPEAKER_07]: product, and that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for me... Can you give an example?
[SPEAKER_07]: So for an example, it could be that you
can have an oil tincture sitting on a
[SPEAKER_07]: shelf right now for a medical patient and
you don't know if there is stability
[SPEAKER_07]: testing on that product.
[SPEAKER_07]: So meaning that that product is actually
stable for the past few months if the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoid content is still there,
if it's not degradated, or even if it
[SPEAKER_07]: could be toxic.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not real testing really done in
the industry and that's something that
[SPEAKER_07]: we're trying to bridge the gap,
and that's why the medical community has
[SPEAKER_07]: been so distant or not open-minded to
prescribing medical cannabis for patients
[SPEAKER_07]: and bringing that education to play
requires data and rigorous testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to do formulation work,
you need to do QC work, QA work,
[SPEAKER_07]: you need to do analytical tests,
pre-clinical tests, individual testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the type of stuff that at a basic
level we need to bridge that gap between
[SPEAKER_07]: the medical community from a physician
perspective as well as the patient
[SPEAKER_09]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say if cannabis innovation is a Maslow
hierarchy of needs, then breeding is the
[SPEAKER_09]: baseline of that pyramid and then
formulation would go off from there
[SPEAKER_08]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: The testing, and that's what you're
getting at, is the testing really then
[SPEAKER_08]: proves the efficacy of those cameras that
you're saying we're reading for and we're
[SPEAKER_08]: reading for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then testing in the labs, which is so
important because really what we're trying
[SPEAKER_08]: to do in the end, at least for us being
entirely medical focused, is making sure
[SPEAKER_08]: that what we produce and put on the market
has a formulation or a flower even in
[SPEAKER_08]: certain markets where we can't say it's
doing a formulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's important to make sure that the
patient is getting the outcome that
[SPEAKER_08]: they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And really that goes down to the camera
profile of the flower or the profile of
[SPEAKER_08]: the formulation and of course the
stability of that formulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of this is very fascinating,
but the next question is how would you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys say this ties into things like GMP?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now for those of you who don't know what
GMP is, it's a standard here in Europe
[SPEAKER_05]: that applies to its good manufacturing
practice and it's like a seed to sale
[SPEAKER_05]: quality test.
[SPEAKER_05]: How does what you guys do tie into that
discussion?
[SPEAKER_07]: It creates a standard, global standard
that when you're following certain types
[SPEAKER_07]: of protocols and practices and as a
cultivator in Colombia, there is a stigma
[SPEAKER_07]: around the Colombian market.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you say you're, like for us,
we're GACP going to be GAP, so good
[SPEAKER_07]: agricultural practices.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to be producing these
products with these international
[SPEAKER_07]: standards and then manufacturing them with
GMP standards as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: It creates some sort of level of comfort
and a level of sophistication because you
[SPEAKER_07]: could say I'm a cultivator in Colombia and
well some people might think you're
[SPEAKER_07]: growing in the jungle and you know as like
an illegal market, but that's not the
[SPEAKER_07]: case, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of, it adds that prestigious
level and creates a high quality of the
[SPEAKER_07]: active pharmaceutical ingredient that we
treat the cannabinoids as.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I'm also trying to get some
reaction from the audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I have a hands up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who in the audience is actively engaged in
this kind of environment or this kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: activity in Europe?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anybody in the room?
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can get a microphone to you,
are you hearing things from the folks here
[SPEAKER_05]: from non-European sources?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know you're global as well,
but what I'm curious about is how this
[SPEAKER_05]: discussion has differed so far from the
conversation in Europe on these,
[SPEAKER_05]: because do you have any insight on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do, we'll do, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hard to give an estimate over here
since there's very very few companies who
[SPEAKER_06]: do so or specialize in this kind of R&D
activities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't take this for granted, maybe I just
don't know about all the companies that
[SPEAKER_06]: are active in this field.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, what we're focusing on is fairly
similar to what you guys do, so I think
[SPEAKER_06]: it's in a way on par, on par.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you think, I'm gonna bounce this
back, so because my spectrum sitting here,
[SPEAKER_05]: this seems to be the groundwork of the
next, certainly the medical discussion,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if a doctor knows that they're
prescribing this brand that is proven to
[SPEAKER_05]: be stable and you've gone through the
tests and it's treated like a
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmaceutical, that's a great discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then there's the flip side,
and those of us in the room who are older
[SPEAKER_05]: than probably 35, remember this horrible
fear that sort of came out of the old
[SPEAKER_05]: timey or industry of like, oh my god,
my strain is gonna be bought up by
[SPEAKER_05]: Monsanto to name one company, and they're
gonna rule the world, and then cannabis is
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna go into another strain-controlled
world, and how scary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll, so when you're talking about
types of specific indications that people
[SPEAKER_07]: are suffering from and you know they're
already using different types of
[SPEAKER_07]: pharmaceutical products, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So in our field, we take it very seriously
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there has to be a level of
sophistication.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't wanna give someone an oil
tincture that you say, oh, this oil
[SPEAKER_07]: tincture works for epilepsy and they have
a bad reaction.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is why you treat it at this
serious level.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a social responsibility for everyone
who's in this space.
[SPEAKER_07]: As much as people think it's a new economy
that's being built and it's a very
[SPEAKER_07]: interesting, fast-growing industry,
but you still need to have that
[SPEAKER_07]: responsibility that if you are gonna put
products out there, that they should be
[SPEAKER_07]: properly tested.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree entirely.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the global reputation is on all of
our shoulders right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's my question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is it being really regulated?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, certainly in Europe, if you're a
medical product, if you're a
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmaceutical product, there are testing
and other things that go along with it
[SPEAKER_05]: that are mainstreamed into this
discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this regulation discussion saying that
on the biotech front, certainly in the
[SPEAKER_05]: American hemisphere, what you guys are
doing is ahead of the regulation?
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, being in this industry for about
three and a half years, the European
[SPEAKER_07]: market feels like Canada three and a half
years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: The good thing about being in Canada as
well and being based in Canada is from
[SPEAKER_07]: being the first G7 company to a country to
legalize marijuana for not just medicinal,
[SPEAKER_07]: but recreational, the one good thing is
that we could do R&D at a federal level
[SPEAKER_07]: and we can do clinical trials at a federal
level.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are health Canada approved
testing that has a level of sophistication
[SPEAKER_07]: globally.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the US, unfortunately, cannabis is not
considered, it's considered a controlled
[SPEAKER_07]: drug.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's illegal from a federal level,
which limits the Americans to do any R&D
[SPEAKER_07]: and clinical development.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they can't necessarily generate real
actual data and market that data or use
[SPEAKER_07]: that data in their production or on R&D.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in Germany, what I've noticed is now is
like, because it's such a young industry
[SPEAKER_07]: here or in Europe, I should say,
then it's still growing and it's in the
[SPEAKER_07]: early stages, there's a lot of room for
growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to add that level of sophistication
just makes it that much better for medical
[SPEAKER_07]: practitioners in Europe to bridge that gap
and be more comfortable prescribing
[SPEAKER_07]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to push this one again and
come back to you now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where is this in another example of the
industry being ahead of the regulatory
[SPEAKER_05]: environment?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or when you call cannabis, say a medical
product, does it slot into the testing
[SPEAKER_05]: environment?
[SPEAKER_05]: Even in the United States, even before
federal reform, because there's something
[SPEAKER_05]: called the FDA, this is a narcotic,
it will probably be a schedule two.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, all those things are coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go back quickly to the
intellectual property in the GMP factors,
[SPEAKER_08]: because I think that GMP, first off,
good manufacturing practices for the
[SPEAKER_08]: European Union, which is essentially,
at least right now in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: industry, the highest level.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's similar to what you might do in a
pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, I believe, important because if
you focus on that and you're manufacturing
[SPEAKER_08]: to that level, you're going to always get
a consistent product for the patient,
[SPEAKER_08]: which means you're going to, of course,
be able to provide things like the
[SPEAKER_08]: stability data and other things that I
personally believe is important if you're
[SPEAKER_08]: selling a medical product.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do that with flour even,
but it just takes time, basically,
[SPEAKER_08]: proving that stability.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's important if you have the right
flour, then you can still potentially make
[SPEAKER_08]: that the right medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, intellectual property, a whole
complex ball, I should say, basically,
[SPEAKER_08]: because it's kind of difficult to register
certain things like cultivars.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, in the US, it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's a cultivar?
[SPEAKER_08]: A cultivar is a strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the proper way to say it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the scientific term would be cultivar.
[SPEAKER_08]: The black market called it a strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: But actually, if you talk to any of my
breeders, they'd say cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just anybody over 35.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a strain.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a strain.
[SPEAKER_09]: Strain refers more to bacteria.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Strain is actually a plant virus.
[SPEAKER_08]: So cultivar is a little bit more... If I
can get everyone here saying cultivar,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Variety works, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could say variety.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that works.
[SPEAKER_08]: So intellectual property is something
that's very hard to register when it comes
[SPEAKER_08]: to plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Monsanto model is a bit of an odd
model, but they did pretty good at it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you look at some other companies
that are doing similar things,
[SPEAKER_08]: what they do is, effectively, they
register plant breeder's rights,
[SPEAKER_08]: which takes a plant breeder's permit,
which takes someone who has at least 15 or
[SPEAKER_08]: so years of experience in plant breeding,
which is rare.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you can combine these two things and
essentially find someone who can do that,
[SPEAKER_08]: then register those strains, and then
manufacture that at a GMP level,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's essentially the future of
cultivation, at least in my books.
[SPEAKER_08]: When it comes to formulation, there's a
whole other aspect of intellectual
[SPEAKER_08]: property, and, of course, the efficacy of
all those different formulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I interrupt?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a wealth of information,
so I'm going to jump in with one of those
[SPEAKER_05]: stupid questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why would I go ahead and register my
strain, excuse me, my cultivar,
[SPEAKER_05]: if I'm going to go ahead and just have a
processed something, which obviously has
[SPEAKER_05]: to be tested and whatever, but if I'm just
going to be making liquids or something
[SPEAKER_05]: from that and mixing and matching or
whatever, certainly if I'm out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: medical space, I understand to a certain
extent why this is important, but again,
[SPEAKER_05]: to my question, where are the people
telling you guys what to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are the regulations, or are you guys
doing this as you're going along,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is not necessarily a bad thing,
but where is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Get a good lawyer.
[SPEAKER_08]: But really, it's very hard to actually
register some of these things.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually more like a process patent.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not so much of protecting the
formulation itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, there's the
trademarks and the brand associated to
[SPEAKER_08]: that particular product.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably the key takeaway from
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's your IP, really, not so much that
you've just combined CBD and some
[SPEAKER_08]: particular flavonoid or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really about the process of how
you derive that, then how did you put it
[SPEAKER_08]: together, and then if you can protect that
in some way, that's a way to secure some
[SPEAKER_08]: IP.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even in the US, it's a way to secure
IP in a place where it's not completely
[SPEAKER_08]: federally legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Europe, you can do it as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just only in certain places right
now, because THC, you can't work with in
[SPEAKER_08]: certain countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so I'm going to do a quick hands up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to keep you active.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, hands up in the audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is kind of like bugged?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, not like a professional,
you know, whatever, but just on a visceral
[SPEAKER_05]: level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is bugged?
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to time out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm crazy bugged by this whole
conversation, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hands up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is bugged by this conversation?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hands up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is people just sleeping?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who is profoundly worried right now about
the fact that private companies,
[SPEAKER_05]: no offense, because these guys are really
smart, private companies are creating IP.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is intellectual property that is
protected in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hands up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're a couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you why.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the old hippie in me.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, cannabis has been
decentralized for a very long time,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hundreds of thousands of growers all
over the world, all creating their own
[SPEAKER_03]: little strains, all doing their own little
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we move toward these giant
corporations and capitalism loves to
[SPEAKER_03]: capitalize, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wants to own the whole market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wants to be a monopoly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wants to, oh, well, we own train
wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we invented O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: These sort of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got Girl Scout cookies, though,
baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever it is, these sort of things
sometimes seem to me to be the opposite of
[SPEAKER_03]: how cannabis culture has evolved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand that the world changes
and I understand that business is
[SPEAKER_03]: business.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how do you patent a plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going to stop people from saying,
like I say, you have to grow these seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to buy these seeds from us all
the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Surprisingly, I'm actually very
anti-capitalist.
[SPEAKER_09]: But to make the hippie very happy,
we actually think we've collected about
[SPEAKER_09]: now 3000 or sequenced the DNA of about
3000 plants from 84 countries to date.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that most of that data has been
uploaded to the Open Canvas Project and
[SPEAKER_09]: the NCBI.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are currently fighting utility
patents and creating data space to fight
[SPEAKER_09]: future utility patents.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's a utility patent?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you just explain?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a broad scoping patent on a
particular plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got the strain and you can't use it
and I can sue your butt.
[SPEAKER_09]: But varieties like O.G.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kush, train wreck, things that were on the
market today can never be patented and
[SPEAKER_09]: they never will be, nor should they be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I make it quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a landmark U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patent Office ruling, I think it's a 2013
ruling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Myriad versus someone else that
basically says that anything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: natural, anything, any plant or anything,
any DNA, any genetics that existed
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally cannot be patented.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have modified the genetics in
the lab, you can patent that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything that existed up until now
naturally cannot be patented.
[SPEAKER_01]: The process to extract, to do whatever you
want to do can be patented.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the genetics itself cannot be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody in the world pretty much
uses that ruling, which was a big Supreme
[SPEAKER_01]: Court case in 2013.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question then is, so what you guys
are doing while important and cool and
[SPEAKER_05]: like the land race discussion is awesome,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is what you're doing really for the
pharmaceutical market?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can certainly see an
application.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is this really for the recreation folks
who are like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my gin.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my cigarette.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my da da da.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, where do you really see this being
applied?
[SPEAKER_05]: The commercial recreational space or
medical?
[SPEAKER_05]: And be honest.
[SPEAKER_09]: Specifically for Phylos, it's both medical
and recreational.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we're in multiple markets today
from Canada, Colombia, Spain, all of the
[SPEAKER_09]: United States.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say it's both in that sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pharmaceutical will definitely be a larger
market in the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's where breeding for novel
cannabinoids will come into play.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'd say recreation is still a big part
of it as well, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I have to agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I look at what happened in Canada
with legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the recreational is in the future
probably going to be a big part of the
[SPEAKER_08]: market.
[SPEAKER_08]: Atlas is focused on medical.
[SPEAKER_08]: So because we focus on the formulations
and the efficacy of those formulations,
[SPEAKER_08]: that's really where we focus our efforts.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do see a huge opportunity in the
recreational markets.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a company like yours is going
to do very well with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm going to throw another one in
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so those of you who are in Europe know
about this whole novel foods discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you guys are registering all these
strains, for those of you who don't know
[SPEAKER_05]: what novel foods is, the European Union
has regulations that say that any
[SPEAKER_05]: plant-based material, and if you know a
better definition, please criticize me
[SPEAKER_05]: later.
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, the European Union says
that any plant-based material that makes
[SPEAKER_05]: its way into human food that was not in
common use before, I believe 1997,
[SPEAKER_05]: has to go through a special regulation
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, CBD in particular in food
right now is falling into that discussion
[SPEAKER_05]: across Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how is what you guys are doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe if you don't know, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: How is what you guys are going to help or
aid or hold back or hinder that novel food
[SPEAKER_05]: discussion here in the EU?
[SPEAKER_08]: I can definitely speak to that because I
think that for us being able to infuse our
[SPEAKER_08]: isolated compounds, proven compounds that
we know are consistent and dosed properly
[SPEAKER_08]: is a huge part of what would make people
comfortable having an infused product of
[SPEAKER_08]: any sort, be it a beverage or an edible
product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that for Europe having this
big debate right now with regards to CBD
[SPEAKER_08]: and how it should be produced and how it
should be distributed, I think it's
[SPEAKER_08]: important that being something that many
people consider medical, and I personally
[SPEAKER_08]: consider medical, it's important that it
goes through the right processing,
[SPEAKER_08]: the checks and balances to make sure that
what you purchase is actually what you
get.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess that's an issue I've seen in a
lot of places, including in some parts of
[SPEAKER_08]: the US where there's less regulatory
environment and you get a product.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, we tested 30 products,
CBD products or claimed to be CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: And out of 30, there was actually just a
fraction that even contains CBD and only
[SPEAKER_08]: three that actually had the amount that
they said they did.
[SPEAKER_08]: So to me, that regulatory environment
that's going to oversee what's going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: an infused product is important.
[SPEAKER_08]: And how it was produced and is it clean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it real?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's also important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so any questions from the audience?
[SPEAKER_05]: Any thoughts?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, there's one over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new strains you develop, they can
cross in nature with the original hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can see it in the corn industry or
corn farming that the natural strains no
[SPEAKER_02]: more exist in the world because the
artificial strains crossed in the fields
[SPEAKER_02]: with the natural strains and so the
natural strains they have been here maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 years ago, you can never find in the
planet anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm afraid that this danger will
expand worldwide with the hemp too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the old wise plant, our hemp,
will disappear from planet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think preserving seed diversity,
particularly in cannabis, same thing,
[SPEAKER_09]: is very important.
[SPEAKER_09]: During the 20th century, we saw a massive
decline in the diversity of seeds
[SPEAKER_09]: available, which is what you're speaking
about.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think only maybe 10% of the original
varieties that existed 100 years ago are
[SPEAKER_09]: still available today.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's only one kind of banana damn near
the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to run out of those in 20
years.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have to avoid monoculture.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think part of what Phyllis has done,
at least, working with the American Museum
[SPEAKER_09]: of Natural History on a project called the
Cannabis Evolution Project, is about
[SPEAKER_09]: identifying and then preserving the seed
diversity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's actually where small growers
around the world will come in and they
[SPEAKER_09]: will be the powerhouses that preserve this
diversity of cannabis we see today,
[SPEAKER_09]: which absolutely needs to exist.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as we move ever forward, we have to
remember where we came from always.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I couldn't agree more, honestly,
about preserving those strains and making
[SPEAKER_08]: sure that, first off, the breeders,
the Jedi's of the industry, that have been
[SPEAKER_08]: around forever, they've really been the
ones who have defined the industry today.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's important that they're
recognized.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where these strains and strain
names and other things, cannabis and hemp,
[SPEAKER_08]: really, it's important to recognize who
originally brought these to the market,
[SPEAKER_08]: who's been producing these.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we don't forget that, because we don't
want to wind up in a situation where
[SPEAKER_08]: everything goes away, like bananas,
for instance, which you're right,
[SPEAKER_08]: they are going to go away at some point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was my question about the
regulatory environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think it is lagging.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are issues, obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the next question.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early this year, a team from Berkeley have
used synthetic biology to produce purified
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and CBD using yeast as a vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering how you, as traditional
breeder, are considering this successful
[SPEAKER_00]: new advance, which will be one of many
others in the next year?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think we all saw Rafael
Moschulam's talk yesterday.
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I hope we did.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's impossible to get those
yeast, genetically engineered yeast
[SPEAKER_09]: varieties, to produce the same level of
compounds that cannabis can today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk to the research kings in Dortmund,
Germany, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would disagree with you about that
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they were talking about,
I mean, just producing THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is the whole entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the CBD, the CBG, the CBN,
the mercy, and the blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_03]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_09]: The cost to produce those isolates from
yeast is extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's absurd to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You might as well just grow a weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow a weed plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: The boss says no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, as always, you can all
huddle in the hallway and have heated
[SPEAKER_03]: debate and discussion and coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: We thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it for Benjamin and Sheldon and
Arash and Marguerite.
Thank you.
