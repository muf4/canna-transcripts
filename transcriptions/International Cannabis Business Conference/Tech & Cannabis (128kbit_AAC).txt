[SPEAKER_03]: Here to talk tech and cannabis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The CTO of Bud.com, Justin Hall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, and Gaio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a great responsibility.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to rock your mind for about a
half an hour and take you into 420.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have an additional panelist too,
and I'll ask him to kick us off because
[SPEAKER_05]: it's his first time being on a panel.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Lee Hilpert.
[SPEAKER_09]: Close your mouth.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Lee Hilpert.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm with Organics.
[SPEAKER_09]: Organics is a manufacturer of oil and
distillates located in Hollister,
[SPEAKER_09]: California.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our facility is fully automated,
and we utilize that automation and new
[SPEAKER_09]: technologies to try to increase the
quality of the products that we make for
[SPEAKER_09]: our customers.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're certain that automation and new
technology will be critical to this
[SPEAKER_09]: industry as it starts to scale.
[SPEAKER_09]: And meet the future demands of this
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: What background possibly qualified you to
build what you're building?
[SPEAKER_09]: I started out my career in the food
processing industry, doing centrifuging
[SPEAKER_09]: and liquid-solid separation, distillation,
and preservatives.
[SPEAKER_09]: I moved over into the oil field when the
oil field needed some liquid-solid
[SPEAKER_09]: separation and worked over there for many
years in distillation, solid separations.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when I looked into the cannabis
industry, I saw that there was a real need
[SPEAKER_09]: for this kind of technology, and we
thought that there was a great opportunity
[SPEAKER_09]: to come help.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you Google this guy, about the only
thing that comes up is 40 patents.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Vince Ning.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the founder of Nabist Distribution.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we pride ourselves on being a
tech-driven distributor and trying to make
[SPEAKER_08]: as much as possible as a self-service
distributor.
[SPEAKER_08]: So at the end of the day, our core
competency is we focus on shipping
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis products for brands and helping
them get them into the retail market.
[SPEAKER_08]: What background led you to that?
[SPEAKER_08]: So most of my professional career has been
in the tech industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a technologist, we're always
looking for ways to help bring new
[SPEAKER_08]: software, new platforms, new ways to
automate industries where there's a high
[SPEAKER_08]: demand for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's how I got into the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And frankly, I just have a personal
passion for the product.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was pretty natural for me to put
those two together and get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, my name is Hua.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a company called Meadow,
CEO and head janitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a lot of things there,
primarily building software for retailers
[SPEAKER_00]: and delivery operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with over 100 in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife is also an edible maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pretty entrenched in the industry
and understand what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: What were you doing before Meadow that
prepared you to build that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's one way to get to the weed
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were sort of rapping beforehand
about how tech impacts us.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think Hua put his finger on the way
that tech will interfere with everybody's
[SPEAKER_05]: life in the marijuana business,
which is metric.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so just to sort of get that rolling
and get that kicked off, how many of you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know what I mean when I say metric?
[SPEAKER_05]: Raise your hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: For those two dudes in the sweater vests
in the back, one of you guys want to break
[SPEAKER_05]: it out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not Mr. Hardware.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm more happy to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So metric for California track and trace
is what we're going to be using to track
[SPEAKER_00]: every gram of cannabis that's harvested to
the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it passes along a lot of different
parts of the supply chain, from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator to the manufacturer to the
distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to also get lab tested,
ultimately to the retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through that tracking is an RFID tag
that's basically low jacked to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that, you have package IDs are
created from that harvest that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: turned into manufacturing products or
finished goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's brought into the retailer
side, you also then bring those package
[SPEAKER_00]: IDs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's what we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you guys, because of your position in
the industry, you have already done some
[SPEAKER_05]: metric work a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're practically integrated.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's one of those things that I
think everyone is, I guess, looking
[SPEAKER_08]: forward to doing is integrating with
metric.
[SPEAKER_08]: And currently, I would say the resources
out there aren't, you know, plenty enough
[SPEAKER_08]: to have everyone be on the same page as to
how to use this one API.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, a lot of people,
frankly, right now are using, are just
[SPEAKER_08]: emailing in their manifest for track and
trace.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the most common way that
people are abiding by these laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in addition, I think, you know,
the metric compliance is really enforced
[SPEAKER_08]: once you get your annual license.
[SPEAKER_08]: And currently, most people are still
operating under their temporary
[SPEAKER_08]: provisional licenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's something that everyone is,
it's top of mind right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's really important to discuss.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because, you know, in order to
continue operating compliantly moving
[SPEAKER_08]: forward, once everyone gets their annual
licenses, we all need to be on the same
[SPEAKER_08]: page about how to use this technology to,
you know, comply with state laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we aim to do is to talk very
briefly and then open it up for questions,
[SPEAKER_05]: by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you got a metric hot pants,
you get near Nagayo to get your question
[SPEAKER_05]: in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think one thing that I was pitching
to you guys is that for hardware,
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to tune, you built hardware to
separate solid and fluid for avocados and
[SPEAKER_05]: shale oil or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you had to recalibrate it for
cannabis, can you tell us something about
[SPEAKER_05]: what you had to do there?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so just taking our experience in the
other industries, the basic science of it
[SPEAKER_09]: is sound and goes across the industries.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the specifics about how to handle the
individual cannabis plants, how to
[SPEAKER_09]: automate that, how to move it from one
place to the other, how to integrate with
[SPEAKER_09]: Matrix, how to develop software within our
platform that will actually track all the
[SPEAKER_09]: lot numbers and everything seamlessly
because our goal is to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: a fully automated plant that really a guy
can set at a control panel and can operate
[SPEAKER_09]: and can produce these products.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's a lot of things to think
about, especially on the compliance side
[SPEAKER_09]: and things like that, and make sure that
the software and hardware can work
[SPEAKER_09]: together to ultimately meet that goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I was trying to, I was also
fishing for like an image of you going
[SPEAKER_05]: from like, oil dripping off your hands to
like handling soft buds or like the
[SPEAKER_05]: transformation in your, sort of the
materials you were handling.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have stories about that or something?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_09]: Working in the oil field, it's a
challenging career for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving around from platform to platform
and looking at those things and there was
[SPEAKER_09]: just an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were up in Canada doing some BOP
testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was snowing, it was colder than you can
believe and things were freezing up and
[SPEAKER_09]: anyway, we were riding along and it was
just at that moment that we decided,
[SPEAKER_09]: man, this is not really what we want to be
doing and we had been looking into the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis industry and really wanted to
make that change and so we moved out and
[SPEAKER_09]: did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for the guys on the software end of
things, we were talking a bit about
[SPEAKER_05]: whether, you know, so I'm the chief
technology officer of Bud.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: I qualified for this business by smoking
weed and also loving the internet and
[SPEAKER_05]: registering Bud.com 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I started coming to this conference four
years ago and networking until I met
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody who could help me make a real
thing out of the thing and now we deliver
[SPEAKER_05]: pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you like marijuana, we'll bring it
to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Homes or hotels, Bud.com, fired up
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, you know, when we went to
build our platform, we could not use
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial software packages that regular
internet startups could use.
[SPEAKER_05]: We couldn't use payment methods,
we couldn't use e-commerce shops,
[SPEAKER_05]: we couldn't use CRM packages, we couldn't
use billing packages.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, advertising packages, it was like
the startup specialization of a startup's
[SPEAKER_05]: experimental extreme course.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't even believe it because I'd
been in software for 20 years but it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like, how about if you just take all the
building blocks you have that you use to
[SPEAKER_05]: make a company and you remove them all so
you have to start from scratch and do all
[SPEAKER_05]: your own stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really makes an honest sort of,
you know, producer out of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: All that is to say that I thought maybe in
a few years cannabis will be legal,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and President Ivanka Trump will
legalize it and we'll all be allowed to
[SPEAKER_05]: use whatever software we want and the
people making specialized cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: software will kind of disappear because
we'll all just be inhaled into some giant
[SPEAKER_05]: ERP.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you guys were disagreeing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would say, you know, it's a common
question that we get asked actually is,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, why can't you just take an off
the shelf ERP system and start using it
[SPEAKER_08]: for yourself and I think one of the
main... Enterprise resource planning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, a lot of three letter acronyms in
the tech world.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, essentially, I think the
main reason is because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: compliance and regulatory reasons.
[SPEAKER_08]: For instance, for us, like, we have to
bake into our system automating how to
[SPEAKER_08]: generate manifests, you know, testing and
all that sort of stuff, tracking and,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, again, abiding by metric
compliance standards.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so those are all things that your
typical off the shelf, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: ERP system doesn't come with.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we had to build a lot of that in
house and I think a lot of the other
[SPEAKER_08]: operators in the industry, like who over
here with Meadow, is doing himself too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure, you know, it sounds like you
ran into the same issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the next step for all the kind
of software operators in this industry is
[SPEAKER_08]: really to, you know, put all the pieces
together in a way that we're currently,
[SPEAKER_08]: at least we have software for the industry
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: The next step is really to make those
identifiers for the packages for all the
[SPEAKER_08]: products unified.
[SPEAKER_08]: To have like a universal system from seed
to sale, you know, all the tracking
[SPEAKER_08]: because otherwise when you pass products
from one license entity to another,
[SPEAKER_08]: you get a lot of mismatch of data and the
data integrity becomes poor.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's the next step for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a lot of people home
growing their own software and it's really
[SPEAKER_08]: great for the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's just V1.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think V2 is really getting everyone to
be on the same page about how we interact
[SPEAKER_08]: with each other's systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you said everything was great
there, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the only thing I would add to that
is, you know, we talk about a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: change that's happened in the last year
and last couple decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think traditional
companies can move as quickly to adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: with what's going on and they don't really
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do they care about the excise
tax?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care a lot about the excise tax,
you know, as much as everyone here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they care about integrating lab tests
to understand the potency levels for the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer because that makes them a more
educated buyer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still too small for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you think about,
you know, will we be commoditized into
[SPEAKER_00]: this other realm in 10 years?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are going to be some best in
class companies that come out of this that
[SPEAKER_00]: will be as big as some of the other
operators there because just like alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: or tobacco or pharmaceuticals or food or,
you know, organic food and subsectors,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis will have its own, you know,
thing because of the laws and the nuances
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just at a local and a state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do state to state,
you know, eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing global.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at just shipping across
different countries and the tariffs and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff, that has to be built in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do you know what the regs are
going to be in Columbia when we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be shipping and exporting and importing
from them?
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has to get worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think because of that, the people
that are on the ground here that are with
[SPEAKER_00]: us here today, I mean, we're all going to
be able to collaborate and work together
[SPEAKER_00]: and move this thing way farther than
anybody coming in from the outside that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just trying to gobble it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I asked the moderator of the last
panel, Lauren Frazier, hey, what could
[SPEAKER_05]: tech do for the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said, ah, there's a problem that
you guys could solve.
[SPEAKER_05]: Digitization.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are still using paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, oh my God, paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, get in the guile.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're ready for questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to use paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we have to use paper in some places,
but I think some people are using paper
[SPEAKER_05]: when they could be using like spreadsheets
or computers or email or, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: chat or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's part of the part of the
challenge while everyone's on a temporary
[SPEAKER_00]: license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to move into
provisionals and provisionals will have
[SPEAKER_00]: the metric mandate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think for there is going to be
a crossing to the digital side,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's still going to be a little bit
painful, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully we can use less trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have painkillers to go with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ready for questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're ready for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I'd like to say that you
have to use papers or how else would you
[SPEAKER_03]: roll a joint?
[SPEAKER_01]: With your digits digitally.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Introduce yourself and say what your
situation is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hold the mic closer to your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Mitchell Colbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Mitchell Colbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a lobbyist currently working on the
cannabis e-waste issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, while it is tech related,
is not related to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about the issues of having
to build everything yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I'm sure everyone in this room knows,
MJ Freeway has been hacked many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: MJ Freeway is one of the big POS systems
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there's security risks
present in forcing every business to
[SPEAKER_01]: reinvent the wheel, potentially leaving
back doors and security flaws in there
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than using tested and true
technology used in other industries?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to think that the technology we
use is at least as good as the technology
[SPEAKER_05]: used by the political parties of our
country and the banks and the major
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're not banging with Wells
Fargo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you look at modern technology
companies today, they're not building
[SPEAKER_00]: colocation servers by themselves and
putting resources there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using AWS or Heroku.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already have enterprise grade
solutions and encryption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you don't implement those
solutions, then you're also at a risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: exposing yourself to hacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So best in class should be utilizing third
party in a way that has those protections
[SPEAKER_00]: in place.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think as far as security goes,
I think this just goes for software in
[SPEAKER_08]: general, is that it's something that
improves over time as you maintain it
[SPEAKER_08]: more.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't imagine Microsoft started with
their old first computer with the best
[SPEAKER_08]: security primitives out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's something that as they reach more
and more issues, they did a lot of patches
[SPEAKER_08]: and it is where it is today.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's something that for us,
I think with the V1 level software that we
[SPEAKER_08]: have currently in the industry,
I'm sure there are a lot of security
[SPEAKER_08]: issues going on that people can lose their
data over.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think over time, it's something that
we'll have more bandwidth, frankly,
[SPEAKER_08]: to pay attention to and in addition,
more capital, more resources to apply.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it'll fix itself over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I first attended this conference,
I was a lonely nerd wanderer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was sort of walking around being like,
I got this web domain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like computers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You like weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then it's like, I just can't realize,
oh, I have an offering.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could try and make the weed world more
nerdy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when I think about security holes
in the weed business, it's going into a
[SPEAKER_05]: potential dispensary partner and seeing
the Gmail address for the entire
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary operation and the password
written on a post-it that's posted up
[SPEAKER_05]: above the computer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You talk about you need enterprise-grade
security in your AWS cloud server.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you also need the people on your
premises to have some basic digital
[SPEAKER_05]: literacy, maybe even splurge on a password
manager.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a lot of ways in which the
weed industry could use some
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer-grade tech tools to really make
money.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to say that the culture of
security pertains to the technical world,
[SPEAKER_03]: too, and not just when talking about weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And human factors, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if somebody leaves your enterprise
and you've got one password across your 16
[SPEAKER_05]: accounts, you lost your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did somebody just lose $200 million
because the guy who ran off with the money
[SPEAKER_03]: died and he has the only password?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's great adventure out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's digital literacy that I think
there's a lot of times when I go into
[SPEAKER_05]: business, I'm trying to help them
understand how bud.com could deliver for
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I really want to do is give them
a two-hour IT consultation to be like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you should try Google Docs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be amazing what collaborative
spreadsheets could do for your work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have a question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Stand up and introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Jordan.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're starting out in the Utah market.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's also partially where my question
lies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is starting out from really the ground up,
what's the best way to stay cost effective
[SPEAKER_07]: in our tracking?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, as far as compliance goes,
Utah's not going to be any different than
[SPEAKER_07]: Arkansas and all those other places that
have really heavily regulated religious
[SPEAKER_07]: markets and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thinking RFID tracking to blockchain,
is that where we're ending up?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we getting to that point?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took 18 minutes before somebody said
blockchain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was thinking we were going to be more
supply chain than blockchain.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think blockchain is this idea you
create a ledger that everybody can see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Including the feds?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the feds is us, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are the government.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that the dream?
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, you inscribe the
characteristics of the cannabis in this
[SPEAKER_05]: ledger that everybody can see.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's sort of track and traceable in
perpetuity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, you got a lot of work to do in Utah
before you try and make blockchain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody got something to say on this
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think with all startups,
it's not necessarily the tools,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how you guys communicate and
work together to keep costs low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when we were bootstrapping Meadow,
we lived in our apartments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to each other's apartments for
office.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cooked just rice and meat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was our dinner together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bring costs down.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it talked software, we had one user
that we all shared, so we didn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay extra user seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's ways around where you can
cut costs, but still invest in best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices to make things more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, in those areas, I think when you
have more resources, oftentimes you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: as creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having less resources, you tend to be a
little bit more conscious with every
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar that you have and then every minute
that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think ultimately, though, you need to
build something that people want,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is sort of a YC mantra.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go and talk to the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's YC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Y Combinator.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y Combinator.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, you landed from Planet Software.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Planet Cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So they don't know what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y Combinator is an incubator fund
accelerator community of entrepreneurs who
[SPEAKER_00]: have started a lot of some of the biggest
companies that you know in tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dropbox, Airbnb, Weebly, Coinbase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the list goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's really great about it is they
have a set of mantras that you should
[SPEAKER_00]: follow, and one of them is make something
that people want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of times, everyone's still
stuck in their apartment or at a coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: shop saying, I'm doing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who they should really be or what they
should really be spending time is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's your partner, go and talk to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work on closing out stuff at the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working with a brand or
manufacturer and you're doing marketing,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to their shop and talk to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that have fancy equipment
on the photography side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have a zoom lens,
just take your phone and go all the way up
[SPEAKER_00]: front to the person, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stuff like that where that type of
mantra is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you're building your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utah is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask Lee, do you have any advice for
people who have a hardware idea on how
[SPEAKER_05]: they can experiment and innovate?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what I would say is that if you are
starting up a business, just like they
[SPEAKER_09]: said, you should identify the product that
you ultimately want to produce as a
[SPEAKER_09]: product, obviously, that somebody wants to
buy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you also ought to do your
homework to make sure that the equipment
[SPEAKER_09]: that you are purchasing is the equipment
that will produce that end result for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that you don't have to go and read by
equipment and start all over when you
[SPEAKER_09]: haven't gotten it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: See, there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got one right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey there.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name's Eric.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm built.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right up on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Eric.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm building a data company for genetics
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm curious on what the industry's
perception is for data privacy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're basically building like a data
warehouse for all the different types of
[SPEAKER_06]: 23 and me, but for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where I upload my DNA and it tells me what
I should vape?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could clarify more to you later if you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think data is still an early topic
on how it's being talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think for your business,
you should talk with labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're seeing a lot of the
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing all the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you can do a partnership there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Steep Hill has a big one,
a big repository of DNA that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: sequenced, apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Philos is another group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there are resources there
where instead of like tap, you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: tap into it if they're open to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, are you talking about data privacy
like, this is my private strain?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that sounds like the intellectual
property.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an intellectual property thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's definitely a thing that's going
to be in the future, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's going to try to patent train
wreck or claim they were the first person
[SPEAKER_03]: to invent Bubba Kush or Acapulco Gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be Nagayo wreck and then you can
train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nagayo wreck, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to slip and fall in the grow
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The three people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Call Saul.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Peter, here to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think the biggest threats are
to your software business?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it competitors coming in from other
industries that, you know, might have a
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-established ERP or, you know,
CRM or POS system?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you see as some of the biggest
threats to your software businesses?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's make it inclusive, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we say hardware and hardware?
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say, I think you hit a couple of
those.
[SPEAKER_08]: One is, you know, if someone else were to
go build the same thing with more money
[SPEAKER_08]: and more resources, you know, that's
obviously a threat.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other, I think, that is, probably more
top of mind, more top of mind is probably
[SPEAKER_08]: the changing rules and regulations that
happen pretty frequently.
[SPEAKER_08]: It causes us to, I mean, the reason why we
in-house our software is because,
[SPEAKER_08]: for just that reason, it'd be pretty tough
to rely on, like, a third party,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, software provider, software
contracting firm to build out what we
[SPEAKER_08]: need, just because our operations have to
morph every single time these new regs
[SPEAKER_08]: come out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, the partners that we work
with also are startups.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they change the way that they operate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we have to be able to be nimble and
adapt and, you know, having our own
[SPEAKER_08]: software really helps with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, yeah, I mean, I think as far as,
like, other players coming in and building
[SPEAKER_08]: the same thing, I don't think they'd be
able to do it unless they ran their own
[SPEAKER_08]: infrastructure and understood,
really, like, for us, distribution.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, yeah, those are the kinds of
things that we see as threats,
[SPEAKER_08]: but we're wary of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just a couple of points on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, another mantra out there is
don't worry about your competitors,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your nose to the grindstone and just
run your own race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, I find that some operators
keep looking left and right, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing something, and then they pivot to go
build something that's just, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: shittier than what they did anyway,
instead of just focusing on what they
[SPEAKER_00]: should have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes, like, self-sabotage is a
threat because of the lack of focus or
[SPEAKER_00]: just looking at other things that are
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with cannabis, regulations is
definitely a threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be actually an opportunity,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at products out there,
you're creating a moat, and regulations is
[SPEAKER_00]: a moat, this regulatory moat that you have
to navigate through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being participatory within that
regulatory process is a unique opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cement is still wet, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the laws, it's still wet,
but we still have the ability to advocate
[SPEAKER_00]: on the legislative side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, give our feedback to the
regulators to create better laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we did our first push to metric
yesterday with one of our licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: operators, and, you know, we were able to
help that by, you know, on the board of
[SPEAKER_00]: the CCIA, on the board of the CDA,
by talking about, you know, getting a hand
[SPEAKER_00]: with them and commenting and sharing the
feedback that they don't get to see in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to help move this process along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's incredibly important to
look at these threats not necessarily a
[SPEAKER_00]: threat, but as an opportunity to kind of,
you know, reframe your thinking and how
[SPEAKER_00]: you move forward to be the best version of
yourself and your company as you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you briefly, if all of HUA's
dreams come true, and the regulations,
[SPEAKER_05]: people listen and they legalize,
and it all happened, and weed's on sale in
[SPEAKER_05]: Walgreens by next week, that would be
tough for our business.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that'd be a very accelerated
timeline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the existential threats to your
business you want to share with us?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think the threats to the
manufacturing side are just that the rules
[SPEAKER_09]: and regulations will get out in front of
the technology to be able to produce those
[SPEAKER_09]: products that can comply with those rules
and regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so just being able to meet the real
stringent testing requirements and things
[SPEAKER_09]: like that when you're trying to run a
fully automated process can be difficult.
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully they'll kind of rein those in
a little bit, and we'll be able to go
[SPEAKER_09]: ahead and process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have any more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But don't leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's hear it for the panel,
first of all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: O-E-O-E-O.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
