[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so you think that you've gotten a
legalization and the people who hate
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis still hate cannabis and they
still work against cannabis and they still
[SPEAKER_06]: want to stop it even though you keep
having common sense and listen if common
[SPEAKER_06]: sense and science were Accepted by
politicians.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would all have fewer problems But what
do I know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we're gonna move on.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the International Cannabis
Business Conference Berlin 2024 I'd like
[SPEAKER_06]: to thank our title sponsor the Tolman
group for reminding You were doing a
[SPEAKER_06]: science and technology forum in Slovenia
September 13th and all kinds of other
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff now to discuss the cultivation of
medical cannabis in Germany We have an
[SPEAKER_06]: all-star panel and it is led by the
managing director of Black Onyx Capital
[SPEAKER_06]: LLC Put your hands together and welcome
Claudia Hello
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna make it pretty brief
introduction.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Claudia Della Mora Kind of part
of the family now of ICBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm an investment banker managing
director of Black Legend Capital a
[SPEAKER_05]: boutique investment bank based in Los
Angeles Cannabis is one of the industries
[SPEAKER_05]: that we've been focusing on for the past
almost 10 years every vertical and also
[SPEAKER_05]: Emerging markets such as Europe and other
countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this panel is very interesting because
it's actually Not about only cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you know where we're Representing
here every vertical of the industry from
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation to distribution to
manufacturing pharma So I'll make it quick
[SPEAKER_05]: quick Introduction first of all here Kai
my friend Kai.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's one of the best attorneys in the
country so he will be probably diving into
[SPEAKER_05]: the You know answers for the legal legal
questions And then we have Benedict the
[SPEAKER_05]: founder of cancer Tiva which is the unique
and only authorized distributor in Germany
[SPEAKER_05]: correct me if I'm wrong of Cannabis flower
kind of a medical cannabis Cultivated in
[SPEAKER_05]: the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we know there was a tender in in the
country and three companies won the tender
[SPEAKER_05]: and there are the cultivators licensed
cultivators Then I can tell Ray and Aurora
[SPEAKER_05]: and we have actually here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a feeling from them again so Benedict
as I said is from cancer Tiva a
[SPEAKER_05]: distributor and then we also have Thomas
from a 420 pharma manufacturer and
[SPEAKER_05]: Pharmaceutical company if you guys want to
introduce briefly yourself, maybe and what
[SPEAKER_07]: something else Yeah, yeah, I'm Kai
Friedrich Neyman.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm lawyer since 2002.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in the industry since 2017 2017 I
visited my first cannabis conference and
[SPEAKER_07]: since 2019 I'm only Consulting CBD
companies hemp companies medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: import companies and I'm the legal advisor
of the European industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_08]: Association Well, I'm Philip I mentioned
director of damage can have been in the
[SPEAKER_08]: pharmaceutical industry now for more than
10 years and two and a half years now with
[SPEAKER_08]: damage can it's a bit more than just
cultivation for the German state it has
[SPEAKER_08]: been and it will be in the future of
Obviously, but we are really covering the
[SPEAKER_04]: full supply chain from sea to sail to say
so Yeah, and I'm Benedict representing
[SPEAKER_04]: cancer Tiva We're enabling cannabis and
building the leading platform to offer the
[SPEAKER_04]: most desirable brands and products.
[SPEAKER_04]: We import package Distribute products
throughout Germany and also into other EU
[SPEAKER_04]: countries We are also covering most parts
of the value chain excluding the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation Yes, and my name is Thomas
shut on CEO from 420 pharma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in the industry since five years now
we founded the company 2019 and are one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the Biggest wholesaler here across Europe
then 2022 the company cura leaf stepped in
[SPEAKER_02]: as an investor in our company and we are
happy to Discover whatever is in front of
[SPEAKER_02]: us after legalization here in Germany and
happy to be on this panel here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you So, let me ask like a quick
quick clarification because I saw you were
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, kind of looking at me like okay,
so cancer Tiva Distributor now also,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know importer and also exporter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard that you're made a new partnership
for distribution to towards Czech Republic
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me ask a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I understand it correctly is how I
actually have been studying it for several
[SPEAKER_05]: years following your work cancer Tiva this
distributes the Medical flower produced by
[SPEAKER_05]: the three cultivation, you know companies
right authorized but at the same time then
[SPEAKER_05]: we can as he said is actually Covering the
entire supply chain up to delivery.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where's the mismatch there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's it's a great question and
it's also let's say a important question
[SPEAKER_04]: right now due to the new regulation
because what you've mentioned is totally
[SPEAKER_04]: correct of the last years we on behalf of
the B farm so the German authority
[SPEAKER_04]: Distributed the locally grown medical
cannabis into the pharmacies hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one vertical of our work in
addition to that we import Other products
[SPEAKER_04]: we have own brands and also have a
wholesale business line So that's a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit the cancer Tiva perspective and as of
this new change and I'm very sure that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're covering this topic today in our our
panel there will be a certain change
[SPEAKER_04]: because There will be not only Demekan,
but potentially further license producers
[SPEAKER_04]: in the future and Obviously with this new
framework this products are not required
[SPEAKER_04]: to be pumped through the cancer Tiva
system because it's not part of this
[SPEAKER_04]: tender of this cultivation tender and also
our Distribution agreement that we also
[SPEAKER_04]: want in a tender So we are really at the
point where cancer cancer Tiva is still
[SPEAKER_04]: the exclusive partner of the governmental
authority on the distribution of
[SPEAKER_04]: domestically grown medical cannabis,
but only to the extent of the existing
[SPEAKER_04]: Contract and the existing let's say old
volumes and now we have this change Right
[SPEAKER_04]: until 2026, correct So it started in 2021
the first deliveries and it's a five years
[SPEAKER_04]: or four years contract and the last
Product I think that was Aurora and also
[SPEAKER_04]: Demekan in 2022 was connected so 2026
should be correct given that there's no
[SPEAKER_04]: change on this overall framework and
contract because this is also something
[SPEAKER_04]: that needs to be elaborated and to be
worked on will there be a change on this
[SPEAKER_04]: contract that Maybe Demekan has with the
authorities and also we have with the
[SPEAKER_04]: authorities and that's probably nothing
that we can disclose or discuss publicly
[SPEAKER_05]: right now Let's talk about you know this
this new there's a couple of new
[SPEAKER_05]: situations here, right the legalization of
adult use and the liberalization of
[SPEAKER_05]: medical cannabis now the liberalization of
medical cannabis we're talking about the
[SPEAKER_05]: lifting of the restrictions of production
for each one of the three cultivators and
[SPEAKER_05]: at the same time also Potentially
unlimited licenses Someone says even up to
[SPEAKER_05]: a hundred.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about the pros and cons,
you know coming from the US We all are
[SPEAKER_05]: used to You know think limited license
market is better than unlimited license
[SPEAKER_05]: market so and plus at the same time,
there's also the Legalization of the adult
[SPEAKER_05]: use which obviously, you know,
it's not really how we're thinking about
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cannabis club social clubs and
Potentially if when there will be you know
[SPEAKER_05]: commercialization of adult use probably
the license authorizations to cultivate
[SPEAKER_05]: Adult use will be given to the medical
cannabis cultivators.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so pros and cons Yeah,
I mean, let me maybe we took we take a
[SPEAKER_07]: look back into history So if we remember
the first ICBC in 2017, there was the
[SPEAKER_07]: tender Everything the procedures were
starting and I remember 18 19 companies
[SPEAKER_07]: were preparing for the application for the
tender lots of consultants lawyers
[SPEAKER_07]: companies Coming here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like a green rush here by that time
in Berlin and Yeah, that was a big thing
[SPEAKER_07]: and everyone wanted to do that So there
were these restrictions to ten tons for
[SPEAKER_07]: four years and we were just talking about
that burn these restrictions in time by
[SPEAKER_07]: that place and we would have the same
situation like now without restriction and
[SPEAKER_07]: one would have Been able to apply for a
license if the pharmaceutical weights were
[SPEAKER_07]: fulfilled Imagine that we would have 10 15
20 30 facilities already here in Germany
[SPEAKER_07]: producing locally But that didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the restriction were in place and
probably for the market development that
[SPEAKER_07]: was the right decision for for that time
but then the federal elections came and
[SPEAKER_07]: the Liberal Party the FTP They were
demanding that these restrictions should
[SPEAKER_07]: be lifted and we lunch in work always said
Germany has to become the export nation
[SPEAKER_07]: the export world record Championship for
medical cannabis and everyone said oh,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's strange.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a brave brave calling and yeah now
it came no one really It was at the last
[SPEAKER_07]: moment in November.
[SPEAKER_07]: No one really expected that lifted that
these restrictions were lifted because it
[SPEAKER_07]: wasn't really in the debate, but they did
a good lobby work here these These guys so
[SPEAKER_07]: nobody We have the situation indeed.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no restriction whatsoever or not
on product quantity not on numbers of
[SPEAKER_07]: facilities Nothing when you can produce
cannabis to pharmaceutical standards.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can produce it in Germany you can
apply and you will Authorization will have
[SPEAKER_07]: to be granted to your to your company
exactly How many companies do you think
[SPEAKER_05]: they're gonna they're gonna start
applying?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the big question because we are not
in the same situation as 1718 companies
[SPEAKER_07]: and people were prepared their money was
there the North American companies they
[SPEAKER_07]: were ready for expansion going global
going Europe And this attitude is not
[SPEAKER_07]: there anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were several crises as the cannabis
market in the US still in the crisis,
[SPEAKER_07]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think so the funders of You know
this new cultivation facility will come
[SPEAKER_05]: from North America or not like,
you know, Europe Hard to tell hard to tell
[SPEAKER_07]: because you have to keep one thing in mind
There's this article 21 of the single
[SPEAKER_07]: convention saying basically and in Canada
applies that they're saying basically the
[SPEAKER_07]: more you produce domestically the less you
can import So in the mid to long run in
[SPEAKER_07]: the next two three to five years If the
American or over till where you ramp up
[SPEAKER_07]: their production from two four sixty kilo
sixty tons We've imported 30 tons now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what the balance will be from the
demand?
[SPEAKER_07]: the local demand for for medical cannabis
and the local production we will see how
[SPEAKER_05]: that will will unfold so so once once You
know domestic production will just you
[SPEAKER_05]: know increase and new players will come
online Of course the single convention as
[SPEAKER_05]: you said says that if there's enough
production then you don't have you can
[SPEAKER_05]: block the importer so like what will be
the consequences for example for all of
[SPEAKER_05]: this producers in other countries such as
You know Portugal, Macedonia, Colombia a
[SPEAKER_05]: minute, you know ready probably selling to
Germany Would they be just not not be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to sell any more into the country?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes You heard that but but but wait Kai
There is one crucial thing when it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: to medical cannabis from my perspective So
and five years ago where the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: business started here in in Germany or in
Europe particularly We thought okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many facilities we can buy
Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the lowest problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not the bottleneck then we were
into the business and discovered Wow It's
[SPEAKER_02]: not very easy to grow cannabis on the
medical grade month by month week by week
[SPEAKER_02]: to harvest all two weeks and deliver the
same product in the same range of
[SPEAKER_02]: parameters So it's not like easy putting
money on the table buying a facility
[SPEAKER_02]: starting the grow maybe in three years
This will be the first productive grow
[SPEAKER_02]: when you start right now so it's not like
BAM and you have the Facility race and if
[SPEAKER_02]: the the process change and the value
change are already established I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: change my supplier just because there is a
new one because I'm so related to the
[SPEAKER_02]: quality and the consistency of these
processes so I think Now new suppliers in
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany coming to the market to run grow
facilities will have a very hard-standing
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to the economics at the
beginning 100% I can just confirm that I
[SPEAKER_08]: mean we know how long it has taken up to
run the facility Well, and we're still
[SPEAKER_08]: optimizing everything every day So to get
a GMP facility to get the GMP certificate
[SPEAKER_08]: which you need in the European Union in
order to produce medical cannabis it is
[SPEAKER_04]: quite a long run and Maybe I know Kai you
have this Opinion from a legal perspective
[SPEAKER_04]: just like really from the business
perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have established international supply
chains We have great products brought to
[SPEAKER_04]: the market and we have low-cost products
we have high quality products and in
[SPEAKER_04]: general I would say more likely licensed
producers also domestically could lead to
[SPEAKER_04]: further competition, which is generally
good for the patients for the whole system
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if I would place my bet I would
kind of disagree I think there will be a
[SPEAKER_04]: future for imports and international
supply chains and we'll figure a way out
[SPEAKER_04]: over the next few years how this will look
like but I also agree with with you Philip
[SPEAKER_04]: that those that have like a head start and
have existing Cultivation sites
[SPEAKER_04]: domestically established that they will
definitely play a role in the future And
[SPEAKER_04]: the key question is will there be further
significant funds for those?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say up to a hundred potentially
additional cultivators maybe to add one
[SPEAKER_08]: more point I think the the only important
question now is the SP dimension the
[SPEAKER_08]: column to you know The second part of the
law if that will come then everything for
[SPEAKER_08]: this recreational market has to be grown
in Germany Obviously, I mean, I think we
[SPEAKER_08]: are in a good position for that as well
And then obviously more competitors may
[SPEAKER_08]: enter the market because it has to be
grown domestically The question is then
[SPEAKER_08]: what is will be the legal frame or the
regulatory framework to better said which
[SPEAKER_05]: needs to be Accomplished is that going to
be also for by the way for adult use I
[SPEAKER_05]: heard In the future potentially when
commercialization is allowed still in
[SPEAKER_07]: indoors GMP Now due to the international
regulations if the model projects come the
[SPEAKER_07]: supply for the model products have to be
cultivated in Germany and if you plan now
[SPEAKER_07]: to establish your own facility Your own
cultivation facility you are in a better
[SPEAKER_07]: position to supply also the model projects
which are coming But to answer your
[SPEAKER_08]: question, I think it really depends if you
still need you GMP We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that's the highest standard we
have
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's somewhere between food and GMP.
[SPEAKER_08]: We we don't know yet, but we obviously say
okay stick to GMP You know what you have
[SPEAKER_08]: and you have a good quality in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so and now about the adult use So,
how do you see this coming?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm sure that the everybody in you
know at this conference wants to know
[SPEAKER_05]: about potential consequences of this kind
of these clubs their social clubs They're
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of different From the ones in Spain
obviously who's actually illegal 500 max
[SPEAKER_05]: Members, we don't know which location By
the way, the member has to drive right to
[SPEAKER_05]: the facility, but they can actually carry
it out I don't know what would be the
[SPEAKER_05]: consequences for you know the medical side
and also as a as a let's say as a patient
[SPEAKER_05]: as a user would it be cheaper or more,
you know economic or easier for me to to
[SPEAKER_05]: get mechanical cannabis as a medical
patient or as a You know member of the of
[SPEAKER_04]: the clubs Yeah, maybe I kick it off thanks
Thomas so First of all, the only
[SPEAKER_04]: commercially addressable market is the
medical market as of now So the whole kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of social club system, it's for
non-commercial purposes That's important
[SPEAKER_04]: to understand and what would be the
dynamics from our perspective?
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, we had the rescheduling of
cannabis as a non-narcotic and I think All
[SPEAKER_04]: of us here and the panel saw over the last
two weeks probably significant impact in
[SPEAKER_04]: our sales and revenue, which is great so
we see that there is a seamless easy
[SPEAKER_04]: patient journey that those patients get
those products get cannabis that's like
[SPEAKER_04]: very important and The the key question is
will there be in the future people going
[SPEAKER_04]: into self-therapy through those cannabis
social clubs, for example or will those
[SPEAKER_04]: patients go to like reliable high quality
Established supply chains and also
[SPEAKER_04]: products.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that we will see However,
my opinion is if it is a easy patient
[SPEAKER_04]: journey, which is possible This commercial
addressable market is the one that will
[SPEAKER_04]: probably have a significant impact And I
believe that when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational adult use system we need to
wait a little bit on actually the pillar
[SPEAKER_04]: two of the Law that might come over the
next few years and this will be probably
[SPEAKER_04]: from the commercial perspective the one
That might have more impact on the overall
[SPEAKER_04]: system than the kind of a social clubs
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will see what happens Maybe to add to
your question regarding pricing and what
[SPEAKER_08]: does it mean for the end customer patient
consumer in the end?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean right now you go to the pharmacy
and you pay the same price as on the black
[SPEAKER_08]: market So already right now and as when I
said the journey is quite simple Seven to
[SPEAKER_08]: ten years in the pharmacy you can get a
gram of cannabis so I think For a social
[SPEAKER_08]: club to get to that level and to
accomplish that quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a long way To have yeah enough funds
to really realize that Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So well, by the way, do you do you know
how much is going to be the cost?
[SPEAKER_05]: The cost per gram or you know how much
they're gonna have to pay the members of
[SPEAKER_05]: the clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's differing Depending on the club what
kind of style they they are have we are we
[SPEAKER_02]: are seeing clubs that would require a
yearly fee of 3000 4000 euro we see clubs
[SPEAKER_02]: that is a fee like 500 euros.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is very very different But when it
comes to a market question, how will this
[SPEAKER_02]: affect at the long run?
[SPEAKER_02]: The market who will deliver the most
convenient process to a customer slash
[SPEAKER_02]: patient will do the run Because even if I
would be a recreational User for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: but my customer journey is much more easy
to get it over a pharmacy because they do
[SPEAKER_02]: delivery for example door-to-door and the
recreational or my cannabis club is 20
[SPEAKER_02]: kilometers away and I have to go there I
will do this maybe one or two times and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I will say I Go for the Amazon
concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just click and I get it in front of my
door So basically there will be market for
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone recreational medical For example,
if we just see we invited a lot of road We
[SPEAKER_02]: clubs a lot of Lions clubs into our
facility just to show how cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: produced how the variety of medical
cannabis is shown to people who use this
[SPEAKER_02]: as a medical treatment and they are Really
apologizing after this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we never know that we just thought
that this is just the joint and nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: more so you see even those kind of
customer groups in the future will grow
[SPEAKER_02]: because more and more people are getting
rid of their fears and this big stigma of
[SPEAKER_02]: narcotic is gone here in Germany and I
think this is the biggest market booster
[SPEAKER_02]: in total and at the end Convenience will
do the business and the run.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah convenience actually we like to talk
about convenience in the medical market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and this Declassification at this
point I think that maybe on a side note
[SPEAKER_05]: this adult use my help for the stigma
thing So that more actually patients more
[SPEAKER_05]: people, you know can actually get to you
know Think I'm gonna use cannabis but the
[SPEAKER_05]: declassification or so actually in Germany
As a patient the situation was already
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty comfortable because online clinics
all you had to do was just the first visit
[SPEAKER_05]: right the first visit in person with the
doctor and then Everything else could be
[SPEAKER_05]: done online and also delivered Amazon
style Home prices are you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously now with the classification what
happens?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do everything online.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's no more a narcotic so they
say It's going to be easier also for
[SPEAKER_05]: prescriptions that what does he mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: That you know, the process is going to be
easier also for doctors and patients So
[SPEAKER_02]: first of all, I think we can all agree on
that one The most biggest workload for us,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example was the B farm communication
and all the documentation you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: deliver week by week after two numbers
after the comma and all that stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: this is gone by now immediately which
makes us a Lot of easier just doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: processes internally Plus the most crucial
thing for the industry is really getting
[SPEAKER_02]: rid of this stigma So it was really
categorized as a narcotic and in the media
[SPEAKER_02]: it was dealt as the worst narcotic ever
poison poison invented on this planet and
[SPEAKER_02]: This is gone now and you see a lot of
doctors also they were so scared of
[SPEAKER_02]: applying for a narcotic prescription
because the process is Not that hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: get one But of course then you are
monitored a lot of doctors said I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to be monitored and I don't want to
have all this work just for I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 euros so I'm out of it and with this
gone they have a different approach
[SPEAKER_02]: towards it because they are not so Focused
anymore with with this narcotic stuff and
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not a last-line therapy anymore So
previously as a narcotic you could only
[SPEAKER_08]: use it as a last-line therapy like
morphine and so on so forth So now it can
[SPEAKER_05]: be really used like Ibuprofen So this is
very important actually because it's part
[SPEAKER_05]: of the medical market, which is a great
market because you tap into a Huge market
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially can be also covered by the
healthcare system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the pharma world, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is kind of new for many of us But
yes, so let's let's for example now you
[SPEAKER_05]: just said something new that I didn't know
about the the narcotic license doctors
[SPEAKER_05]: have to get a narcotic license In order to
not really a license.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are two types of prescription
There is a blue one, which is the regular
[SPEAKER_02]: one and the yellow one, which is the
narcotic stuff and for that you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: apply at B farm you have to send your
Diploma as a doctor to the B farm then
[SPEAKER_02]: fill out a paper and then you get a bunch
of prescription Send it to your doctor's
[SPEAKER_02]: place and then you can use this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to really apply for that Okay,
so how do we grow the the market of
[SPEAKER_05]: doctors?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we grow the number?
[SPEAKER_05]: of doctors and therefore also the
prescription so something that I actually
[SPEAKER_05]: have Dived into for the cannabis medical
market is the fact that you know Sometimes
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not a patient consumer driven,
but it's doctors driven right differently
[SPEAKER_05]: from the recreational adult use market So
how do you engage?
[SPEAKER_05]: Doctors in to to learn how to prescribe to
believe in it and then it's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: actually become a job for the Doctor
because I've actually studied this There's
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be follow-ups and you know time
required by the doctor and therefore he
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously wants to get paid and then
there's liabilities to that so the
[SPEAKER_05]: training the Payment, you know the rewards
for the doctors and the health care system
[SPEAKER_05]: You know when when patients can actually
take advantage of the health care system
[SPEAKER_05]: or not So I studied this in a few
countries in Europe like Italy for example
[SPEAKER_05]: is completely pharma so and there's
actually a certain number of pathologies
[SPEAKER_05]: that are Accepted, you know by the health
care system then it goes region by region,
[SPEAKER_05]: of course, but also depends doctor by
doctor if it's a specialist or not a
[SPEAKER_05]: specialist generalist or In hospital,
so I would like to know as a you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: how how do you how can patients,
you know get their cannabis covered and
[SPEAKER_05]: how our clinics, you know benefiting from
such a thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so what you're talking Is the
reimbursement part which is still
[SPEAKER_08]: difficult in Germany because it's still a
last-line therapy in terms of
[SPEAKER_08]: reimbursement You got to differentiate
between the narcotic and the reimbursement
[SPEAKER_08]: part So cannabis can be prescribed to
anyone right now on a script as Thomas
[SPEAKER_08]: said But you got to pay it out of pocket
if you want a reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lengthy process You got to prove
that you have tried every other therapy
[SPEAKER_08]: first and then even then often it's
rejected Because often they say there's
[SPEAKER_08]: not enough evidence to really Do the
reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think this doesn't change right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: This won't change very fast in the future
There are some things going on where they
[SPEAKER_08]: try to easing it for some medical
professionals But it's a it's a lengthy
[SPEAKER_08]: process and those patients who want and
need a reimbursement Will need to continue
[SPEAKER_07]: to fight for that But with the price of
seven to eight nine euros per gram The
[SPEAKER_07]: self-payer don't really look for
reimbursement anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're paid out of pocket voluntarily and
never apply for reimbursement So this is
[SPEAKER_07]: only a problem for real people who really
need medicine and will really need the
[SPEAKER_04]: support of the public health insurance and
Maybe just adding some more color on how
[SPEAKER_04]: the market looks like so in the past so
let's say Last and the year before we were
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about maybe 50% self-payers 50%
patients under statutory health coverage
[SPEAKER_04]: now We are probably rather talking about
60 maybe 70 percent self-payers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's that's one important impact to
the market And we see that I mean each
[SPEAKER_04]: doctor could prescribe cannabis I mean not
dentists not that's obviously but
[SPEAKER_04]: generally each doctor we see I know 20
plus telemedicine providers right now that
[SPEAKER_04]: are also offering their service some very
bullish and we see some especially pain
[SPEAKER_04]: specialists that are really focusing on
cannabis as a therapy option and Because
[SPEAKER_04]: you ask how to like educate them how to
train them It's like for me the key topic
[SPEAKER_04]: right now is destigmatization Not in the
cottage prescription anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really sounds so silly and so easy,
but that's like really really a Key and
[SPEAKER_04]: door opener and then second education and
this means for example interface to
[SPEAKER_04]: product information systems and so on and
different companies have different
[SPEAKER_04]: solutions But that those doctors really
have the chance to get transparency of 400
[SPEAKER_04]: plus flowers in the market of I don't know
200 150 extracts in the market,
[SPEAKER_04]: so it's getting complex there and at the
same time It's still a quite patient
[SPEAKER_04]: driven market, especially in the flowers
market So we still have the challenge as a
[SPEAKER_04]: company that we cannot or very limited
address patients with Marketing with
[SPEAKER_04]: information so we always need to go to the
doctor or the pharmacist to somehow get
[SPEAKER_05]: the message out in the market Is it going
to change anything about the marketing
[SPEAKER_05]: advertising or at least education of the
patients with this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Scheduling.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes before that it was a criminal offense
to advertise for medical cannabis we're 14
[SPEAKER_07]: 5 of the Narcotic Act and now it will be
in the in another act But it will be only
[SPEAKER_07]: a fine and not a criminal offense anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can Do some more Business
perspective you could kind of assess what
[SPEAKER_04]: is the cost for a certain activity?
[SPEAKER_04]: But but still we are talking about quite
significant fines and significant
[SPEAKER_04]: downsides But in the past it was jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean that was easy decision Well,
this is changing gradually all over the
[SPEAKER_05]: world.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's in many other countries So that's
very exciting last question that I would
[SPEAKER_05]: like to open for questions from the public
from the audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry Domino's domino's effect or
potential influence to the rest of Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think in each vertical or you
know?
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% this will happen So I would even say
that most countries in Europe will be even
[SPEAKER_02]: more bullish than Germany when it comes to
the Legalization framework.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say especially Czech Republic We
hear more and more rumors that they will
[SPEAKER_02]: even skip this medical part and just go
all in right from the beginning So let's
[SPEAKER_02]: see, but this was a very very big issue
impact on all the other countries for sure
[SPEAKER_05]: There's any questions from the audience
[SPEAKER_06]: Questions questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right All the way up.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a microphone right up there so
that my lazy ass Doesn't have to climb
[SPEAKER_06]: these stairs 16 times a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Trenton Birch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I come from South Africa I'd like to know
what the panel's opinion is on the future
[SPEAKER_03]: of outdoor cultivation Because obviously
at the moment the farmer industry is very
[SPEAKER_03]: much leading Medical cannabis,
but we all know that cultivating outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: and the netting or under tunnels or green
door is Vastly different in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think there is a future for
outdoor?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis for the medical industry from the
likes of Columbia and South Africa,
[SPEAKER_03]: etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks So when once there will be a
recreational market here for sure right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now in the medical market, it's really
hard to achieve the micro values when you
[SPEAKER_02]: do hundred percent outdoor I'm very honest
to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Visited now I think hundred fifty
growing facilities in the last five years
[SPEAKER_02]: from outdoor greenhouse indoor whatever
kind of quality and I have to really admit
[SPEAKER_02]: that medical grade hundred percent
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is this is more than challenging
and if you have on the other hands
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities who do the run indoor Producing
decent quality to a decent price not using
[SPEAKER_02]: radiation Because I would sense that there
would be radiation needed for for micro
[SPEAKER_02]: level bringing down if you do 100% outdoor
But I don't know but this will be a hard
[SPEAKER_06]: hard challenge for the medical market
Anyone else have a question anyone closer
[SPEAKER_06]: to me perhaps All right, you've all been
thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you so much I guess there's
Hearing a lot and I'm very interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: the German market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live here and I helped develop the
business Economic Development Agency of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Federal Republic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right from the top back when it was the
Commissioner for foreign investment To
[SPEAKER_00]: invest in Germany the German trade invest
and I've been hearing a lot from doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: about a database that's coming out I'm not
really sure but they're gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting it's supposed to be also coming
out Do you guys know about the status base
[SPEAKER_00]: while they're giving practical?
[SPEAKER_00]: experience how to other doctors about
Everything from Parkinson's to where it
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used sleep For whatever use this is
something that one of the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: groups in Germany is doing any anybody
know about that or Not in particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: because there are so many of these
projects and we as an industry We are
[SPEAKER_02]: working very very closely together on that
when it comes to education show Because
[SPEAKER_02]: there were so many doctors already
applying for cannabis the last five years
[SPEAKER_02]: which are very well known among the
doctors circles so to say and we try to
[SPEAKER_02]: make videos with them to Together bringing
this to educational platforms sharing
[SPEAKER_02]: everything just to educate them So I will
be very very sure that there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: something like this in the future very
nearby There is a German group working on
[SPEAKER_00]: it one of the pharmaceutical companies
right now is putting together a database
[SPEAKER_00]: for and that will be shared all the little
Qualitate circles that the German doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: have they're they're getting this
information now But if you're it depends
[SPEAKER_08]: really on what kind of data you look at if
you're looking really at I mean what the
[SPEAKER_08]: German reimbursement system when we come
back to That point values is like phase
[SPEAKER_08]: three double-blind data, and you won't
have that from what you described There
[SPEAKER_08]: are too many strains out there too many
extracts as we described to really get
[SPEAKER_08]: reliable medical data Which then can be
used in terms of what German doctors
[SPEAKER_08]: adhere often to and that's what we try to
educate Hey, let's talk about cannabis as
[SPEAKER_08]: such about duty and the potency and then
try out on how to best Try to find the
[SPEAKER_06]: best fit for your patient in the end Good
I would like to ask a question about that
[SPEAKER_06]: too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean I feel like it's a challenge
because Cannabis is so different person to
[SPEAKER_06]: person like one person Really likes og
cush another person has completely
[SPEAKER_06]: different effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it makes one person sleepy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It keeps one person awake How do you
quantify that how do you make it so that
[SPEAKER_06]: I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't even know so I think in the long run
when it comes to a data perspective first
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that the doctors will do will
clustering diseases and certain kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts or flowers or even turbine
profiles and then you can just put your
[SPEAKER_02]: strains which are fitting into certain
profiles into that because Even if you
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the data, of course, there will be
some exceptions for that Top to down as
[SPEAKER_02]: well, but you can definitely find
something like okay This strain is working
[SPEAKER_02]: for maybe 60% of the patients for going to
bed This strain is working maybe 80% for
[SPEAKER_02]: the person or 30% you never know and with
this kind of data you will make the the
[SPEAKER_02]: business not even for us but for the
doctors for everyone in the industry much
[SPEAKER_02]: more easier when it comes to this
categorization because we have to do that
[SPEAKER_02]: not no pharmacy is willing to to have 500
strains in their vault and in their
[SPEAKER_02]: storage because it's a logistical
nightmare to be honest and Therefore we
[SPEAKER_02]: have to strip this down into very very
functional groups of yeah diseases turbine
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis profiles and then you go from
there Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a question up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the pounding guys doing a great
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: What rules?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does CBD and other minor cannabinoids come
to play in the medical market in Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second part of the question is
format other than flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other formats do you see coming
online?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I kick it off here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first of all, if we are talking about
the medical cannabis market, we typically
[SPEAKER_04]: mean THC content above 0.5% so I would say
this panel here represents really not a
[SPEAKER_04]: the relevance of Any CBD product typical
forms that we have are flowers around 60%
[SPEAKER_04]: of the market revenue then another around
maybe 20 25% is full spectrum extract and
[SPEAKER_04]: the rest is like isolate which is mainly
dronabinal this means mattress or
[SPEAKER_04]: formulations and then there are like very
very Limited finished products that are
[SPEAKER_04]: available.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say CBD is not playing a
relevant role as of now In the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: market and when it comes to the forms,
we are still very much at the beginning
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but research is going on on to that
because for example in the US we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational market so we have more
options to test products and we just Find
[SPEAKER_02]: out that if you for example do a certain
kind of timeline for single Cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: in the pill or something like this working
after one hour after three hour after five
[SPEAKER_02]: hour You can really steer for example the
sleeping process Up to eight hours totally
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled and this is something we have
to learn But with the upcoming industry in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe the upcoming researchers data
collections, I think in the next years We
[SPEAKER_02]: will have some good outcome for all of us
Maybe I can add to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw companies trying to bring CBD,
so we E liquid weight pen on the market
[SPEAKER_07]: for THC for patients, but this is a very
complicated procedure So you need a CE you
[SPEAKER_07]: need a pre market authorization You need a
CE mark approved by an expert group and
[SPEAKER_07]: this is very hard to achieve or to get and
Companies still trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll still have to wait for for that
even for that small simple product So
[SPEAKER_05]: actually I have a question about the
formulas you actually touched into
[SPEAKER_05]: something that I that I like So you talked
about the profile of minor cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes formulas pathologies So now the
EU monograph if I'm not if I'm correct and
[SPEAKER_05]: the German monograph does not require The
the disclosing of minor cannabinoids or
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes only THC and CBD correct,
but you're actually going further so I I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean Are you when you are you testing also
for for the for the other companies?
[SPEAKER_05]: components of the flower the extract yes
sure because we as an industry we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn about our products, of course and
how they work and Yeah Cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more complicated because it's
has such an individual effect on the on
[SPEAKER_02]: the human body and so for we have to learn
that but of course standardization of
[SPEAKER_02]: products is one of our main goals and
Therefore we have to do the research on
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you said there shouldn't be too many
Types of genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, everybody goes crazy Or we
don't know how to follow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you chosen your genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many my personal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean for yes Three I I selected by
myself and of course, we have some more
[SPEAKER_02]: guys in the team, but two of those I
selected personally were market hitters so
[SPEAKER_08]: But you got to say that there's really big
demand for huge variation I mean as you
[SPEAKER_08]: said it's nightmare from supply chain
perspective, but you got to see what the
[SPEAKER_08]: market Wants so there's always quite some
requests to get new product as well on the
[SPEAKER_08]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: What does the market want?
[SPEAKER_05]: So so good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to cut you off.
[SPEAKER_06]: See hi Actually out of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it was just really getting good,
but we're we're over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it again for the whole panel
Dr. Goebel and Thomas shouldn't I'm sure
[SPEAKER_06]: if you want to talk more they'll talk to
you out there This is the Berlin
[SPEAKER_06]: international cannabis business conference
2024.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd like to think the Toman group our
title sponsor We'd like to thank all of y
[SPEAKER_06]: 'all for coming out Don't forget.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a big party tonight in the
showroom and You can get tickets for next
[SPEAKER_06]: year this year probably and we're gonna be
in Slovenia at Lake bled for a science and
[SPEAKER_06]: technology forum in September
