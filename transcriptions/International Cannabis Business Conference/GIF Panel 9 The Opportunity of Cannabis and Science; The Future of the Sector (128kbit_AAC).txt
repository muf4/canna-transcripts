[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will do in the science panel what I will
do since we're not going to moderate this
[SPEAKER_05]: one either.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have these guys introduce my
esteemed colleagues and their background
[SPEAKER_05]: in science.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll jump into a question or two and
then kick it out to you guys on where
[SPEAKER_05]: these guys think it's going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gio, do you want to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Giovanni Venturini.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I've been working in the bio
refining space since at least 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: After graduating in engineering,
I started to work on second generation
[SPEAKER_00]: biofuels in Africa from non-food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I moved to the biomaterials where I
started a company called Agroilz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that company is producing bio glues,
bio resins for replacing formaldehyde in
[SPEAKER_00]: wood panel production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I actually learned first
time about hemp, because I was looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: protein sources to be used in the bio
resin formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started a second company
dedicated to cannabis and hemp in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Herbolea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are specialized in solventless
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We develop a number of technologies for
obtaining concentrate, vape liquids with
[SPEAKER_00]: different cannabinoids, terpenes fraction,
starting from fresh material.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's your educational background?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was saying, so I study industrial
engineer in University of Florence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I spent a year at Cote Hoa in
Stockholm in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of experience on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to mention perhaps that I had as
a mentor biotechnologist that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: first inventor at Genentech a few years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned a lot from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's Professor Roberto Crea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, now I have like eight
between patent and patent applications.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sir?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I started my career at Imperial
College as an academic drug developer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Developed a number of targeted biological
therapies and spun out patents that ended
[SPEAKER_07]: up becoming biotech companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then spent a period of time at Harvard
Medical School doing similar types of
[SPEAKER_07]: research, at which point I pivoted my
career into technological
[SPEAKER_07]: entrepreneurship.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then spent the last 15 years in that
sort of vein, eventually bringing myself
[SPEAKER_07]: back actually to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Primarily because what I saw was an
industry that really had a deep need to be
[SPEAKER_07]: able to address complex questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the best process we have today for
that is called science.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so from that point of view,
I saw a real opportunity with the way that
[SPEAKER_07]: things had been scheduled and also
therefore grants had been blocked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Universities couldn't do the research that
was required.
[SPEAKER_07]: That we could create an innovative company
that could actually address or build a
[SPEAKER_07]: platform and an innovation investment
system to be able to develop that early
[SPEAKER_07]: stage research and capitalize upon it.
[SPEAKER_07]: My personal interest there really comes
from the fact that as a drug developer in
[SPEAKER_07]: my early career, it felt like we were
developing drugs that blunted and kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: dampened the issue rather than found real
cures.
[SPEAKER_07]: And cannabinoids were interesting to me
for a long time, primarily because they
[SPEAKER_07]: still didn't teach them, and they still
don't teach them in medical school.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they interact in a fundamentally
interesting way in the fact that they
[SPEAKER_07]: interact with the brain, the neurological
system, and with the immunological system.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it gives you an incredibly new way to
think about how you might cure diseases
[SPEAKER_07]: that are more on the lines of complex
non-communicable diseases.
[SPEAKER_07]: My background, I've got a BSc in
biochemistry and genetics, PhD in
[SPEAKER_07]: molecular biology and biochemistry,
and an MBA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eric?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is working here?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I first became familiar with
cannabinoids in the 1980s, I think in the
[SPEAKER_03]: early 80s and the latter part of the 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd been a member of the American
Chemical Society for I think over 23 years
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: My most recent experience with
cannabinoids began in 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at the University of Tubingen at the
Institute of Organic Chemistry there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had a vaping crisis in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people from the United States had
contacted me and asked me what we could do
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as finding a safe diluence for THC
that was going into these vaping carts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I studied a little bit about the
problem, which was lipoid pneumonia at the
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we began looking into this a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one day as I was looking at compounds,
we pulled into the parking lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: university.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I looked at the structure of CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I looked at the structure of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: These compounds are so similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be very easy to cyclisize CBD
into THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they were doing this in the United
States at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked and we found in the patent
literature that other people had done this
[SPEAKER_03]: previously.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we thought, well, we could make a nice
solid supported catalyst for doing this
[SPEAKER_03]: and perhaps sell it to licensed companies
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was our first solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was our first business model.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we began making derivatives of
CBD pro drugs and THC, which were water
[SPEAKER_03]: soluble and had increased bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so basically, I would say since that
time, we've been focused on making
[SPEAKER_03]: modifications to cannabinoids and novel
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lately, I've been directed toward the
recreational markets here in Europe and
[SPEAKER_03]: also in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's primarily the focus of Tresco
Labs, which as I said- In your educational
[SPEAKER_03]: background?
[SPEAKER_03]: Educational background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my educational background is a
Bachelor of Science degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not as- Decorated.
[SPEAKER_03]: As decorated.
[SPEAKER_03]: As decorated, yes, as Sebastian is.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a person who provides such very
articulate answers to many of the
[SPEAKER_03]: questions, we have to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am quite proud of you for that,
Sebastian.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do have a lot of experience in
organic synthesis over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's primarily what I'm focused on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have, just like Giovanni,
I have spent time at Genentech where they
[SPEAKER_03]: teach us that the process is the product.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a reason why I put this panel
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: So essentially, Eric is working out of
Frankfurt.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have Gio working out of Florence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have Seb, you're working out of
north of London.
[SPEAKER_05]: South of London, but yeah, UK.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had that 50-50.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so essentially, Eric kind of does the
molecular side.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seb's looking at the business end.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then certainly, Gio's looking and has
technologies as far as separations or
[SPEAKER_05]: inclusions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess starting with you, Gio,
what are a few of the things, three,
[SPEAKER_05]: two, three things that you see most
exciting on the near-term horizon,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's 12 months, 18 months,
that's going to make the most impact?
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether we're talking about cannabis,
cannabinoids, or something in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, also from the questions
that I raised to the previous panels,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that here we are assisting to a
bit of dichotomy between, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: the European market or rest of the world
and the US, where the US is, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: an open lab for experimenting what is
interesting from a consumer perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: more than a patient perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that if we look at what would
be the development of the European sector,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe in a bit more than one year,
if some recreational market, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to open also in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the importance of
understanding what the consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only the patient, but also the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say patient and consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we mentioned today that the separation
between these two concepts is sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: not easy to make, but what really the
consumer wants is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my point is that, for instance,
when I was studying a bit this sector,
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a pharmacist and I was looking
at the way they were producing the
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture, the cannabinoid tincture,
the boiling the dry flour in oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were obtaining a tincture that was
like smelling of rotten fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked, so it smelled bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think this is what we
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer by the pharmacist was,
but that's a medicine, so it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to taste nice or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the mentality that I found at
least in Italy three, four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it hasn't changed so much in Italy at
least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that what is important to
understand is that the quality and having
[SPEAKER_00]: product that really meet the expectation
by the consumer and can be good for them
[SPEAKER_00]: and can be pleasant is also very
important, also in the medical sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that regard, I think that,
for instance, what we are doing with some
[SPEAKER_00]: partners in California, we are developing
this solventless product, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my view, represent what is what the
market is demanding for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it meets a lot of ESG,
let's say, point on the way that the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer can understand that there is no
organic solvent being used in the
[SPEAKER_00]: production process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for instance, in a product that he has
to inhale, that's something that the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer is growing a consciousness on
what is inhaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, let's say, obtaining products
that can be of high quality and can meet
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumer expectations now and the
future expectation, I think is very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Sam?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I think the most exciting thing
in the next two years, firstly,
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say that science time is a bit
like geological time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It runs way slower than investors or maybe
cannabis cultivators would like it to.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's the nature of the beast.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can tell you what we're working on
that we're fundamentally excited about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is a platform for utilizing data
science to surface and develop pipelines
[SPEAKER_07]: of biopharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, historically, there are, we've been
focused on THC and CBD fundamentally.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most people in the room today are
focused primarily on their knowledge base
[SPEAKER_07]: on those two molecules.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's 100 cannabinoids, there's 23,000
terpenes, there's 10,000 flavonoids out
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of those you can get to in high
abundance in the plants, some of them you
[SPEAKER_07]: can't.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, what we lack in this industry is
the ability to connect the market with the
[SPEAKER_07]: production.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is fundamentally a question of
function in the human body, which we don't
[SPEAKER_07]: yet have a good answer to.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I'm fundamentally excited about
over the next two years is the data
[SPEAKER_07]: science that we're doing around
correlating plant production or natural
[SPEAKER_07]: abundance with known data in the
literature, primarily scientific
[SPEAKER_07]: literature and our own that we're
generating in our labs, and then
[SPEAKER_07]: developing concepts of how we might think
about disease, not in the Cartesian model
[SPEAKER_07]: of Alzheimer's, cancer, so on and so
forth, but in what are the core common
[SPEAKER_07]: features of those diseases like
dysregulated inflammation and so on and so
[SPEAKER_07]: forth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that we're designing clinical trials
that actually have relevant endpoints for
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoid-based medicines or molecules
that may be coming out of that same plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you look at the data,
I think there's something like 400 trials,
[SPEAKER_07]: only 40 of them have reported.
[SPEAKER_07]: That means the rest of them have basically
flunked and they've not even bothered.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of those, I think 20 are around sort of
successful, and most of those are based on
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're only just scratching the surface
of what could be a trillion-dollar market
[SPEAKER_07]: in the future, but we've got to go and do
the legwork to get there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what I'm really excited about,
David.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what I'm excited about is I speak to
people on a daily basis who, in the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States and in Europe, move metric tons of
cannabinoids into the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I hear from them every day and
every week what's going on in the industry
[SPEAKER_03]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a very volatile industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think, personally, that what we're
going to see, and a thing that I'm very
[SPEAKER_03]: excited about and what we're working on,
is having materials that are
[SPEAKER_03]: non-psychoactive, that consumers can
easily access, but that they can have
[SPEAKER_03]: tools in place to be able to modify these
non-psychoactive, completely unregulated
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds if they want to into compounds
that are, say, for example, CB1 receptor
[SPEAKER_03]: agonists, which are greatly in demand in
the United States and in Europe and in
[SPEAKER_03]: other markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see this really as the way forward,
and also as the way forward for marketers
[SPEAKER_03]: is being able to put tools in the hands of
the patients where the patients can make a
[SPEAKER_03]: decision if they want to to produce a
substance that might be considered
[SPEAKER_03]: controlled in their jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is an area that I'm working on
every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is rather exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to add, probably kind of treading the
line in between everybody here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we mentioned earlier we're a lead
sponsor of CanMed.
[SPEAKER_05]: In April, we were able to put on the stage
with myself, some of the leading
[SPEAKER_05]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that was really
interesting that came out of that is
[SPEAKER_05]: having the next killer app, if you will,
on cannabis and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you live in the States, especially
in Colorado, when you saw in 2012,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of people moving to Colorado when it
was one of the first legal states because
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of mothers and fathers had kids that
had epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the easiest access was to come to
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you guys know, mothers and fathers will
do anything for their kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that, I think, was the first killer
app, if you will, on cannabis or CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's the thing that we're
searching for is what's the next really
[SPEAKER_05]: killer app.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one thing that came out of CanMed that
was really interesting that came out of a
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation on stage with Deddy Myrie and
Ethan Rousseau is they think women's
[SPEAKER_05]: health is going to be one of the next
low-hanging fruits for cannabis and
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing that I think touching on,
Erick, and what Gio is doing is where this
[SPEAKER_05]: molecular world's going to go as far as
making some of these new, I know Erick
[SPEAKER_05]: said before, one of the main things he's
selling here in Europe is HHC,
[SPEAKER_05]: hexahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of these minors in the production
of those, and then actually trying to find
[SPEAKER_05]: out what those do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you guys, everybody knows here,
there's still a stigma.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we can do more data, get better
molecules, more consistent, high-quality
[SPEAKER_05]: molecules, we're going to get rid of,
we're going to definitely get rid of the
[SPEAKER_05]: stigma.
[SPEAKER_05]: One other question before we put it out,
really talking to all you guys on stage,
[SPEAKER_05]: innovation has not had a lot to do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And intellectual property has not had a
lot to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe getting to more specific points,
Gio, if you want to start off as far as
[SPEAKER_05]: your thoughts on what we can do better
with innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a very interesting angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been keeping track on patent,
patent application in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there has been a pretty
interesting ramp up three, four years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: on the patent application that were filed
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: On different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting to notice,
by the way, that some of the largest,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say some of the companies most
active in filing patent applications on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and cannabis in general,
actually were pharma companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end, let's say their commercial
activity on the field has been,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, with exclusion of GW until last
year, has been limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm referring to the big pharma
companies, big pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So despite having some interesting patents
around that, they were pretty limited in
[SPEAKER_00]: the commercial exploitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that puzzled me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, having patent protection,
but not getting to the market with final
[SPEAKER_00]: product is something that really puzzled
me, I think, a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a specific answer for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the statistics that
have been published earlier also this
[SPEAKER_00]: year, wherever cannabis has been legalized
to a certain extent, there has been
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly a decrease in opioids
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe the simple answer is that
allowing, of course, big use of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sector would have a big impact also
on the sales of other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's maybe a very simple answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality coming, just to comment
also the previous point that you were
[SPEAKER_00]: making, David, on the stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's really ridiculous
that opioids prescription is done in such
[SPEAKER_00]: a light and easy manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was personally, let's say,
exploring a bit the opioids consumption in
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacies just in my city, Florence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's simply crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we are talking about really a
percentage of the population that is
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there should be a short period for
treatment with opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once these people enter the loop,
they cannot exit easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found it really ridiculous that
doctors then can prescribe and pharmacists
[SPEAKER_00]: can provide opioids in such an easy
manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is still a stigma on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, the length of the treatment,
for instance, in Italy is often made
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult because of the lack of
availability of the products to the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that this will get better.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got three things on IP.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we started Phytome Life Sciences,
we made a very strong decision not to
[SPEAKER_07]: straddle ourselves between production and
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And being a research company, we're 100% a
research company focused on the
[SPEAKER_07]: development of intellectual property,
the licensing of it, and commercialization
[SPEAKER_07]: of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a very important thing to
think about.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not start any wet research unless
we've done a patterned landscape search,
[SPEAKER_07]: which we have an intellectual property
office for.
[SPEAKER_07]: And number three, fundamentally,
is if you're not willing to defend a
[SPEAKER_07]: patent, i.e.
[SPEAKER_07]: you've got the cash to do so, do not go
and publish everything you know about that
[SPEAKER_07]: process because someone's going to copy
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're not going to be able to defend
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're going to be able to do nothing
about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that's clear enough for everybody
in the room what I think about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you were talking about innovation,
David, in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say what I think is
interesting is how fast the market has
[SPEAKER_03]: responded to some key peer-reviewed papers
that we had on alkyl chain derivatives of,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had, and these, I think,
papers, at least the first one came out of
[SPEAKER_03]: an Italian university, didn't it,
with what they called the THC by Forall or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the Heptal chain, the Heptal
alkyl chain derivative.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we began to see in the United
States production of THCP, they called it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was for the Heptal alkyl chain
derivative.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, immediately after
that came the HHCP, which was a Heptal
[SPEAKER_03]: chain derivative there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people got to know firsthand that
these alkyl chain derivatives of the
[SPEAKER_03]: classic cannabinoids could provide a more
powerful effect or an equivalent effect
[SPEAKER_03]: with a smaller dose and that they lasted
for a longer period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that the consumer base with
many of these products has experientially
[SPEAKER_03]: learned how different modifications to
these molecules are capable of influencing
[SPEAKER_03]: the perceived central nervous system
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that's one innovation I've seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, real quick, there was a client of
ours, and he'll be talking a little later
[SPEAKER_05]: on, who produced some THCP.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said he took it and he was high for
three days.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's called fun with chemistry.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, one thing real quick, and then I'll
kick it over to you guys and then we can
[SPEAKER_05]: kick it to the audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing about intellectual property in
the IP is if you really knew the GW Pharma
[SPEAKER_05]: Jazz deal, that was really done,
it wasn't done really on Epidiolex,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was done on the IP that GW Pharma Jazz
and GW Pharma had.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the biggest deal that's really
ever been done in the sector.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, if you look at GW,
it's more of a biotech company than a
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the importance of IP and innovation is
only going to grow in the sector for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think just to connect to the point
of Sebastian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we opened our industrial lab in Los
Angeles from Florence at the end of last
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started to interact a lot with
California companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's very interesting to
notice a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that many producers, they try to
stay secret about what they are doing in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of their process, their formulation,
because, as Sebastian was saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not easy to file a patent and remain
protected and fight for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fight for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know at least a couple of cases
where, actually, there has been a file,
[SPEAKER_00]: a patent that has been filed.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, one is in the production of
THCA diamonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the company was a small company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many others, they started to copy,
to copy the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the end, he couldn't do anything
else than being acquired by one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that was copying their method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And agree with their royalty or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has been clearly a defeat on that
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, it's interesting, the case of GW
and Canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been an IP lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably the end of the lawsuit was a
bit unexpected, perhaps, in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, it's certainly a
double-edged sword, the IP protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on our end, we believe that patent
protection and innovation and patent
[SPEAKER_00]: protection is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we filed five different patent
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them, they have been already
granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because our model is also based on
licensing this technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, as in every sector,
filing a patent is not sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to protect by executing,
through the execution, and deliver the
[SPEAKER_00]: best service or the best product on the
market, in any case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the IP protection, I believe,
is just a plus.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anything else?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, nothing to add on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Guy, we can put it out to the audience
for any questions we may have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, it was hard for me even to take
notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because things that you folks seem to
assume is so far over my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the United States recently,
as you know, the DEA has granted licenses
[SPEAKER_04]: to a number of cannabis cultivators who
are meant to supply product in competition
[SPEAKER_04]: with the much maligned University of
Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am curious if anyone on the panel
has a sense of how those business models
[SPEAKER_04]: what kind of business models might develop
by having well funded, DEA approved,
[SPEAKER_04]: presumably well regulated, new suppliers
of cannabis and cannabinoids into the
[SPEAKER_04]: research space and into pharma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this a big deal or is it just TBC?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want me to have a go at that?
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a big deal because it shows intent
federally that they want to develop
[SPEAKER_07]: research.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that possibly then opens up grant
funding in America, which is still the
[SPEAKER_07]: biggest grant funding capability in the
world.
[SPEAKER_07]: So from a research perspective,
I think it's fantastic news.
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, Mississippi cannabis was
dust that was off the floor, I think,
[SPEAKER_07]: in Mississippi somewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: So fantastic on that front.
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of really getting to the
molecular level of the issue, I think it
[SPEAKER_07]: provides a generic starting point for
questions that are molecular questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not necessarily biomass or whole flour
questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it therefore has a certain limited
potential if it's just one strain of
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis grown to order through a certain
federally licensed site.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are much more excited about
organizations that can grow small batches
[SPEAKER_07]: of material where you can still do pilot
studies.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're fundamentally thinking about
the chemistry and the variable chemistry,
[SPEAKER_07]: possibly in polychemical format,
not down to THCB, but maybe it's unique
[SPEAKER_07]: land race strains or other things that are
producing really interesting things that
[SPEAKER_07]: we don't see regularly.
[SPEAKER_07]: That has huge potential to be far more
impactful over time than just a generic
[SPEAKER_07]: centralized source of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a great start for helping the
industry get started.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the Cabell side, yes, it's a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you look at, we know a number
of these companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sue Sisley, who I've known forever,
she has a DA license in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's doing some interesting things.
[SPEAKER_05]: It also helps on the psychedelic side,
but we've talked before.
[SPEAKER_05]: You heard me earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: The pharma companies really are not the
source of innovation anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's biotech companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that has lowered in the US,
which is really still the hub of biotech
[SPEAKER_05]: in the world, has lowered the activation
energy to get to market.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, the reason why it's a big
deal, BRC, biotech research company,
[SPEAKER_05]: has a DA license in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hunter Land, who's a friend of mine,
is a head science guy there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They raised 20 million, I think,
intrinsic lab or intrinsic partners led
[SPEAKER_05]: that round.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the 20 million bucks is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you look at another one of the
companies that owns a DA license is Bright
[SPEAKER_05]: Green.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're public on the NASDAQ.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as far as capital, yes, it makes a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for a fascinating conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was particularly interested in the data
science aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about actually clinical trials,
these past couple of years, I had some
[SPEAKER_01]: experience doing clinical trials in
cannabis from my PhD research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I'm sure you know, stigma still
exists in senior scientific boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the INCB, it's still an uncertain
regulatory landscape for a lot of pharma
[SPEAKER_01]: companies to invest in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to ask, what do you think of
real world data as an alternative to
[SPEAKER_01]: formal clinical research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a valid way around the problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a follow-up question, if so,
what kind of data should we be collecting?
[SPEAKER_01]: What variables are most important to
gather from the real world use of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, both medical use or otherwise?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are not, as a company, involved in
the clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are collecting and collaborating
with companies that are using our
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction system to produce compounds
which can then be used in clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a comment that I would like to make is
that some months ago there was a research
[SPEAKER_00]: study that hits the news saying that most
of the clinical trials were inconclusive
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding the utilization of cannabinoids
for a number of pathologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took a bit of time internally to
review these research studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: mental studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we found out, I mean,
not being, again, a company specializing
[SPEAKER_00]: in this field, but what we found out is
that there was a very interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: correlation let's say between the studies
that found cannabinoids to be effective
[SPEAKER_00]: with the administration method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to say is that apparently
the inhalation is way more effective than
[SPEAKER_00]: other ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that aspect for cannabis,
again, I'm not a doctor, I'm not a
[SPEAKER_00]: physician, but that's what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we reviewed the 2030 studies that were
considered in that meta-analysis and
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly there was a strong correlation
between the inhalation and the
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness of the treatment.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the challenge is that the
retrospective work where you have no
[SPEAKER_07]: handle at all on what the user is taking
and possibly getting a beneficial
[SPEAKER_07]: therapeutic effect is quite limited.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're about to run a pilot actually in
a cohort of chronic inflammatory disorder.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't tell you what it is, but it's a
chronic inflammation where we are going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be working with a major university in the
UK to collect the material they're
[SPEAKER_07]: actually using alongside collecting the,
if you like, the clinical data or the
[SPEAKER_07]: questionnaire feedback to do the chemical
analyses of the material they're using and
[SPEAKER_07]: then using data science to your point to
be able to look for signals in those data.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it has huge potential.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been doing it for a decade.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called ethnobotany.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've just been doing it in the Peruvian
jungles and places like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But hey, it's time for us to bring it into
the Western world and start doing it here
[SPEAKER_07]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a point counterpoint on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming if you're talking real-world
data, you're talking non-clinical trials
[SPEAKER_05]: that are out, kind of like a phase four
trial.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more data we have, the better it is to
get rid of the stigma.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the negative side, we know a group that
was asked by Mitch McConnell and the FDA
[SPEAKER_05]: to evaluate CBD and CBD toxicity with a
range of different products in the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they came up with some really
interesting findings, one of them being
[SPEAKER_05]: that CBD is not that dangerous and
actually had beneficial effects on
[SPEAKER_05]: diabetes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they sent that into the FDA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what the FDA did?
[SPEAKER_05]: They buried it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So frankly speaking, our thought is if you
really want to do real science on cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: and cannabinoids, go to Australia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do it in Israel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do it in the US, because I think the
FDA right now is abdicating their
[SPEAKER_05]: leadership in the role, if you really want
to know my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sita Schubert, European Medicinal Cannabis
Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the point is to look for
opportunities in science is not so
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the allowance of the German law,
Bee Farm, who is known as one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: strictest rapporteurs in any kind of
registration process, already made an
[SPEAKER_02]: allowance for 44 indications to get it on
a special permission imported.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the roadmap where to go is
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what we are missing as a cannabis
industry is to understand ourselves as
[SPEAKER_02]: part of the pharmaceutical industry and to
figure out the regulatory path and the
[SPEAKER_02]: dosage finding, because I think this is
where we are lacking data due to the
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here I think there will be no
avoidance of coalition in somebody who is
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing the regulatory path and the
clinical trial path.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the 44 indications are unmet
medical need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything what you can provide in this
area will be more than welcome by the EMA,
[SPEAKER_02]: by Bee Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not Bee Farm, because they're all
strict.
[SPEAKER_02]: Conditions, you go to the EMA,
and you get 26 markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's not as difficult as we
might think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I agree fundamentally with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's challenging when that process
already exists.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's how pharmaceuticals are developed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're saying the same thing,
and I agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it is a problem when we just
decide that cannabis is going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: relevant to x number of conditions,
because we kind of like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not a very scientific process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would suggest that we need to be a
little bit more open-minded in
[SPEAKER_07]: understanding the fundamentals of how the
biochemistry and the pharmacokinetics of
[SPEAKER_07]: the molecules work, which we still don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we just go and put a blanket,
those 44 other ones don't think about
[SPEAKER_07]: anything else, because you might
fundamentally be missing an enormous
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunity left field, which you just
don't look at.
[SPEAKER_06]: It works.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does work.
[SPEAKER_06]: A number of questions were asked in
previous panelists of what's the most
[SPEAKER_06]: important thing that could be done for the
cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think you guys sitting up there,
you've nailed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, it's the science that increases
the knowledge that reduces the stigma.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question is this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the stigma still going to be here in
four years' time?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you think the actions that you're
taking now will have removed that stigma
[SPEAKER_06]: within that four years?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if not, how can we improve the removal
of stigma so that it is gone in four
[SPEAKER_06]: years?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say real quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, just two examples.
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on geography, John.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you look at Malaysia,
and anybody, especially Australia,
[SPEAKER_05]: knows about Malaysia, they have capital
punishment for anybody with any amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, any drug, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the fact here, if you're in Germany and
you go to Bavaria, Bavaria's still not
[SPEAKER_05]: very keen on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the stigma and how long it
lasts is going to be geographically
[SPEAKER_05]: determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have, maybe wrongfully, but I have
big hope in the completion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment in the US at the base of the
eventual decision for rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that if the final outcome
that is supposed to happen by the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year is going to provide the basis for
an effective, for real rescheduling,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say above plus three, I expect that
to have a big impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the end, at least on the
Western world, the influence of the US in
[SPEAKER_00]: many manner, the same manner that the
provision has been kind of exported,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe that the same type of
opposite trend can occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really hope that this assessment is
sufficiently clear to provide the basis
[SPEAKER_00]: for the DEA to reschedule cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that as a major milestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that will not occur, I think many other
countries like, I'm talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance, Italy, we are really far
from eliminating the stigma, but really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stigma is also present still in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a local team there,
and some managers, even in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are avoiding to mention what their
job is when they go to the school.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the situation in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Europe and Italy, it's not possible
in four years, I see.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can add a comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I work in Europe's third largest
chemical park, which is Hoekst.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can tell you that many of the
world's top custom chemical manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_03]: and for example, one of them, a
pharmaceutical company Sanofi,
[SPEAKER_03]: divested their fine chemicals production
to a company they call Euro Appy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Euro Appy are my neighbors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was speaking with them about doing
some work on some cannabinoids that's
[SPEAKER_03]: perfectly regulatory compliant,
but they still feel a stigma with these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the answers that they gave me
one time as well, they had just gone
[SPEAKER_03]: public, been listed on the German Stock
Exchange, and they thought they didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to have anything to do with any
chemistry that touched upon cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that includes even CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't want to do anything with CBD
because there's still that stigma
[SPEAKER_03]: involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can say that large German chemical
manufacturers, at least, there's still too
[SPEAKER_03]: much of a stigma involved for them to
become involved with these types of
compounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I respond to your question before you
ask another one, just really quickly?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think anything that verges on a
religious experience or a mystical
[SPEAKER_07]: experience, which cannabinoids,
psychedelics may do, is always going to
[SPEAKER_07]: have a stigma associated with it with
those who are looking to control the
[SPEAKER_07]: populace.
[SPEAKER_07]: And therefore, I think education of
yourself so that you understand how to use
[SPEAKER_07]: that medicine beyond the medical
practitioner is going to be a big part of
[SPEAKER_07]: how actually this becomes destigmatized
and repatriated into the hands of the
[SPEAKER_07]: people who can treat themselves with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well put, well put, Sebastian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one point or more.
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned... Sorry, can you hear me
now?
[SPEAKER_06]: So one point more.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in Singapore last week.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking at doing research there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was in Malaysia.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking at doing research there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these Asian countries are moving along
despite them hanging somebody in Singapore
[SPEAKER_06]: six weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all already operate in five countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So USA, Canada, UK, Germany, Australia,
and funny enough, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the biggest problem we face around the
world is stigma.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have nailed it, but we have to
actually work together to overcome that
[SPEAKER_06]: stigma.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one thing I think out of this
whole forum that we need to actually
[SPEAKER_06]: grasp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Overcome the stigma.
[SPEAKER_06]: The rest of it will follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it for the panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
