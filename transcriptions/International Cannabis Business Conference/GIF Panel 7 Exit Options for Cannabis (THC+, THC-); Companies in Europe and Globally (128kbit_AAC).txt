[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all for joining us here,
Global Investor Forum.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about some interesting
stuff about exit options.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about the picks and
shovels.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Alex Revich.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been coming here since 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: So amazing to see all these people here
and watching Berlin grow to what it is
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been doing this now for almost 10
years in the legal industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I have an Edibles contract
manufacturer in Canada and a pharmacy
[SPEAKER_03]: called Hybrid Farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to let my awesome panelists
introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Phil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Philipp.
[SPEAKER_06]: I work for Kanturaj.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not my first rodeo on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I started the cannabis industry in 2017.
[SPEAKER_06]: I joined Pedanius, which was the first
cannabis wholesale in Europe, which was
[SPEAKER_06]: later acquired by Aurora.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I became the managing director for
Aurora Europe and built a European
[SPEAKER_06]: platform for Aurora.
[SPEAKER_06]: As we all know, Aurora had a quite unique
operating model, vertically integrated
[SPEAKER_06]: from sea to sail.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then with Kanturaj, we came up with a
new operating model, which is,
[SPEAKER_06]: at least to me, quite unique.
[SPEAKER_06]: It allows us to partner with any legal
grower worldwide, bring their cannabis to
[SPEAKER_06]: Germany, manufactured here according to
EUGMP, and then sell it all over Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: As of today, we've signed long-term
agreements with more than 50 cultivators
[SPEAKER_06]: from 18 countries and brought cannabis
flowers from Jamaica, Uganda, Uruguay,
[SPEAKER_06]: Portugal, Spain, into German and UK
pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's quite unique.
[SPEAKER_06]: It definitely improved, at least from our
perspective, the quality of flower
[SPEAKER_06]: currently available in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also shows in our development.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went public last year in November.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so far, we've been growing steadily.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're one of the few companies,
I think, in Europe, but also worldwide,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's actually already profitable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So very happy to talk about Kanturaj
today, but also any types of questions
[SPEAKER_06]: you'll throw at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kia ora, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Carmen Doran.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the CEO of Helios Therapeutics,
which is New Zealand's largest producer of
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Helios is a medicines company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We exist to improve the quality of life of
those underserved by conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are vertically integrated, EUGMP end to
end, as well as GACP.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit about our journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Helios was first founded in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: We entered the New Zealand market back in
2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year, we brought New Zealand
grown, New Zealand made medicines to our
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiwi patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us now, the next step is bringing
those New Zealand grown, New Zealand made
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines to the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And happy to be here and talking to people
about that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: From an investment story perspective,
we are 100% New Zealand owned currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had $60 million invested into
Helios, $60 million New Zealand dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is around 40 million euros,
all through private investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So individuals who are very passionate
about the health journey of our patients
[SPEAKER_00]: in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have high expectations, but they also
understand the long game around making
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's a really
interesting point that I can bring to the
[SPEAKER_00]: panel today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought 20 IMs with me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all sitting out on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two left.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means there's 18 people out there
thinking about investing in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are at the moment taking expressions of
interest for a capital raise later in the
[SPEAKER_00]: year of $5 million New Zealand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing, if anyone really
loves New Zealand and wants to come and
[SPEAKER_00]: live there, is if you invest $5 million
into Helios, the New Zealand government
[SPEAKER_00]: will give you a visa and you can come and
live in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see you all soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're looking to escape your
country, you know exactly where to go.
Luke?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a visa or a passport, too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a visa to start with, but we'll see
what we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come see Carmen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first of all, it's an absolute
pleasure to be on stage with you,
[SPEAKER_01]: gentlemen, lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luke Richner is my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the co-founder and CEO of a tech
company in this space called CannaVigia,
[SPEAKER_01]: where we looked at the global supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We identified a couple of issues that are
lack of harmonization, standardization,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the sexy things in the back end
that everybody loves thinking about and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting in the center and found kind of a
common denominator there, understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: that not everything the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: does works on a global scale and created a
software from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fast forward today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, by coincidence, 18 countries,
as of next week, actually 19.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not the same countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our main, hate the term,
clade to fame, but we have a 10-year
[SPEAKER_01]: contract with the Swiss Health Ministry
for all the pilot projects, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: exemption status towards a single
convention in the U.N.
[SPEAKER_01]: that allows for a slow approach towards
legalization, the same way Germany is
[SPEAKER_01]: going with model projects and Holland is
going that direction, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fun fact, we're also doing a round
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody has any questions
afterwards, no brokers, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very, very happy to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, quick round of applause for our
panelists up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great group.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're going to start with
talking about the exit part of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is one panelist here that,
quote unquote, exited.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, people don't understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exiting is not like, OK, hey, thank you
very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a bunch of money and I can just go
hang out on a beach and just sip
[SPEAKER_03]: margaritas.
[SPEAKER_03]: That gentleman is right here to my left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Philip, they went public recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people look at that as an exit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you quickly talk about kind of the
process there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And does it feel like an exit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm going to guess it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talk about Toboro.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it doesn't feel like an exit,
but it was never meant to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end of the day, I just mentioned
the first company I worked for was
[SPEAKER_06]: acquired by Aurora.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a proper exit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you had lots and lots of cooks in
the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_06]: This time around, we wanted to stay in the
driver's seat.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the founders and the management team,
we still own more than 75% of the company,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is also a testament of what we did
before.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we raised less than $5 million in order
to come to a market cap as of today of
[SPEAKER_06]: roughly $130.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we believe in being a bootstrap
company.
[SPEAKER_06]: We believe in profitable growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we thought being at the capital market
gives us ample opportunity to raise money
[SPEAKER_06]: quickly if it's needed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there is an exciting opportunity,
and nothing against you guys, but talking
[SPEAKER_06]: to investors for three to six months,
doing due diligence after the other,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe the opportunity is gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Given it's highly dynamic, it's a really
innovative market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if a new market opens up, I want to be
in there and make some money.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we thought it's good to have that
additional opportunity to also raise money
[SPEAKER_06]: via the capital markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also wanted to give retail
investors especially in Germany,
[SPEAKER_06]: the chance to invest into a company rather
early.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we also tap into that retail investor
potential here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lots and lots of pent up demand.
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw that after our listing,
the price went up and it stayed up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not like in the US and Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's definitely a high demand by
investors in Germany, but maybe all over
[SPEAKER_06]: Europe to invest into a company quite
early on.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the ones giving them also the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a key thing to bring up is that
when you're investing in these types of
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses, you're investing in a
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, coming from Canada, people were
investing in dreams and stories and hopes,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're raising hundreds of millions
of dollars with companies that didn't even
[SPEAKER_03]: have a dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: All three of these people up here have
revenues, have market share, and now
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about getting some money,
it makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Carmen, you were saying people ask
you all the time, like, what's your exit
[SPEAKER_03]: plan?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what's it like getting asked that
all the time?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do you tell them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answer to that is we don't have a
short term exit plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not here to exit right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our investors that came on from the
beginning came on for the journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, in really challenging
capital markets last year, we made the
[SPEAKER_00]: decision to go out and diversify our
shareholder base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we added 18 new investors into our
portfolio last year, knowing that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to keep on this journey for a bit
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really is because we are a
medicines company, and to build value and
[SPEAKER_00]: IP in a medicines company does take time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a medicines company that grows
things from plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That also takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, to give us time to build that
value for our shareholders who have backed
[SPEAKER_00]: us all the way, that's why we look at a
longer term plan before we start talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about exits.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Luke, we were talking backstage about
some of these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some thoughts you have on exit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'd really like to please share
with the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in general, I think the overall
landscape has changed dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while the early days of this industry
was built on dreams and storylines and,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, press releases and events
where people scratched their backs and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of built, let's call it, the US dream
or Canadian or whatever you want to call
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, capital markets have dried up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a different kind of appetite from
investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our strategy went from two years ago,
well, let's just Europe, Africa,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Asia is where we're focused on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where my network's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is where we're very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sell to whoever makes the race in
the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they go federal, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we pivoted to a quick focus on
breakeven.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been self-funded so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did see a need for quick capital,
as you said before, when Germany went
[SPEAKER_01]: model project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suddenly, we were the only software
provider in the world that actually has
[SPEAKER_01]: done this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our reporting goes to the Swiss Health
Ministry, to the UN, so we know what they
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then overnight, we're like,
OK, oh, shit, this is now, we need cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been three months of the most
beautiful times of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great food, great drinks, amazing people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could have definitely done a lot
more value for my company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pivot from sell the dream to make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you have the trajectory to making
it happen, there's a lot to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, if you have the luxury,
pick and choose who you bring on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, somebody that can throw in cash
again and again when it's needed,
[SPEAKER_01]: and fast, and stay close with whoever you
get behind you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, it's a constant shift with
a lot of different factors that determine
[SPEAKER_01]: an exit strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started talking about it with exit,
and we're going to get into some other
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one piece of advice, I remember
someone asked me, what's the number one
[SPEAKER_03]: piece of advice?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's so hard to say number one,
but really who you take money from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think all three of these people here
are talking about how important the right
[SPEAKER_03]: exit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're not in the right exit
situation, make sure you're taking money
[SPEAKER_03]: from the right situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But enough about exiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about entering.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about the entering the
market, the picks and shovels,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're going to open up to some
questions now.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're talking about entering the
market, one thing that we were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about is how do we build value in the
business through brand reputation and IP?
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we're exiting, let's talk about
entering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Carmen, maybe you want to start us off
with that, and we can just talk about how
[SPEAKER_03]: do you build value in this business so we
can one day exit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think one of the key things
around building value in the business is
[SPEAKER_00]: going out there and doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were mentioning, Luke, about all the
press releases and all of the big fanfare
[SPEAKER_00]: about things, and we've all seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all seen a lot of publicity and big
fanfare around the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, I think it's really key to be
going out and delivering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting product to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always chose for us to deliver for Kiwi
patients first, delivering our home market
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very careful on what we promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that what we promise
we do deliver, and sometimes those things
[SPEAKER_00]: are outside of our control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do have some very honest
conversations with our partners,
[SPEAKER_00]: our distribution partners, with our
patients, with our shareholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that rather than trying to
sell the story, building the relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: is really important in how you build value
in the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part really around brand and IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a medicines market, that does take
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next steps for us are moving into a
clinical evidence base and clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: The great thing about a medicinal cannabis
scheme is you can put products into market
[SPEAKER_00]: and get feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's different from other medicines,
where you come up with an idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: you develop a product, and 10 years later,
once you've done clinical trials and
[SPEAKER_00]: invested all the money, you can put it
into market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually using that opportunity
to build value by learning about the
[SPEAKER_00]: markets and learning about the clinical
results of our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can build products in market,
which we can then feed back into our
[SPEAKER_00]: innovation and IP pipeline.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in general.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, just real quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of entering a market,
it's also how do you differentiate
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself?
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I mentioned it's not our first
rodeo with Contourage, as we firmly looked
[SPEAKER_06]: at the supply chain and asked,
so where is actually our core advantage?
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't be cultivation, because there's
so many excellent growers out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's rather about manufacturing or knowing
the regulatory framework in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we came up with the model.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's partner with the best growers out
there, get their product to Germany,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then we take care of the rest,
which is actually quite challenging,
[SPEAKER_06]: because the framework differs from Germany
to Poland to the UK.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's what we've been doing for the
last six, seven years.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't cultivate, but we did the rest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why we came up with the new
model, which was very unique when we
[SPEAKER_06]: launched it in 2021.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's part of a success story at the
end of the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs to be a differentiator.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're investing in people and their
experience and their ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: differentiate.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really good point, Luke.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you should never let somebody
else take a question when you actually had
[SPEAKER_01]: a great answer for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, the differentiating factor
also goes for investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your niche?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your added value?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you bring to the table for a
company?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at everybody right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end of the day, it goes,
yes, from our side, from the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to find our niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have to then be agile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely word.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of like pivot a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to do global supply chain
management, and now I have a software
[SPEAKER_01]: company, which works, luckily,
for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't be too agile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of try to stick within a bit of the
boundaries of what you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the same goes for investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just here is a million or 10 or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, a million or 10 is a lot of
money in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a lot of money in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: But find someone that can spend this
sensibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, and really, what is your added
value?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you bring them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you bring them network?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you bring them more capital down the
line?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you bring them advisory in which
direction?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that I think gets
lost on both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're here on one side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we're taking the side of the industry
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, what I'm looking for in an
investor, I want him to tell me,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, I'll bring you this, this,
this, and this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because just to get cash, yes,
of course, cash is king.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from our side, it is this universe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The USP, as you call it, goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what I've been missing in the
last three months of talking to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, what do you need more than
money?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called smart money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sticking with you, Luke, we had a
conversation recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know Luke doesn't take it the wrong
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about the not sexy part of this
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone wants to talk about all this
genetics and growing and the flower and
[SPEAKER_03]: all this fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But actually, the important part of
investing is making sure that the not sexy
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff is really taken care of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Luke, sorry to talk about software as
maybe not the sexiest thing, but it's so
[SPEAKER_03]: critical to all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're the first person, if you can
touch on certification and how software
[SPEAKER_03]: helps with it is so critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we were talking about backstage that
you can't even get insurance if you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: compliant and the software which helps you
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might not realize how important
something not so popular is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you might not even know about,
but it's critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't invest in businesses that don't
understand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe, Luke, if you can kind of start
us off with maybe not the sexiest topic
[SPEAKER_03]: from such a sexy gentleman like yourself,
but please go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sex is always relative.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end of the day, it lays in the eyes
of the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luke, yes, exactly, because everybody
loves those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants to be the superstar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end of the day, it's not the
superstar that makes the most money.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end of the day, maybe in sports it
is more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in industries that are developing,
if you, or let's go back to the non-sexy
[SPEAKER_01]: part.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I found, which is compliance and
transparency and standards and regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: framework, harmonization and all those
lovely subjects in the back end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a little detour there with the
insurance thing that you threw in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice to get 20 million to make
a facility and grow cannabis without
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody buying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point you have to sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point you have to ship it
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point you want it to be shipped
with insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because otherwise, if something happens,
and by chance, cannabis is proud to think
[SPEAKER_01]: that something is happening that are not
planned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to really factor in
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of companies that I spoke to on
four continents in 18 countries and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth that have raised, and I almost said
tons, lots of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go like, yeah, but why should I
pay for compliance?
[SPEAKER_01]: You do one wrong batch and you lose your
license and everything is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to really skimp out that
fraction of your investment on that one
[SPEAKER_01]: important part.
[SPEAKER_01]: That if you do it right, you go into a
bank with a de-risking kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: reporting and say, look here, give me
finance bits and pieces of my,
[SPEAKER_01]: be it letter of credits and the supply
chain and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can just go and raise money again
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's in everybody else's own interest
to see what they want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And insurance, at the end of the day,
which industry do you have shipments
[SPEAKER_01]: worth?
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of million dollars, depending on
the volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that you ship from, you said before,
Jamaica, Uganda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's throw Zimbabwe in there and then go
to insurance and say I want to ship
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis from these countries to where
we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really helps if you have a Swiss
software with a Swiss de-risking aspect
[SPEAKER_01]: that is accepted by the Swiss Health
Ministry for recreational, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: just adult use pilot projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but really, put some thought into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you bring into your production
flow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever supply chain to really let it
flow afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's usually the unsexy things.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, very good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other kind of picks and shovels or
auxiliary businesses that you want to just
[SPEAKER_03]: touch on that you think maybe is not as
popular or people are excited about but
[SPEAKER_03]: are still so critical to your businesses?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know anything that you can think
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I can add an example there around
banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we changed our bank last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: To one that was going to better suit our
needs as we go into the next phase of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: To work with our new bank, the Bank of New
Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to change all of their policies
to be able to work with medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they chose to do it because it is a
new industry that they really support and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have high growth in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work with them as a really strong
partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they support us with our FX hedging,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also support us with capital
raising and introducing us to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: their high net worth individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They support us with their connections,
which then help with things like
[SPEAKER_00]: insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's a lot of things to
set behind from a partnership model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk partnerships in this
industry, we're often talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: physical partnerships, the movement of
goods and materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the partnerships on the services side
can really help move your business
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or make your life really, really hard as a
CEO if you have to spend a lot of time
[SPEAKER_00]: managing that partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that your customers don't
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that your investors don't
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually you can't run a business
without some of those service providers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it is software, banking,
insurance, logistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those pieces have to work to be
able to deliver.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really happy you actually touched
on it because we want to talk about the
[SPEAKER_03]: elephant in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: That this morning I heard a lot of
frustration around a lot of different
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the elephant in the room is the
challenges of actually getting the money
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we were talking backstage about
the importance of being even keel and
[SPEAKER_03]: profitable rather than being at the mercy
of investors.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of importance about being
nimble and the ability to pivot is so
[SPEAKER_03]: critical in an emerging market while we're
pioneering this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question that we have is,
what are the key focus areas in
[SPEAKER_03]: challenging economic conditions when
capital is scarce?
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice if we just raised money
like we did in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what can you all maybe suggest?
[SPEAKER_03]: Until all the money is being thrown at
you, how do you survive long enough until
[SPEAKER_03]: you can make some money and potentially
exit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Luke, you look eager to jump in on this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we're in the tail end of the first
bust, the second one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the bell curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have M&A, which is all lovely
people coming in telling you what you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they tell you, drive you into the
ground and bring three companies together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're forgetting the company cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then M&A, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from an industry standpoint,
in those moments, partnerships go a long
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe try to understand, how can I add
value there?
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I really good at?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to do it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a big problem about the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants to do it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this vertically integrated model
worked wonders in New Zealand and worked
[SPEAKER_01]: wonders in Canada and the US, but it's not
really how the world works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, find your niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your actual USP?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you contract manufacturing,
contract farming?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find strong alliances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And capital is not going to be flowing in
bulk over the next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at least, that's what every economist
out there will tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every investor will tell you, no,
no, no, next year, next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a strategy behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, partnerships is my answer
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe cut the ego a bit back here and
find long-term alliances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And survival mode is, at the moment,
what I think is key for many industry
[SPEAKER_01]: players.
[SPEAKER_03]: Survival mode.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's definitely good advice,
Carmen and Philipp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, that's our operating model.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we believe in partnerships.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our cultivators, they are partners.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not suppliers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we basically work together to get the
best product available into any medical
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that goes a long way, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if something doesn't go according to
plan, it's still a partnership.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can work it out at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you talk about supply agreements,
suppliers, it's difficult if you're in a
[SPEAKER_06]: challenging situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, again, back in my Aurora days,
we had to do it all ourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: So nobody's an expert along the full
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Focus on what you do best.
[SPEAKER_06]: Provide a value add for your partners.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I think you're in a pretty good
position.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the end of the day, everybody wants
to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: But try to be profitable as quickly as
possible, because you're not at the mercy
[SPEAKER_06]: of investors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're, again, in a difficult
situation trying to raise money quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: We never wanted to be in that position.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why we're adamant on growing
profitably at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Carmen, it was awesome what you said
about the support from the bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was awesome hearing your story of
how the government is supporting you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in Canada, I can tell you that the
banks were very difficult, even were
[SPEAKER_03]: federally legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they give a hard time for cannabis
companies to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I was executive director of our
trade association, we met with the banking
[SPEAKER_03]: association.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said the number one concern from
the banks is they don't know who's legal
[SPEAKER_03]: and who's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, oh, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because here's a link to a website that
has a full list of who's legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can send you a copy of their
license.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not buying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's awesome that you're getting the
support of the bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any other kind of thoughts of
what people can do when the banks are
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe not so supportive?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everyone is as lucky to have the
support of the banks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_03]: But any kind of thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll take questions from the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so back to the support that we get
from the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big shout out to New Zealand Trade
and Enterprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they back there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out, New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That man over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to support your industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we come and raise money?
[SPEAKER_00]: So New Zealand Trade and Enterprise do
have an investment arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Helios has been certified under the
Active Investor Program, which is where I
[SPEAKER_00]: say you can get a visa if you come and
invest in Helios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in the other companies in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think our New Zealand eco structure
around supporting the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: we get a lot of support from the
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: NZTE is one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Callahan Innovation also support a lot of
our research and development frameworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Helios has just been named in the top
100 high growth companies for Callahan
[SPEAKER_00]: Innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's supporting things for us like
our breeding and genetics program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It supports some of our purification new
technologies that are coming online.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also supports our talent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have three PhD students who are
developing products who are funded,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly funded by the government in New
Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means that it's bringing our next
wave of products, but at the same time is
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing our next wave of talent into the
organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have to give a big shout out to
the ecosystem that we live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the point around what do you do in
these really challenging times?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then whether it's support from partners
like government or from your existing
[SPEAKER_00]: shareholders, that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would absolutely agree, get to break
even as fast as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on what gets you there so that
you're self-funding and you can invest
[SPEAKER_00]: then in the sexy and fun stuff yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also get the rewards as you
get to being investing in that sexy and
[SPEAKER_00]: fun stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to hear New Zealand is that
forward thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Germany is also, I know two
people in the room here who got 20% grants
[SPEAKER_01]: for their facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: R&D is usually something that is always
also very much supported.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get tax breaks, but you got to go
there and talk to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't come to you and just throw it
in your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland is where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nice programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe has Horizon 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of different kind of
approaches for let's call it alternative
[SPEAKER_01]: financing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the government's job that when
they have a business that is functioning
[SPEAKER_01]: and giving jobs to make sure that it kind
of doesn't go bust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't underestimate how much you can do
in that last stretch before you get
[SPEAKER_01]: completely desperate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you have to do it in
proactively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find someone that supports you either
internally or externally for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really important point is sometimes
you need the expert like consultants to
[SPEAKER_03]: help you apply for these grants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to knock on your door
and say, hey, can we give you some money?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you have to call them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to know what to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people who that's their job is to
know how to push those buttons to get
[SPEAKER_03]: those type of grants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they work with all other industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe they're not calling on you as a
cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might have to seek them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like something that Carmen also
said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we're talking more about investment
and money.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also investing in people and
education and all these other investments
[SPEAKER_03]: that might not turn into money the way
that, oh, we're going to build a million
[SPEAKER_03]: square foot facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to cost $50 million.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to invest in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you take a fraction of that,
invest in people, invest in research,
[SPEAKER_03]: invest in things that you're planting the
seeds now for an industry down the road,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can really reap those rewards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, shout out to New Zealand for
realizing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hope more governments kind of realize
that these things take time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to reap the benefits if
they actually do some investments now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, opening up to questions from the
audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it for the panel one more time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you always wait until I'm on this
side of the room?
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do it on purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prepare one over there after, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to keep you exercised.
[SPEAKER_05]: Often when private investors are
considering an entry into a new business
[SPEAKER_05]: or a grown business, the first question
that they ask themselves at entry is,
[SPEAKER_05]: how are we going to exit, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So in your experience, when you speak to
private investors, what type of exit
[SPEAKER_05]: options are they discussing?
[SPEAKER_05]: And what type of exit options are you
seeing for yourselves and for them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it trade sales?
[SPEAKER_05]: Trade sales to whom?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it IPOs?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then how do you think in terms of how
big you need to grow to be IPO ready
[SPEAKER_05]: within some foreseeable future timeline?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it is rather than a question that
we get asked by our investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a question we ask our potential
investors what their goals are around the
[SPEAKER_00]: investment so that we start off on that
same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really helps us to understand
what they're looking for in terms of value
[SPEAKER_00]: in the business and those very early
conversations rather than getting all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way down the courting process and then
realising that you have different
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations around timing and exits.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us at Helios, we've gone through
probably all of the different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't landed on which one is the
right one for us because I think it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: depend on the conditions at the time as to
whether it could be a trade sale or an
[SPEAKER_00]: IPO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really will depend on the value that
we build in the business over the next
[SPEAKER_00]: three to five years and also what the
international market looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Zealand is quite a small place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have five million people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three publicly listed cannabis
companies in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think two of the three are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get to meet them over the next few
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are privately owned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see both those business models
playing out in the New Zealand market and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see how that progresses and what we
can learn from that as we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another question for Carmen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great conversation so far, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Carmen, I had the pleasure of getting
to connect with you before the conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that I was really
impressed with was your true
[SPEAKER_02]: patient-centric approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you told me that the market is growing
really quickly in New Zealand because
[SPEAKER_02]: stigma is dissolving more quickly than you
expected it to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was wondering if you could talk a
little bit about why you think stigma is
[SPEAKER_02]: dissolving and perception is changing and
what you and your other companies have
[SPEAKER_02]: done to help support that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my favourite thing about being CEO of a
medicinal cannabis company is the emails I
[SPEAKER_00]: get back from patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've worked in medicines most of my
life, but I've never actually had those
[SPEAKER_00]: emails from patients to tell me good news
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally you just hear from patients when
something has gone wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a really powerful thing
that when patients are able to access
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal cannabis and get life-changing
experiences, they actually go and seek
[SPEAKER_00]: out, they seek out my email to tell me
that and to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also tell their friends,
whether it's over coffee or over the back
[SPEAKER_00]: garden fence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of our demand in New Zealand is
patient-driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: In New Zealand, any doctor can prescribe
medicinal cannabis for any condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's for CBD and for THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our doctors are learning about
medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, they're referring people to
specialist clinics, which are also
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the key thing is the
openness to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And myself, plus the other medicinal
cannabis companies that are here from New
[SPEAKER_00]: Zealand, we've all just come from a GP
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two each year, and we all have a
presence there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year there was a two-hour plenary
session at that GP conference around
[SPEAKER_00]: education around medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those environments and being there and
working with doctors, learning from
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors what other tools they want in
their toolkit, what other dosage forms
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to be able to deliver for their
patients is a very, very big part of our
[SPEAKER_00]: ethos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being able to deliver for our
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in terms of how quickly things are
growing, in 2022 there was 60,000 patients
[SPEAKER_00]: in New Zealand that doubled from the
previous year where we had 30,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought it was gonna double again
this year in 2023, but it's growing way
[SPEAKER_00]: faster than we thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that that's a really
exciting thing for companies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: setting up in New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go back two years, I thought the only
way that Helios or other medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis companies in New Zealand could
survive was all about exports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our New Zealand market has grown quickly,
and that's really supporting us to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to the point where we can export.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being able to deliver in our local
market is really helping the relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: we have with our export and distribution
partners, because they know that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to consistently deliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lots of great things around
this story for our patients that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: delivering for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also for our shareholders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like you almost have as many
patients as Canada you're going towards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually a very important point,
and I've mentioned this to some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: people in the room, have a domestic market
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so tired of all these industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we're gonna grow, but only for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want it for our people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's so important to have cannabis
for your people and then worry about
[SPEAKER_03]: export and not make the mistake of like
Denmark or others.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you have another thought?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're lucky and you do have a domestic
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So talking about our partners in Uganda,
for example, there is no local and
[SPEAKER_06]: domestic market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still they grow very good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you partner with us, you can bring
it into Europe and start building your
[SPEAKER_06]: business and waiting for the domestic
market to actually open up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're excellent growers out there,
but they don't have a domestic market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they need to venture out and go
international.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then they need to be wise about whom
to partner with in order to do it
[SPEAKER_06]: cost-efficient and get in the right types
of market where you can actually make some
[SPEAKER_06]: money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe they should lobby their
government and say, hey, we're doing this
[SPEAKER_03]: in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at all these customers in Germany
having an awesome experience with our
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we should have some of our own
people have a good experience as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
