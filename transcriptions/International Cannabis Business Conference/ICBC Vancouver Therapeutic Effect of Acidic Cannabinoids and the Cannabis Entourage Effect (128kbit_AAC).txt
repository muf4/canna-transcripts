[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about therapeutic
potential of acidic cannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start out with this statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, that without cannabis plant
and the war on drugs, we would not know
[SPEAKER_01]: about endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the war on drugs and the idea of
sponsoring cannabis research that shows
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis is harmful led us to the
discovery of the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without war on drugs, we would not,
witness the end of cannabis prohibition
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was in a way a self-destructing war
on drugs that is now ending.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second statement, if it were not for
the endocannabinoid system, we would not
[SPEAKER_01]: be gathered here at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would not be interested in knowing the
relationship between our body and the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to move on to acidic
cannabinoids now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from Lithuania where we grow our
hemp, wild, organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where when I go, I like to pitch a tent
there for about two, three days and go
[SPEAKER_01]: nowhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: We inspect our plants here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is from about, I think three
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the beginning of September
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about four weeks ago, about three weeks
before we harvested those plants that were
[SPEAKER_01]: about 16 feet tall at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Kelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really interested in the
neuroprotective capabilities of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to know your thoughts on the
acidic or the natural versions of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they're more effective for
treating things like dementia and
[SPEAKER_00]: neurodegenerative diseases like
Alzheimer's?
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly, are there any trials going
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's lots of anecdotal evidence
about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to hear more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neuroprotective effects of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with the US government owning
the patent on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was neuroprotective.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is evidence mostly for neutral
cannabinoids, the THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is evidence in Alzheimer's disease,
reduction of beta amyloid plaques and
[SPEAKER_01]: senile plaques in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, it's in vitro studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have not been done in humans in
vivo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should look into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apart from one Parkinson's study in vitro,
there's nothing on acidic cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: that relates to neuroprotection.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we think of neuroprotection,
we have to think about things like
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the brain is on flames, things are
not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the brain is inflamed, it's
associated with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's associated with dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so controlling these processes that we
know controls inflammation is very likely
[SPEAKER_01]: is what's also contributing to
neuroprotection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if we look at human studies,
to my knowledge, they're very limited to
[SPEAKER_01]: survey studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just learned that I think Tildray is
doing a PTSD study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's also important to see
what results are going to come from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit of hand-waving about
neuroprotection.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't exactly know how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it controls the balance of
neuronal activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those could be the things that
contribute to neuroprotection.
