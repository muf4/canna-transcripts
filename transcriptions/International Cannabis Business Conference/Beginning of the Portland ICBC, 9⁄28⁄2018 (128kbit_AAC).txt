[SPEAKER_00]: How's everyone feeling?
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all feeling good this morning?
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm talking about,
Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really happy to have everyone here
today in Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do our conference all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the first B2B to go international,
and we started in Portland four years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember me and Anthony talking,
and we said, what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we said, we're going to start the
International Cannabis Business
[SPEAKER_03]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we going to start?
[SPEAKER_03]: We said, Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for a few years, we weren't
international.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just in Portland in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then eventually, we became
international.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Vancouver, if that counts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like international at half,
right, Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still in Cascadia, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then we went to Berlin,
and we rocked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We turned it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, our event in California is
the longest running in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: and now we've partnered with Hispanibus to
be in Barcelona also next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really excited about what we have
done in Oregon and what we are doing
[SPEAKER_03]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like to think that wherever we go in
the world, we bring a little piece of
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really important, because when
you go to Europe and they're growing all
[SPEAKER_03]: that shitty weed, and they just want to
make money, money, money, and you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, maybe you could grow organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe there's a product.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can bring a little of that Oregon
consciousness to the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not saying we're like all Mother
Teresa's here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you do leave Oregon and you talk
to people, like in Europe, and you talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about some hippie activism shit,
they look at you like you're an alien.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really important that we push
that narrative.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I tell people in Berlin,
hey Lee, Anthony, hey Lee, Anthony,
[SPEAKER_03]: please, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I tell people in Berlin, the first
thing I say to them is, as it's this
[SPEAKER_03]: nascent new market over there,
it's really crazy what's going on in
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say, hey, your bureaucrats and
politicians are going to fuck shit up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's important is that you have a
robust home garden and all criminal
[SPEAKER_03]: penalties are ended towards cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is really important,
because the industry will get messed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Oregon, smaller people have been pushed
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for better or mostly for worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is not what we ascribe to at the
ICBC.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think cannabis is an opportunity for
the world, not only for business,
[SPEAKER_03]: not only from human rights or civil
rights, but we think it can help end the
[SPEAKER_03]: industrial, some of the industrial
complexes in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just like my mentor, Jack Hare,
said, hemp can save the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to say it on Hate Ashbury,
you know, back in the day with my
[SPEAKER_03]: dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to have my signs and hemp can save
the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I barely believed it myself,
you know, but it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp can save the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we don't have a lot of hopeful
shit going on in this world these days,
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp is a great bright light.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to thank our sponsors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank Jefferson Packinghouse for that
great party last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to thank Oath.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a big party tonight with DJ
Mugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to thank Organic Alcohol Company,
the main sponsor.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of this could be possible without
those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's make a real quick clap for our
sponsors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Oath party is tonight at Spirit of
77.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget your pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's at Spirit of 77, right across by the
convention center.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got DJ Mugs from Cypress Hill there
tonight, DJ Nature, and it is going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: a hootenanny.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it starts at 9 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are feeding you all day today.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the expo room on the side there,
we have got beaucoup food.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're feeding you breakfast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're feeding you lunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got an ice cream social in the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can stay here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to go spend your money and
eat anyplace else if you don't want.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got you covered right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taco bar in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be off the chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to feed you and make sure
everyone's got all their energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our last Oregon show.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to just give a heartfelt thanks
to everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never say never, but we do not plan to do
another Oregon show for some years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is our 12th show in Oregon in
four years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like I said, we're not going to
be in Oregon anymore, but everything we do
[SPEAKER_03]: and how we go forth, we represent Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're trying to do is create
conduits so when we can finally export
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, I'll have created all these
awesome conduits around the world so we
[SPEAKER_03]: can sell all our Oregon weed to the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's only a matter of time, true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only a matter of time, and that's
really going to change the game up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're actually going to be talking
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a great program, but we'll be
delving into a lot of that, how Oregon can
[SPEAKER_03]: export and some of the pasta
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our WOVA app.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not on our WOVA app,
get on our WOVA app.
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes you communicate with all types
of people throughout the conference,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you get all our updates on little
announcements, contests, where the party
[SPEAKER_03]: is and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when lunch comes out and the ice cream
social and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get on WOVA.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have this slide up for
about 10 more seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anybody needs to get on WOVA,
just go down to registration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll sign you right on up,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys ready to get this thing
started?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys ready to get started?
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, we have such a great program for
you today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of amazing people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to kick it off really quick with
a person who's going to introduce our
[SPEAKER_03]: opening video.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a hero of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just told him a second ago,
I hate most politicians and I love you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is going on here?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because most politicians are politicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to be a politician because the
game is rigged, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: On a local level, we do have a few folks
that are consciously minded and
[SPEAKER_03]: revolutionary thinking and who actually
have some power and can get things done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our one big ally in this state is
Senator Floyd Przezanski.
[SPEAKER_03]: So without further ado, please make some
noise for our beloved Senator Floyd
[SPEAKER_03]: Przezanski.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, make some more noise for Floyd,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to thank all of you that are
here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also want to thank Alex for bringing
forward this conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been a trendsetter for the state and
as well as he said on an international
[SPEAKER_02]: level, without this type of discourse,
we would not be able to move forward as we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been my opportunity at this point
really to just take a few moments to
[SPEAKER_02]: introduce Jeff Merkley before we hear from
him on his video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I first met Jeff back in 1990.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1999, that is the year that he came into
office as a state representative
[SPEAKER_02]: representing part of Portland on the east
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, I got to, I guess,
get to know who he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2003, four years later, we had our
offices next to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: This allowed us to spend a lot of time
talking together, not only on the issues
[SPEAKER_02]: that were facing the state, but after
hours just sitting around and reflecting
[SPEAKER_02]: on where we were, what we wanted,
what were our values?
[SPEAKER_02]: How could we move Oregonians forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: How could we take care of many of the
issues that were facing us, including the
[SPEAKER_02]: economic depression and uncertainty in
many rural areas?
[SPEAKER_02]: He comes from a background of a rural
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Merle Creek, for those who do not know,
is in southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: His father was in the trades as a laborer
and they moved up to here in the Portland
[SPEAKER_02]: area where he finished his high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of those situations that when
we were sitting around and talking,
[SPEAKER_02]: I always found myself just being drawn in
by his thoughts, his visions of what he
[SPEAKER_02]: saw for the state and how he thought we
needed to move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of those situations that I
remember when he decided to run for U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Senate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually traveling back from Burns,
so I was on U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 and I got this phone call from Jeff and
Jeff says, hey, Floyd, what do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: about me running for U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Senate?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just kind of did a little bit on my
drive there going, whoa, that's a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: big step you're thinking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had just been elected and served as the
Speaker of the House.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had been the Democratic leader prior to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I know that he was getting his
message out and people were listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I told him, I said, if you really feel
that you have the ability to move forward
[SPEAKER_02]: at this time in your career to run for
that seat, I will support you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did go forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we all know, he won the Democratic
primary.
[SPEAKER_02]: That allowed him to go up against the
incumbent Gordon Smith.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a very close race, but Jeff
succeeded and he's been in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Senate since 2009.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's really important is seeing how he's
taken his visions for this state and has
[SPEAKER_02]: taken them and moved them into a much
larger, broader area for the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of those situations that I've
been very impressed to see how he's not
[SPEAKER_02]: been afraid to take very controversial
issues and put them out on the table for
[SPEAKER_02]: us to talk about and for others to listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of those situations that he
was the only senator to actually endorse
[SPEAKER_02]: Bernie Sanders for the primary in the
2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can only imagine being a senator
to take that type of step at that point in
[SPEAKER_02]: his career, what he was demarcating that
he was going for, who he thought was going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be the best individual to represent the
Democrats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the national election.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, earlier in that year,
he attempted, I should say earlier this
[SPEAKER_02]: year, he's attempted to enter into one of
the immigration detention centers.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is down in South Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those who have not met me,
that's my birth state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I heard that Jeff went down to
the Harlingen area, what he was attempting
[SPEAKER_02]: to do was to see how children of parents
who had been arrested trying to come into
[SPEAKER_02]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: seeking asylum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were being handled and how they were being
taken care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, ironically, they had placed them
into detention in a former Walmart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was denied access as a U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Senator to go in to check on the welfare
of these children.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, this made big news throughout
not only the nation, but also
[SPEAKER_02]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just showed once again where Jeff
was willing to take that step to bring and
[SPEAKER_02]: expose the needs of individuals that are
more disprivileged than he is and how he
[SPEAKER_02]: could, in fact, bring and shed the light
to make certain that they're being taken
[SPEAKER_02]: care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides that, we have seen even this week
where Jeff is actually was seeking an
[SPEAKER_02]: injunction to stop the confirmation of
Brent Kavanaugh because as he says,
[SPEAKER_02]: how can he as a U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Senator be able to vote on the floor for a
nominee without having all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: allegations that have been raised against
him being investigated through the FBI and
[SPEAKER_02]: then being able to have all of that out in
the open, be transparent and then make the
[SPEAKER_02]: decision as to whether or not that justice
should be elevated into the Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point, I think it's worth
noting before we hear from Jeff that in
[SPEAKER_02]: May of this year, he came forward to
co-sponsor Senator Cory Brooks Brokers
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana Justice Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would remove marijuana from the
federal list of controlled substances,
[SPEAKER_02]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_02]: making it legal throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's really important for us
to see again where Jeff has been willing
[SPEAKER_02]: to take that step to move forward to get
us as a nation to deal with issues that we
[SPEAKER_02]: should have dealt with back in 1971,
1972.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, let me just end with that he
has not only just been a co-sponsor of the
[SPEAKER_02]: legislation I just mentioned, but he's
also been active in trying to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: reform in the banking.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we all know, we need to open up the
banking both through financial
[SPEAKER_02]: institutions that include banks as well as
credit unions so we can in fact have the
[SPEAKER_02]: accountability.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a legislator, I'm very concerned that
we're not helping and facilitate so we can
[SPEAKER_02]: in fact make certain that there's
accountability and the reality,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a safety risk here.
[SPEAKER_02]: As many of you that are in the business,
to have that type of cash sitting around
[SPEAKER_02]: and not being able to actually do what
most businesses do that is to use a
[SPEAKER_02]: financial institution is wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's taken the lead there and I think
it's very important that we also
[SPEAKER_02]: acknowledge that he is also saying that VA
doctors should in fact have the ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually give counseling to vets in states
that actually have medical programs as to
[SPEAKER_02]: the benefit of medical marijuana for those
individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that gives you a little bit of
flavor of who Jeff Merkley is and I at
[SPEAKER_02]: this point want us to have an opportunity
to see where he's heading and what he
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to do for this industry and so we'll
have a few words from Jeff by video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Senator Jeff Merkley and welcome to
the International Cannabis Business
[SPEAKER_00]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: In state after state, the American people
have stood up to say that it's time to
[SPEAKER_00]: change cannabis laws in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why four years ago I was proud as
an Oregonian to support Major 91 and
[SPEAKER_00]: become the first United States Senator to
vote for legalizing cannabis in my home
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm working with my colleagues in
Washington to help make these changes at
[SPEAKER_00]: the national level because here's what we
know about the impact of legalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in the states that have done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: More jobs, more tax revenues, fewer
arrests, and a second chance for
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals convicted of minor drug
offenses who have had their records
[SPEAKER_00]: expunged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at the effect right here in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Fiscal Impact Committee originally
predicted that legalizing cannabis would
[SPEAKER_00]: generate between 17 and 40 million dollars
a year for the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the state is on track to double the
higher end of that projection and bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 80 million dollars a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% of that revenue goes right back into
our schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's roughly 34 million dollars for our
students and teachers.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% goes into mental health, alcoholism,
and drug services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another 12 to 13 million for the state
police and over 4 million for the Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: Health Authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Oregon isn't alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same kinds of benefits can be seen in
Colorado and in Washington State and in
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada, all of which have seen actual
revenue beat the initial estimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time has come for us to change the way
our country looks at and deals with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm working in Washington to make that
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've introduced the Safe Banking Act to
ensure that legitimate businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: following state cannabis laws have the
same access to resources and services that
[SPEAKER_00]: every other business has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too long ago, I went and saw for
myself how business owners, cut off from
[SPEAKER_00]: services and opportunities, have to pay
taxes, stuffing backpacks and duffel bags
[SPEAKER_00]: full of cash and driving hours to Salem to
deposit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no reason that if a state has
voted to legalize, business owners should
[SPEAKER_00]: have to operate in this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's burdensome and it's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Billions of dollars in cash is great for
organized crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for money laundering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for cheating on wages and
taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would all benefit by banking the
cannabis economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need to make sure that hemp
products with low THC are not regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: under the Controlled Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm proud that this change has been
included in the Senate Farm Bill this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we still need to get the Farm Bill
over the finish line, getting rid of this
[SPEAKER_00]: illogical restriction will help create
jobs and strengthen the agriculture sector
[SPEAKER_00]: across the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, I'm working with Senator
Booker on the Marijuana Justice Act to
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalize cannabis, stop racially
disproportionate enforcement of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: crimes, and give those convicted of past
use of possession crimes a clean slate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a co-sponsor of Senator Schumer's
Marijuana Freedom Opportunity Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would also decriminalize cannabis
throughout the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Times are changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The American people are demanding change
to how we treat cannabis across our
[SPEAKER_00]: nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know the benefits that legalizing
cannabis brings socially, economically,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in our justice system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm determined to help bring about
those changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thrilled to be working in
partnership with all of you to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's give a big thanks to Jared,
our signer here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more big thanks for Senator Merkley.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's make some noise and hope that he
runs for president, because I know I'd
[SPEAKER_03]: vote for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the ICBC, we like to bring a little
star power sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had many exciting guests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we have a very exciting guest who's
going to say a few words and introduce the
[SPEAKER_03]: head of the OLCC.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's so cool because usually our
big stars we've got to import from LA or
[SPEAKER_03]: someplace around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this big star lives right in Oregon,
in southern Oregon, and grows cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: and loves cannabis, and has a lot of
feelings towards cannabis, and hasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily been so outwardly vocal
waiting for the right time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today he's just going to say a couple
words about how he feels about our state
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis reform and opioid addiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So without further ado, please give a
warm, warm Oregon welcome to the one and
[SPEAKER_03]: only Mr. Jim Belushi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, make some noise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jim Belushi in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here because of the free taco bar
this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understood that it was going to be this
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you announced that they moved it
to the afternoon, I'm a little
[SPEAKER_01]: disappointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me get over that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love tacos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do live in Los Angeles, by the way,
Alex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a beautiful little farm on the
Rogue River in Eagle Park.
[SPEAKER_01]: Point in southern Oregon, right in the
middle of the Banana Belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a small, beautiful grow there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have become so intimate with this
plant by growing it, cultivating it,
[SPEAKER_01]: curing it, cutting it, selling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just brought me closer and closer to
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's brought me closer and closer to
the miracles and the spirit of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe cannabis, I wrote it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe the wellness of cannabis
includes helping to heal Alzheimer's,
[SPEAKER_01]: back pain, headaches, anxiety,
seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wellness of cannabis also includes the
enhancement of Crate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The creativity, the spark in the spirit,
the enhancement of the sounds of music,
[SPEAKER_01]: the taste of foods, the touch of your
lover's skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also includes euphoria, joyfulness,
higher consciousness.
[SPEAKER_01]: All this is the wellness of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am getting closer and closer to all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been educated here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon is a great state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is the great state of cannabis,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Oregon is going to lead this
country in the great quality and the great
[SPEAKER_01]: science that they produce here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've visited with Philos and all the
different scientists here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just remarkable what they're doing
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just overwhelmed by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more I get into it, the more I realize
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a wonderful plant to be engaged
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just changing my life personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an experience last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I visited over, I don't know, maybe 20,
25 dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were waiting in line to come in
and take a photograph and try out the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that we produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I met a veteran who was shaking a
little bit and staring at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he walked up to me and he said,
you know, I was a medic in Iraq.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw things that happened to the
human body that nobody should ever see in
[SPEAKER_01]: their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, my PTSD is so bad that I have
three kids that I have trouble relating
[SPEAKER_01]: to, a wife, and I can't sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, you're black diamond OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only strain that I have found
where I can talk to my children.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, like, had tears in his eyes and he
hugged me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went, I didn't make this stuff,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been here for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, you know, I just planted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, he goes, you are the steward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went, wow, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all are stewards of this medicine
to heal our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one fear in life is death.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number two fear in life is the
collapse of family.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the number two fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether a family falls apart from divorce,
disease, PTSD, addiction, a death in the
[SPEAKER_01]: family creates trauma.
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% of the families that experience this
kind of disease or trouble don't succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The families collapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that this medicine is going
to help our community and help our
[SPEAKER_01]: families get back and not collapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a woman whose son had 40
seizures a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said he would drop like he'd cut a
string on a marionette.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was in that bedroom with that boy
every night, never sleeping with her
[SPEAKER_01]: husband because of the care for this
child.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was in hospice taking all kinds of
drugs and she used some CBD oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: changed this kid's life, changed the
family's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That family almost blew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just love what the steward,
I'm proud to be a steward and I'm proud of
[SPEAKER_01]: all you for being a steward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keeping this going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I believe that, I believe if we
knew what we know now about cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 70s, if we knew what it was capable
of, if we knew it was medicine instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: a drug, there'd be a lot more people alive
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is not a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a gateway to healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gateway to medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gateway to spirituality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud to be in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have gotten to know a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our next speaker I've gotten to know
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty well, he's more than a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an acquaintance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I wasn't joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been in a relationship with him
because we've been discussing it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to get done.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of little things going on,
but we've been discussing an opiate trade
[SPEAKER_01]: program to begin here in Portland where we
can get free marijuana to the veterans,
[SPEAKER_01]: people on the street, people who have
opiate addictions, prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that every farmer and every
manufacturer in Oregon will be glad to
[SPEAKER_01]: donate anything to this program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve is a very smart man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have found that the OLCC is my partner,
is my friend, and I'm grateful that they
[SPEAKER_01]: gave me a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am their partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are my partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm proud to know this man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud to know all the people who work
for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Steve isn't really that good or
that smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really everyone that works for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these guys are really stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few of them standing back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wave your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always in the office.
Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them a hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make Steve look great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he is doing everything he can to make
cannabis work in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day finding solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day running into more problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding solutions and fighting and not
giving up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is our director.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is our steward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am proud to introduce the director
of the OLCC, Steve Marks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tacos are going to be early in the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be right back.
