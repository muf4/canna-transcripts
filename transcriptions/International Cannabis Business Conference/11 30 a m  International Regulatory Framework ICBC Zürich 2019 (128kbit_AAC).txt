[SPEAKER_03]: My first guest is Garrett Bain from Gene
Kanna.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Garrett.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see you again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We already had a panel in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Garrett is a cannabis, a hemp farmer
from Kentucky, from Kentucky, USA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you are chief sales officer of Gene
Kanna, and you have 15 years of experience
[SPEAKER_03]: in marketing, technology, sales and
management.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have managed business segments across
multiple customer channels with proven
[SPEAKER_03]: record of exceeding multi-million dollar
goals while expanding new businesses,
[SPEAKER_03]: lines and profile opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who sent that, but yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it comes to regulation,
we're talking when it comes to cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation and we talk in regulatory
frameworks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about a lot of frameworks,
keywords, MRA, GMP, GPP, JAPC,
[SPEAKER_03]: novel food regulation, and so on and so
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're producing hemp in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: The USA does not yet have a similar
regulation framework like Canada or the
[SPEAKER_03]: European community has.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And in which way does that affect your,
especially your international business
[SPEAKER_03]: connections?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So currently the foundation of the US
market started with some legislation
[SPEAKER_04]: around hemp farming as a, as a crop,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we see today under the US
under the farm bill that recently passed
[SPEAKER_04]: legalizing hemp as a, as a crop in the
United States federally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you still have state by state
considerations and state by state
[SPEAKER_04]: legislation that needs to potentially
align certain states with the federal
[SPEAKER_04]: legislation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some states have done a really good job of
that, Kentucky being one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have done a great job of putting
into putting a framework together within
[SPEAKER_04]: the state that compliments the federal
legislation, which has enabled a very
[SPEAKER_04]: successful hemp program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe the model that will be
rolled out across the entire United States
[SPEAKER_04]: at some point as, as the latent states,
the states that have not come on so
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly realize the economic opportunity
for the farmers and for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_04]: tangent businesses are not developing as
quickly in their states.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to look to other states that
have been successful and copy that model.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think from a legislative perspective,
the US has done a good job of paving the
[SPEAKER_04]: way for the crop as an agricultural
commodity.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're waiting on is the FDA to weigh
in on what is hemp derived CBD and
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a food?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it as nutritional supplement or is it a
drug or pharmaceutical?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is a meeting at the end of May.
[SPEAKER_04]: The FDA is hosting a public comment and
Jen Kenna will be participating as well as
[SPEAKER_04]: the US hemp round table to provide public
comment on where this fits into the
[SPEAKER_04]: economy, how it helps farmers and folks
that are using it in the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the FDA we're hoping goes back
considers these facts and comes back with
[SPEAKER_04]: guidance that clearly defines,
and we're looking for structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not, we don't believe it's about
safety in the end, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Food safety, supplement safety and drug
safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't believe that we're not just
asking for carte blanche.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're saying come back with a reasonable
framework that we can implement on labels,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nutrition fact panels, ingredient fact
panels and something that we can actually
[SPEAKER_04]: put into our business plans as we build
and get into mass market retail.
[SPEAKER_03]: How important is the compliance of your
framework with other frameworks,
[SPEAKER_03]: international frameworks, other national
frameworks?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've spent a considerable amount of
effort and resources in creating a
[SPEAKER_04]: compliant and accredited manufacturing and
processing framework from CGMP.
[SPEAKER_04]: BRC was known as British retail consortium
at one point.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very high level of audit scheme for
food grade standards internationally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've gone after all of these
accreditations and audits in order to
[SPEAKER_04]: create a platform to launch quality safe
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: This industry has been plagued by a trust
issue with consumers, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There hasn't been a lot of trust between
consumers and where that product came
[SPEAKER_04]: from.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, where was it grown?
[SPEAKER_04]: How was it manufactured?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of been a gray market,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's time that folks in this
industry rise up and create standards and
[SPEAKER_04]: adhere to global standards of
manufacturing that will create trust with
[SPEAKER_04]: consumers and take this industry from
being a gray market industry into being a
[SPEAKER_04]: global market industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Gerrit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me introduce to you Dr. Francis S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Callan.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the CEO of Cloud9 RxOTC
Pharmaceuticals and also the founder of
[SPEAKER_03]: Cloud9 LLC.
[SPEAKER_03]: ROTC Pharmaceuticals established in
Switzerland in July, 2017 and has
[SPEAKER_03]: subsidiaries in Jamaica and France.
[SPEAKER_03]: Besides, he's a man member of the
International Association for Cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: Medicines, which makes him an expert on
both fields on the one side, on the
[SPEAKER_03]: economic field, on the other side,
on the medical field.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my first question to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently, the framework is about medicine
and about product.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you say needs to be,
needs to be implemented faster on an
[SPEAKER_03]: international level?
[SPEAKER_03]: The regulation for medical, international
regulations for medical, for cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: medicines or regulations for cannabis
products on an international level?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to qualify what Mika just said,
we're a company that do two things.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very active in the field of edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our first products we launched in
January of this year in Germany,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a Swiss chocolate containing the
cannabis extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're active in the area of
pharmaceuticals as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But pharmaceuticals is more our medium,
longer term business plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: We already have two products that are
ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is for the treatment of glaucoma and
the other one is for bronchial disorders,
[SPEAKER_05]: asthma particularly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were actually gonna ask me
about novel foods.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my second question because we have
to do some more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know you're the expert.
[SPEAKER_05]: The medical front in a way is somewhat
more advanced than the food area at the
[SPEAKER_05]: moment, particularly since you probably
all know that the WHO came out last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: The expert committee on drugs and
dependence came out with recommendations
[SPEAKER_05]: about rescheduling cannabis from schedule
four completely delisting it and also
[SPEAKER_05]: delisting cannabis extracts from schedule
one, which actually also gives hope to a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of the CBD players in the world
because if it's off that, then that
[SPEAKER_05]: supposedly can open up some opportunities
for the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Things are moving on the medical front
because in January of this year in the EU,
[SPEAKER_05]: a group of MEPs, they put a motion for
resolution to the European Commission that
[SPEAKER_05]: was adopted on the 17th of February.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the medical use, the harmonization of
the medical use of cannabis medicines in
[SPEAKER_05]: the EU and also to encourage and promote
research in the EU for medicine purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's moving ahead quite nicely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget in the background,
you also have GW Pharmaceuticals who
[SPEAKER_05]: applied for approval for Epidiolex in the
EU market too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pending.
[SPEAKER_05]: We expect something to come in the next
couple of months regarding that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The medical side is moving quite nicely
ahead in the EU market.
[SPEAKER_05]: The food side is in a bit of a chaos at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: A chaos because since January of this
year, everyone's been talking about novel
[SPEAKER_05]: foods this morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Up until 2018, it was already very
complicated and infragmented in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: the interpretation in different countries
in the EU.
[SPEAKER_05]: It got worse in January because the
European Commission decided to try and
[SPEAKER_05]: clarify things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was in an effort to clarify.
[SPEAKER_05]: They made some amendments to what's called
the novel foods catalog.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go on the internet, you type in
novel foods catalog EU, pop up a page and
[SPEAKER_05]: you can search in there and you can put in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today, there will be three references that
will come up, three entries.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is about the plant, cannabis sativa L,
which is not a novel food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabidiol has a red mark against it and
cannabinoids has a red mark against it
[SPEAKER_05]: too.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are at the moment up for novel food
status, let's say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put it that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another thing you need to understand
that the catalog itself different from the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation because there is an actual
regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me ask a small question in between
please just for the better understanding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis sativa L is also listed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the catalog and it's not a novel
food.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the THC level is in compliance,
you could put cannabis sativa L in the
[SPEAKER_05]: food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget, cannabis sativa has been
consumed in the European market for
[SPEAKER_05]: centuries.
[SPEAKER_05]: The European Industrial Hemp Association
met with the working group.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called, let me see now, it's got a
funny name, Plants, Animals, Food and
[SPEAKER_05]: Feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the name of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a working group that the commission
deferred to for determining whether a
[SPEAKER_05]: substance is considered novel food or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: The European Industrial Hemp Association
met with that committee on the 12th of
[SPEAKER_05]: March.
[SPEAKER_05]: They shared with them basically the usage,
the consumption, even industrial
[SPEAKER_05]: quantities of hemp products, hemp extracts
in the EU going back to 1220 in Bologna.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael Mosiman, I completely agree what
he was saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you actually say is that if you use
the term cannabis sativa L instead of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis L, you can circumship the
regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you need to understand your
regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to understand what type of
ingredients you're using, what is allowed
[SPEAKER_05]: and what's not allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to understand the regulation on
novel foods.
[SPEAKER_05]: Read it carefully because it is clear,
actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big document, but it is clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to understand the processing
conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to understand labeling because
currently today CBD on a product is not
[SPEAKER_05]: compliant.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason it's not compliant and the
reason why a lot of countries in the EU
[SPEAKER_05]: such as Austria, Italy, Germany most
recently have been marching in with police
[SPEAKER_05]: and removing products from the shelves and
fining people and arresting people is
[SPEAKER_05]: because CBD simply is not, yet considered
a novel food.
[SPEAKER_05]: The individual substance, the molecule of
CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's called cannabis sativa L,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you say is you just don't have to
put CBD on a label.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you avoid a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your cannabis sativa, of course it
contains CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to make a note on that, in US it's a
similar scenario with a lot of sellers on
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazon actually are selling CBD products,
but they're calling hemp extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a sleight of hand,
but by not calling out CBD specifically
[SPEAKER_04]: and calling it a hemp extract,
they're able to remain as resellers on
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's another confusion in the EU space
and it goes back to the change that was
[SPEAKER_05]: made in January.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the novel foods catalog, as I said in
2018, there were only cannabidiol and
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis sativa L.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what they did is in an effort,
I think to clarify, but it actually made
[SPEAKER_05]: it more confusing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just threw everything into one
basket, including extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is where the confusion also lies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it say cannabinoids in general or
does it define single cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_05]: It says cannabinoids in the entry and in
that entry they list all different
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids and they also make reference
to extracts also being considered a novel
[SPEAKER_05]: food.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's also a gray zone because they
don't specifically mention whether it's
[SPEAKER_05]: the leaf, whether it's the flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it made it worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: What they did is really made the situation
worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another MEP, a guy called Marco Zullo from
that crazy country, Italy, he wrote to the
[SPEAKER_05]: European Commission.
[SPEAKER_05]: He made an official written request to the
Commission to clarify this situation in
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe regarding foods and regarding
cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did that in March.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're given six weeks in order to
reply.
[SPEAKER_05]: The six weeks was up Friday last.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would love to be able to tell you
some latest hot news this morning,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there is none.
[SPEAKER_05]: There hasn't been any movements in the
last month from the European Commission.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been no hot news that we can share
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's election time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our third guest on the panel is Tom Suber
from Suber Lawyer in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: He founded Suber Lawyer together with his
brother, Jeff Suber in 2003.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom Suber facilitates collaboration among
his colleagues and assist them with
[SPEAKER_03]: growing and client relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Suber also manages intellectual
property and disputes and deals around the
[SPEAKER_03]: world and consults clients in relation to
global intellectual property portfolios.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I can say you are specialized also
on cannabis regulatory framework in
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first question is how does the
disparity of cannabis regulations between
[SPEAKER_03]: federal, state, provincial, and municipal
governments complicate cannabis commerce
[SPEAKER_03]: in the U.S.A.?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mika.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was originally asked to speak on an
intellectual property panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that bio was suited for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also on the managing partner of
Suber Lawyer, and we've been in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: for over 12 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we represent many of the biggest
players in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that context, I deal with a lot of
regulatory work, FDA work, and other work
[SPEAKER_00]: in association with cannabis companies,
as well as fortune companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: To answer your question, as far as the
disparity between federal and state and
[SPEAKER_00]: municipal regulations, cannabis-related
regulations in the states, it creates a
[SPEAKER_00]: great big mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess in that sense, it's not
unlike the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for folks who don't know,
in the United States, there are indeed
[SPEAKER_00]: three different levels of regulation to
oversimplify things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have, of course, the federal
regulation, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, and the FDA is going to,
at some point, regulate just about
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And underneath the federal regulations,
you have states, of course, much like
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, split into provinces.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EU split into countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States is split into 50 states
plus territories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each state has its own disposition
toward cannabis, CBD products,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC products, and other cannabinoid
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even within each state,
municipalities differ in the way that they
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate the cannabis, the plant,
and products that touch the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this context, there's a great
deal of variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though the federal government has
descheduled hemp, so in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: the prohibition of cannabis is affected by
what's called the Controlled Substances
[SPEAKER_00]: Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis, until recently, CBD as well,
has been on schedule one of that act,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Controlled Substances Act,
along with heroin and cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recently, just this year, Congress
descheduled CBD that's derived from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long as the CBD product contains less
than 0.3% THC, it's categorized as hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's legal, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even still, there are variances in
terms of the states and how they regulate
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an example, in California,
you can't just start growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't create a farm to start growing
hemp, and that's counterintuitive in some
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to partner currently with an
agricultural research institution,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's as complicated and complex as it
sounds, because there is no pathway to
[SPEAKER_00]: obtain a license to grow hemp in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that varies state by state in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, THC is still on schedule one
of the Controlled Substances Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's still treated like heroin,
at least theoretically.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the federal government turns the
other way, and so each of the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: states is left to regulate THC-containing
products, and there's a great deal of
[SPEAKER_00]: variance among the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 30 states have legalized THC to some
extent, whether to a medicinal level or to
[SPEAKER_00]: a recreational level, and then underneath
that, the municipalities also differ in
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that they regulate the THC plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you have in the end is really an
inability to have a national strategy in
[SPEAKER_00]: relation to a THC product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means, in effect,
is that you've got to begin operations de
[SPEAKER_00]: novo in each state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as to how this affects things,
well, as an example, it's awfully
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to create a brand in the sense
that you do in other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have a, well, let's say I'm having
a can of Coca-Cola here in Zurich,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have a can of Coca-Cola in Tokyo or
back home in California, I have
[SPEAKER_00]: substantially the same experience,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have exactly the same user experience,
almost the same brand experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: except for the language differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, if I go to the same retail
shop here in Zurich or in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience within a brand can change
month to month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then when you consider the fact that in
the United States, the regulations vary by
[SPEAKER_00]: state, and furthermore, you can't ship THC
across state lines in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much more difficult does it become to
create a consistent user experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you think about it,
that's everything that's associated with a
[SPEAKER_00]: brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the cannabis industry grows up,
this disparity between federal and state
[SPEAKER_00]: and municipal regulations is going to
increasingly become a greater focus for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis companies that are going to be
more ambitious in trying to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency of user experience underneath
the brand across state and sovereign
[SPEAKER_00]: borders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we have heard so far in any
country or in every country, the national
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations are not homogane all over,
are not homogane in most countries,
[SPEAKER_03]: even within the countries that differ.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on a scale from 1 to 10, Tom,
what would you say?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much does that influence the
international cannabis business
[SPEAKER_03]: development or the international
development of the cannabis business
[SPEAKER_03]: between 1 and 10 points?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would split that into two answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a THC answer, and I'd say it's a
10.
[SPEAKER_00]: In regard to hemp-derived CBD,
I'd say it's still probably a 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in regard to THC, obviously,
if you try and ship something across the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States border, you're going to get
arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In regard to hemp-derived CBD,
there are still issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal, but apparently some federal
institutions, some United States
[SPEAKER_00]: governmental institutions didn't get the
memo that hemp is now legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So products containing CBD will still get
stopped at the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've got to hire an attorney to
go educate relative governmental
[SPEAKER_00]: operatives and say, you know what,
this is legal and you need to let it
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's still going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD, it should make it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can theoretically ship CBD product
across the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, our law firm is involved in
conversations in relation to a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: territories throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you wouldn't assure a client that if
you try and ship CBD from here to there
[SPEAKER_00]: across the United States border,
that it won't get stopped because folks
[SPEAKER_00]: are still considering that a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got to explain,
oh, the farm bill was passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is legal now, and you need to let it
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a conversation and an argument
and a fight that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a function of legacy issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: My next question goes out to Gareth.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about frameworks,
international frameworks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I did some research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have enough frameworks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have MRA.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have GMP.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have GPP in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have GAMC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so why is cannabis not included or
cannot be included in the already existing
[SPEAKER_03]: international frameworks, which are in
compliance, actually?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's starting to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're starting to see that movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, BRC, that accreditation,
we just did that for the first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not that it couldn't be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that it hasn't been done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think GMP is one of those things
you're hearing a lot of the buzzword of
[SPEAKER_04]: GMP all over the world in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done it in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Canada, you have GPP, not GMP.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think you're starting to see
supply chains bridge those gaps
[SPEAKER_04]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, now we have to get a UEU GMP
audit company to fly to the United States
[SPEAKER_04]: to do the EU spec GMP audit in order to be
in compliance in Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not just in the US, which is a
different audit scheme.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that the industry is very
young.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as it matures, you're going to see the
international frameworks come together and
[SPEAKER_04]: start working the way that they should.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just hasn't been done yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think there's anything barring
the industries from doing that for legal
[SPEAKER_04]: products.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just it just takes time for that to
take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could also add to that, to what
Garrett had said, a lot of it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States, I think everywhere comes
from Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the FDA has expressed an intent to
make an exception in that regard,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's so much CBD product out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think everyone agrees that that
would be a bit silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be some sort of
threshold which categorizes CBD beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: that threshold of content as a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps that'll be a function also of the
usage of the CBD if it's applied to a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular physiological condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other forms of CBD used for other
purposes will still be categorized as food
[SPEAKER_00]: and and as a supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are governed by different tracks
under the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it just goes to show that that
the FDA was not prepared to receive this
[SPEAKER_00]: type of this type of subject matter,
the cannabis subject matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a function of that, it's going to
have to change some of the habits that it
[SPEAKER_00]: currently has, meaning some of the
policies that have existed to date.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: My next question question goes also
Francis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've heard that the EU is building up a
regulatory framework for Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also heard in the long term,
the US will set up a regulatory framework,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is which will be similar to the
Canadian.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: How how important is it that the European
and the authorities from overseas
[SPEAKER_03]: cooperate so the business can prosper and
develop?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also linked to what Tom was just
saying, because the way the FDA is
[SPEAKER_05]: approaching it and the way you're
anticipating the maybe the cutoff between
[SPEAKER_05]: what's a medicine and what's food or a
food supplement.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the European Commission are going
to legislate in the same way that's going
[SPEAKER_05]: to come later on this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will help to give clarity how it
should be how it should be approached.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think at a very high level between
the US between the EU, there are talks
[SPEAKER_05]: between the two two trading blocs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there will be a type of an
alignment that will come.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm anticipating this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my my crystal ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so it's not written in stone.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is I think what's going to happen
because there's too much at stake.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's too much at stake in terms of tax
dollars in terms of jobs, in terms of a
[SPEAKER_05]: whole new industry that's that's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that just needs to be freed a little
bit or given clear clarity and
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations, so it can go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: My next question is to Keith.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a very specific question.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Europe, we have a regulatory framework
for seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on in the US concerned about
hemp seeds, a regulatory framework?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything planned now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is the NIDA still importing seeds from
the EU?
[SPEAKER_04]: In the US, there is no framework like the
EU.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no registered list.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just need to have a legal framework.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to remain compliant under the
federal guidelines of point 3% THC or
[SPEAKER_04]: less.
[SPEAKER_04]: But outside of that, you're free to do
genetics work and we do and I think that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the structure of the EU seed
list is is cumbersome, especially for
[SPEAKER_04]: folks that want to innovate and create
more farming and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe that the the US framework is
more advantageous for farmers and for the
[SPEAKER_04]: market in general, because it doesn't have
strict regulations and registrations
[SPEAKER_04]: related to the individual seeds and
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's go to the novel food,
the novel food regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: My next question goes out to Francis about
that, because he's the expert on novel
[SPEAKER_03]: food regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the panel before, I estimated after the
novel food regulation is implemented,
[SPEAKER_03]: it will take another two up to three years
till all the national laws are
[SPEAKER_03]: implemented.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think there's a difference?
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope it won't take so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: There has to be a harmonization process.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it could be accelerated.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be accelerated because of the
changing economic landscape.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for sure, the EU doesn't want to be
fall behind what's going on in Canada and
[SPEAKER_05]: going on in the US.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to be competitive for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have an important lobby group,
the IHA again, which is receiving positive
[SPEAKER_05]: feedback from the European Commission.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm hoping that at EU level,
I think the clarification will come within
[SPEAKER_05]: this year, maybe towards the end of the
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then when it gets translated into the
national laws is where it takes time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that'll take another year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as a person who has contact to
authorities, you've got the feeling that
[SPEAKER_03]: the EU wants to be competitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too much money involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like a black sheep anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they want to be competitive.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: My next question goes out to Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk about framework, we also have
to talk about patents.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do different countries protect plant
genetics and other aspects of cannabis of
[SPEAKER_03]: technological value?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any experience in that in
California already?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there in the United States,
first of all, there's a funky sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: patent called the plant patent,
which is a bit peculiar to the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ways to protect plant
varieties in the EU and in other parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, but as there are in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the United States, you actually
have a particular type of patent that is
[SPEAKER_00]: designed to protect a strain, a set of
cannabis genetics that are produced
[SPEAKER_00]: asexually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this has been it's this historical
oddity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant patent exists in the United
States to protect a better strain of rose,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our law firm, Zuberwaller, has actually
just obtained what we believe to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: second ever issued U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: plant patent for a cannabis strain,
which is a pretty cool fact tidbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the United States, the there are
really a variety of ways now to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: the technology associated with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we move forward in terms of the
cannabis industry continuing to mature
[SPEAKER_00]: from an illegal industry toward a legal
industry, a corporate industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual property is going to
intersect increasingly with regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: frameworks like, for instance,
the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an example of that, the to take it
back to the FDA for a moment and then come
[SPEAKER_00]: back to patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FDA of course, when you think of the
FDA and you think of the approval process,
[SPEAKER_00]: you think typically of the drug approval
process, right, like a pediolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a 10 year process, a 10 year
plus process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a billion dollar plus process,
typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's that's got its threshold
that really typically is only met by a
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical company, given the enormous
resources that a pharmaceutical has a
[SPEAKER_00]: company has to throw at that type of
application process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are also two other tracks to
oversimplify things at the FDA that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to become relevant to cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the NDI track, which is for new
dietary ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that is basically supplements,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So supplements that are not quite drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a CBD product that you're
using for seizures like a pediolex,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a CBD product that you're
using for better sleep, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: considered a supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so typically you would put that
through the NDI track, the new dietary
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredient track.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of that track, you could even
get the ability to make certain claims
[SPEAKER_00]: like helps you sleep better or promotes
better energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are called structured function
claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a third track, which is called the
grass track.
[SPEAKER_00]: They generally recognize the safe track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that applies to foods like novel foods
here in the in the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that track also it takes about a
year like the NDI track.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's much less.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the low six figures, maybe one
hundred one hundred fifty thousand dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are reasonable pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about CBD products,
THC products, CBN products, these are
[SPEAKER_00]: typically aside from topical creams and
that sort of thing, they're all foods or
[SPEAKER_00]: supplements or drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the FDA will govern everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we think about when we think
about patents, the reason the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: they intersect with the with the FDA
processes is, for instance, if you if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're successful in obtaining an NDI
approval for supplements, say a tincture
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're going to use to help folks
sleep better at the end of that process in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others could ride the coattails of what
you've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that Francis puts through an
application with the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: He achieves an NDI approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a tincture now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can say it helps you sleep better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he starts to put that on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could come out and say, you know what,
I'm going to do what Francis did and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go ahead and put my product on
the shelf and ride the coattails of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can use theoretically,
you can use patents and other things to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it more difficult for me to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that Francis's application
were to rely on particulars like,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance, a particular strain that
he's patented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then in that sense, it's difficult
for me to do exactly what Francis has done
[SPEAKER_00]: without infringing that patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think what you're going to see as
we go forward is a greater communication,
[SPEAKER_00]: a greater intersection between
intellectual property and FDA frameworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also what we're going to see is a
bit of a reckoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what folks may not know out here in
Zurich, in the European Union,
[SPEAKER_00]: around Zurich, in the United States,
in California last July, 90 percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product came off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say that again, because it's
a phenomenal fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 percent of the product in legal retail
shops were taken off the shelves last
[SPEAKER_00]: July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they didn't comply with
regulations that came down last July.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amazing phenomenon that's associated
with that fact is we all knew it was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who thought about it last January
or February or March or April or May
[SPEAKER_00]: understood that most of the product was
going to come off the shelves in July when
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulations landed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some of us in the United States
who believe that sort of reckoning is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to happen at the federal level in
relation to FDA regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why is because it seems to
me and to others that the FDA has to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate any product that makes a claim
that it helps you sleep better or that it
[SPEAKER_00]: helps you improve energy or that it
improves your gut or what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it doesn't, then the FDA
becomes a mockery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of these products that are making
these claims now there is going to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of reckoning at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes sense for companies that
look to enter the United States to start
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking today about becoming compliant
tomorrow so that you have that advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're among that 10 percent or that
5 percent or 20 percent or whatever that
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage is that's compliant when the
FDA decides that they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But rest assured, the FDA will regulate
because all of this stuff is food,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's supplement, it's drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Garrett, I felt you wanted to say you
wanted to add something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, am I wrong?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, he's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been advising our brand partners
to lay off the claims, stay away from
[SPEAKER_04]: claims and stay away from letters from the
FDA that they have sent them out,
[SPEAKER_04]: notifying folks that they're making claims
that are unsubstantiated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So take a conservative route and wait for
the FDA guidelines, food, supplement or
[SPEAKER_04]: drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you compare the situation to the
European situation?
[SPEAKER_03]: In a way, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to wait a little bit more to get
the clarification.
[SPEAKER_05]: Within this year, I hope to see that at
the European level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, as I said before, it's going to take
time to translate that into the national
[SPEAKER_05]: laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it will take time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will take some time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer to be optimistic and positive
about this because there is a lot at
[SPEAKER_05]: stake.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I mention something on the Swiss
level?
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are short on time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because next month on the 13th and 14th of
June, all the Cantonal chemists are
[SPEAKER_05]: actually meeting with the federal office
in Bern to discuss CBD, to discuss
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis extracts, CBD, what to do in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you would also say Swiss authorities
want to be competitive meanwhile?
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to put clarification as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to do it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're watching what's going on in the
EU.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because on the food area particularly,
there is a strong alignment between Swiss
[SPEAKER_05]: legislation and EU legislation also
concerning novel foods.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason for this is because the
biggest export partner for Switzerland is
[SPEAKER_05]: the EU.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, it boils down to trade and
money, taxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think one gentleman earlier this
morning said Switzerland is one of the few
[SPEAKER_05]: countries that makes money out of this
whole business.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very, very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have time for a question or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question on the intellectual
property.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how does it work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like cannabis has been decentralized for
such a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been kind of a open source
software for breeders and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a couple of guys who try
to hide some strains or seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But usually it just gets out and
everybody's all in the mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can't really patent OG Kush or
train wreck or Bubba or anything like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, how do you decide that you own
the rights to a cannabis strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to take that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, that's such a big,
exciting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, I'm very interested in a couple
of days answering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll make a couple of points here as
succinctly as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, what you pointed out really
is a prior art problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry is so novel and
strange and wonderful for so many reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those reasons is that there was a
thriving illegal economy around cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for decades.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's all this information out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no prior art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I use the term prior art,
what I'm referring to is really all the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that's out there that the patent
office, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patent Office, that analogous patent
offices throughout the world will look at
[SPEAKER_00]: to determine if something comprises an
invention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the patent office sees
something today, somebody puts through an
[SPEAKER_00]: application to, let's say, obtain a patent
for anything with any product that has
[SPEAKER_00]: greater than 95 percent CBD content,
which is a patent that, for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: United Cannabis Corp.
[SPEAKER_00]: has attained.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patent office doesn't know what to do
with that because they're not aware that
[SPEAKER_00]: those products have existed because
everything was illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no prior art out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean to pick on that patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes that that's been through a
process of challenge and it's survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And United Cannabis Corp.
[SPEAKER_00]: deserves credit for obtaining that patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I do mean to point out is that
what you're looking to really is a prior
[SPEAKER_00]: art question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the cannabis industry, you don't
have access to the prior art that exists
[SPEAKER_00]: because nobody was talking about the
illegal stuff that they were doing
[SPEAKER_00]: experimenting with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to change now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing that I would point out is
that the cannabis industry is a technology
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that the cannabis industry
doesn't realize it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the patent litigation is going to
affect all of our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who's here with the cannabis
product will be affected by patent
[SPEAKER_00]: litigation in some way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is because there's so much
technology in that plant and there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: much technology that lies between the
plant and the human physiology that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't yet comprehend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many of the patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are a few patents today that
are celebrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my view and in the view of some of
my colleagues, these patents are not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily capturing the substance of the
technology that's inside the plant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that they're speaking to isolated
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that's so fascinating
about the plant is how complex the
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction is between the different
cannabinoids, terpenes and ballast and
[SPEAKER_00]: other biochemicals in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that these interactions
between these biochemicals affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: degree to which different cannabinoid
receptors within the human body take up a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an example, isolated CBD,
which is taken up by the CB2 receptor,
[SPEAKER_00]: not to geek out too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try and keep this as simple as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really taken up that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why if you take a CBD
product or you give it to your mom or your
[SPEAKER_00]: grandmother and they say, I don't feel
anything, that's not surprising because an
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated CBD compound does not get taken
up well by the CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you add a bit of THC and all of a
sudden the receptivity of the CB2 receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: to CBD increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: The entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really an understated way of
putting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing to keep in mind is that
there are over 100 cannabinoids in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many receptors in the human body
that take up cannabinoids, but we've only
[SPEAKER_00]: studied two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only currently test for between 13
and 28 cannabinoids, depending on who you
[SPEAKER_00]: ask and how you're counting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that tells you is there's so much
that we don't yet understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That technology is going to get patented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to, we're going to start
to see increasingly interesting patents
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking toward the interactions between
cannabinoids terpenes, ballasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other biochemicals in the plant,
the way that they interact with particular
[SPEAKER_00]: human physiological conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as these patents land, they'll be
enforced and all of us will be affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for keeping it very simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just a note on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've actually just started the process on
a, we announced a 0.0% THC cannabis strain
[SPEAKER_04]: in conjunction with the University of
Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's under the patent process at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that speaks to the genetics and the
plant side of that, and not as much to the
[SPEAKER_04]: receptor and to the entourage of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one more question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have one more?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just on the three components or whatever
that are registered under the novel foods
[SPEAKER_01]: book, was it, or catalog?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's three entries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis sativa L is defined as what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a little bit ambiguous.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there are 63 varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: 69, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 69 varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the common registry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plant itself is cannabis sativa L.
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is not 69 varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's two things.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's common registry, which Garrett was
referring to earlier in the EU.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for crops and for consumer products,
you have to use a plant that's listed on
[SPEAKER_05]: that registry for it to be compliant with
EU regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why you have things like EU
certified hemp, because it's a hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: variety that's on that list.
[SPEAKER_05]: But novel foods is another regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a complete different regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has nothing to do with, there's no
bridge between the two.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they talk about cannabis sativa L,
they talk about it as its use in food
[SPEAKER_05]: products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it talks about whether you can use the
seed or whether you can use the leaf or
[SPEAKER_05]: the stalk or the root or the flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the problem with the entry in the
catalog is that it doesn't explicitly say
[SPEAKER_05]: some things to make it clear what you can
use or what you cannot use.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by absence, it's quite ambiguous to
understand what is meant by that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the problem that's linking with
that entry in the catalog, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all so very, very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are unfortunately out of time,
but that was very informative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
