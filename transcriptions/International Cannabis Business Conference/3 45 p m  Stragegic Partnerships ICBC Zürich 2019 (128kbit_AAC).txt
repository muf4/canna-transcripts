[SPEAKER_06]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, are you ready?
[SPEAKER_06]: To discuss strategic partnerships,
we've got an All-Star panel to be
[SPEAKER_06]: moderated all the way from wherever he's
from.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it for Benjamin Potts.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the way from Berlin, Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that far.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that far.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for coming to the last panel
of today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to be quick, so we are all
out here before 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Benjamin Potts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I work for a company called Bolton.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might or might not have heard of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're the producer of these little small
unification pouches.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are really like a small medium
company from the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we would not be able to participate in
this global market space.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it wasn't for the partnerships that we
have with Russell Cope.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're a small company of 30 people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cannabis just happened to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're originally from the cigar
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our product, what it does is you throw
it into any type of closed container.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would just keep the humidity stable
at the higher level.
[SPEAKER_05]: For cannabis, the highest possible level
would be under 65%.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a 62% solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: This little pouch would give and remove
moisture at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all natural based on osmosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just happened to be fantastic for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when it dries out, you lose all
the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you sell flour that's too dry,
you lose money.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's too moist, you lose everything to
mold.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just heard that mold is one of the
worst things that can happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we sell to companies like Aurora in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all over the globe here in Switzerland
and Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would not be possible without
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not all of these partnerships are
strategic though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of them are just pure buyer-seller
relationships.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have some real strategic
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is something we want to discuss
today at this panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to have a first quick
round of introduction of everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just going right to left, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Morco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run a company called Highlight Media.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're located in Zurich, Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it took me 20 minutes to get here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do everything marketing related.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have more than 20 million followers on
social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Google websites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we help companies in the cannabis
industry to find a reasonable and
[SPEAKER_01]: transparent way to promote their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the cannabis industry is still
heavily restricted by Google, Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't run ads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to find other ways to get the
word out and get exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we help with everything that's needed
for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I now want to be Marco because he's got
more followers and better looking than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Clinton Young.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the president of Company X,
which is made up of two companies called
[SPEAKER_03]: Greenology and Swissemcare.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do everything with CBD from seed to
sale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am also the co-founder of The Lost
Organization, which is a mental health
[SPEAKER_03]: group based in Hamilton, Ontario,
Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a 2,500 square foot facility,
250 square meters.
[SPEAKER_03]: That gives back to the community for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're struggling, we help you with
free yoga classes, right here,
[SPEAKER_03]: peer-to-peer counseling, group sessions,
and then also all the way up to TED Talks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's me in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Brad Wyatt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am CEO of CBD Global Sciences.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're based out of Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Started 2014, 2015 as a farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strasburg Farms, just east of the DIA
Airport there in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And started to see the compression of the
market already.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we started out, we saw prices of $700
per pound to grow CBD-enriched biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're down around $50 to $60 per
pound for a good 10% to 12% CBD biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very quickly, we saw that going
vertical was going to be a very strategic
[SPEAKER_02]: move.
[SPEAKER_02]: We launched our first brand, which is
still with us, Cannon Oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have a sports wellness brand
called Apix.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you open up your insert, you'll see
Apix.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got hydration.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got lotions, topicals, all sorts of
things that are going to help you out when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're trying to push out that last mile
as a marathon runner or whatever it is
[SPEAKER_02]: that might hail you if you're trying to
exercise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we're going to be going public on
the CSC.
[SPEAKER_02]: CSC in three weeks, so knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about strategic alliances,
per se.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what type of strategic alliances did
you have that you, well, if they're not
[SPEAKER_05]: valuable, they wouldn't be strategic.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's obvious.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what are the most outstanding
strategic alliances that you guys have or
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe have had in the past?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just an open question.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, when it comes to strategic
partnerships or strategic alliances,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not per se have.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what you kind of want to look for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've had in the past terrible strategic
partnerships in Canada, things that have
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely imploded the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen everything over the 12 years
that I've been over in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving forward in a positive manner of
strategic partnerships, what you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: look for and what you're looking for is to
not only stay within your own country,
[SPEAKER_03]: but to look outside to work with other
countries, to work with people who have
[SPEAKER_03]: missing components that your company may
need to table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got to also look at who they are
as people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do your personalities, do your moral
compasses all come alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you're involved with these
people, you're not just involved with
[SPEAKER_03]: these people sometimes with three to six
months when it comes to purchasing my
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're sometimes involved with these
people for upwards of 10 to 15 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a component that you do your
research on who you're partnering with,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're there with them for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what I learned from not only
mistakes that I made in Canada,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'm at fault sometimes with
myself, you really need to do your due
[SPEAKER_03]: diligence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't, it can expire quite
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe I can talk a bit about the
media aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really based on the recreational
side of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why recently I partnered up
with the big medical cannabis network so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we together we can cover the medical
side, the recreational side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, it's also important that the
information that we put out that we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: good background that what we post or what
we share or the articles that we write
[SPEAKER_01]: that is legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to the medical side,
that's an aspect that I miss or that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not there or I'm not there where I want to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll make sure that I work with this
medical group that's run by doctors and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also give me more knowledge,
more power, and it makes it look better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's just, we always look out
for partners that can leverage what we do,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we also want to leverage what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always want to look for these
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you felt the need to go to the medical
side?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you decide that this is an area
that was likely used to teach you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for me, it's always like I'm
happiest when I can post a video and teach
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who gets released with medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me more pleasure than just post
stuff about getting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's an important aspect that I
want to get high as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you self-medicating against life?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke cannabis during work,
but sometimes after a hard day,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel my head is exploding and I just
want to sit back, smoke a joint,
[SPEAKER_01]: and relax and prepare for the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't come wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have that important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, to add to the strategic partnership,
in a vertical business, we stay in our
[SPEAKER_02]: lane, but we pretty much own all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, strategic partnership is
bringing in like the larger retailers that
[SPEAKER_02]: have never done this in the US before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're talking a lot of name brands
that they're kind of waiting on the
[SPEAKER_02]: sideline to see what the FDA is going to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others are already moving into the
topicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So helping them in seeing how to educate
the population.
I mean, if you look at it, the majority of
the non-Canada states in America right
[SPEAKER_02]: now, if you go and ask somebody what the
CPD needs, they have no clue.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pented up demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once our retailers know that that's
sitting out there waiting for us to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: to, they're going to be very, very
strategic in what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do you choose partners?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you said you have to do the other
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so first of all, where do you find
two changing partners other than ICBC?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you start the process in getting to
know potential partners?
[SPEAKER_05]: With engines, of course, you have to have
a fit for both partners.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what's the first step?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the first step is getting into the
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You meet people everywhere you go,
in cannabis and in industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you meet everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it could be people in retail in Canada,
when I was the CEO, of NMJ Canada,
[SPEAKER_03]: people would be coming into the
dispensaries all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would see 20, 30,000 people a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are dropping off product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are picking up money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are introducing new products
to the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take their card.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take their contact.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, the step is getting out there and
speaking and publicly talking about who
[SPEAKER_03]: your brand is marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Essentially, having a public base to your
brand is important.
And getting out there, like I said
earlier, doing your due diligence on the
[SPEAKER_03]: brand job, you connect with them and going
after it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can't do this all alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: This industry is so massive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you were saying, as soon as a retail
sees something that's ahead of demand,
[SPEAKER_03]: they instantly want to vertically innovate
with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's important with any of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: To us, for me, Company X is a strategic
partnership.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's two amazing companies that have
formed, not formed, but their own entities
[SPEAKER_03]: that have joined together to distribute,
to do distribution, and work with
[SPEAKER_03]: different countries and grow hemp all over
the world.
And each person on my board that makes up
Company X is my strategic partner.
Without my partners, I cannot get through
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all specialize in one major thing,
or probably department in multiple major
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all stay in our lane and we use our
synergies, become great at what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, I guess that's the best example of
what a strategic partnership is for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because my board is one big strategic
partnership.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're very blessed because we get to
use all of our resources, mine from Canada
[SPEAKER_03]: and other parts of the world that I work
with, all the people from Switzerland who
[SPEAKER_03]: work in multiple different countries
throughout the EU.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get to blend them into Company X
and work with everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, that is a major important part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm quite blessed to actually have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a very important aspect,
you need to have a good overview of who's
[SPEAKER_01]: present in this market.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the top players going to the
Expos?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then stuff like ICBC, meet the people
who are basically operating in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: field as you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to talk to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to get your name out there,
build your brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as you do that, you will find
out soon enough who could be a great fit
[SPEAKER_01]: to form such a strategic partnership.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next step that we found.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that I forgot.
[SPEAKER_02]: On a strategic partnership, there's got to
be a mutual benefit for both.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, for example, I described the retailers
coming to us looking for information,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's also a need on our part.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, how to connect to their back
end systems so that they can press a
[SPEAKER_02]: button and order straight to our system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to have that set up with UPC on
the actual product itself, so that it
[SPEAKER_02]: meets all of their standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to lean on our strategic partner
just like they're going to lean on us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a two sided road.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you say, how do you go look for
them?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they usually will come with the
same kind of being once you introduce
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself as, hey, this is what I have to
offer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can add one example.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are selling to a company that is in
the FMCG so fast, but we can see we get
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, this is just a buy and sell
relationship that we had in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we helped them keeping their product
in perfect condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time, this is a super highly
automated industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has new challenges for us to not our
product per se, but the way we deliver
[SPEAKER_05]: these products that it has to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fully automated machinery is at
high speed, for instance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this partnership now brings us into a
position to actually go after more
[SPEAKER_05]: markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is probably what you mean by the
beneficial, mucho benefit in these type of
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I totally agree on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you think were the most
valuable strategic partnerships that you
[SPEAKER_05]: have?
[SPEAKER_05]: This can be highly individual.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, but no, it's maybe not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so from the past, and this kind of
sounds weird because he's sitting up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my biggest strategic partnerships
was Boveda.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I ran retail in Canada, we had major
issues with the cannabis staying fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think all of the cannabis industry
in Canada that was on the retail side
[SPEAKER_03]: could agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: As he said, turkey dry out flavor
disappears.
[SPEAKER_03]: THC levels drop and rise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabinoids disappear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a major issue for our brand at
one point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually affecting everything from
the way we were growing or trying
[SPEAKER_03]: different styles.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from packaging, you're trying to
packaging and spending money there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, it gets to a point
where you're losing sales and you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: do something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we started working with Boveda and we
were purchasing many, many amounts of
[SPEAKER_03]: packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had 11 stores across Canada and about
$65,000 because we were represented as a
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal cannabis brand, wellness
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as soon as we started putting the
Boveda packs into our cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: it would keep it fresh for at least the
next couple of weeks at a time to preserve
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis that we were giving to
patients that needed the most high end
[SPEAKER_03]: quality because that's what cannabis in
Canada was known for.
[SPEAKER_03]: We specialized in having the top quality
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once it started to drop and drop
drastically in different climates,
[SPEAKER_03]: we had to figure out what to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure enough, Boveda was there and it
was like, I've never even met him today.
[SPEAKER_03]: He handed me the card.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not staged.
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was literally, I was like, Oh my God,
you're Boveda.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we used you forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's really neat on,
on what it did for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though I didn't talk,
it was a simple purchase.
[SPEAKER_03]: That strategic partnership was one of the
smartest plays MMJ Canada ever did because
[SPEAKER_03]: it re put our sales back to where they
were when they were at their peak because
[SPEAKER_03]: our candidates became fresher again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our qualities went back to where we were.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started winning multiple awards on the
quality of product and award ceremonies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really helped us along to get to
where we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: To give you an example, I have a
partnership with a company called Wiccan
[SPEAKER_01]: Mortar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are based in America and they're one
of you needing branding HSE in a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of months ago we posted a
video they created and the video reached
[SPEAKER_01]: like 3 million people within a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CEO hit me up and was like,
thank you very much for the wide video.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we work together?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did, we put an agreement in
place where they can use my network for
[SPEAKER_01]: their clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in return, they helped me to really
improve the branding of highlight media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they looked at all the assets we have
and they improved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we work together on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another example is we started to sell
a company I own equity in is CBT Dog
[SPEAKER_01]: Treats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a partnership with the
University of Prague.
[SPEAKER_01]: They helped us to formulate these snacks
together with veterinarians and now we're
[SPEAKER_01]: running clinical studies there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like I said, this is a scientific
background that you need when you sell
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ask me, I just, I don't want to put
out a product and don't know what happens
[SPEAKER_01]: when you like administer the dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like it needs to work and we need to
make sure it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think the university is the perfect
partner to like really give us the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific background to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably one of our distributors that
handles a lot of the smaller tier stores
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too big for one company to handle,
but you know, they've got 400 salespeople,
[SPEAKER_02]: they go out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we actually started to upload our
information into their system,
we realized just how far away we were from
being able to work with the partner.
So they kind of schooled us up and got us
ready for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the systems that we were using to how
we're labeling, you name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, that was pretty strategic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everyone in the US wants to try
CBT, so why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets worse if you answer more
markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in time to market, it gets more and
more important, obviously, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: with the pressure that's rising,
even in this, everybody thinks it's a boom
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, but there's a burden that comes
with it, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And strategic alliance partnerships play a
big role in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you kind of want to play on what you
just said.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the last partnership that you have with
the Whitney Motors, so basically,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was like a like a test project that you
guys did, or what is on?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you didn't even want to have a
strategic partnership with these guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it that it happens by accident?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is it really that you want to have a
strategic partnership and then do like a
[SPEAKER_01]: test project, which is very wise thing to
do, in my opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: It happened by accident, but after the
video went viral, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: the CEO contacted me, we had a talk for
like 50 minutes, and he was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to buy your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, it's not gonna
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was like, how can we work together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, funny approach, but I mean,
it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we started, it was not a
partnership that I was actively looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what I said at the beginning,
if you at these expos, if you talk to the
[SPEAKER_01]: right people, like, it's gonna pop up and
it's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just need to like go to these
events, get your name out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: get your brand out there, and then make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so let me identify the ones you work
with.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the first step?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it like this test project maybe,
or how do you start this partnership?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say, well, when we identify
a need for our company, that's what I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: start looking for, that partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's finding better genetics,
or moving, land or grows to different
[SPEAKER_02]: locations to mitigate the risk from
natural disasters, such as storms and
[SPEAKER_02]: hail, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are all opportunities,
much like what we're all here together,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're networking, but that's where you
find people that may have something of
interest, and you never know what they're
gonna come up with, because they may have
a need on their side that you can fill
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: For myself, and I'll use Company X again
as the example of strategic partnership,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it is two companies that work
together on this joint venture of
[SPEAKER_03]: distribution and extraction, and we use
the assets of both companies while
[SPEAKER_03]: distributing to Company X, and we use the
products and all the stuff that they grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, having two different companies
working together and using the specialties
[SPEAKER_03]: of each person is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when it started, it started off
slowly, it was conversations, friendly
[SPEAKER_03]: banter, and then you get more serious as
time goes on, and you start learning more
[SPEAKER_03]: and more about these people, and then you
take this next step forward, but I think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's important that, again, you do your
due diligence when you get into bed with
[SPEAKER_03]: these people, because it could be for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do all the steps, and you cross
all the T's and dot the I's, and you get
[SPEAKER_03]: to know these people, you would have a
process, I think people think they need to
[SPEAKER_03]: rush in cannabis, like you're the green
rush, constantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't rush, you're gonna burn yourself
out, and you're gonna end yourself in the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you that now, you're talking
to a person who almost did it to himself
[SPEAKER_03]: last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important that you get to know these
people, because you're gonna be spending a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of time with them, it's important that
you know the morals and everything makes
[SPEAKER_03]: sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, I'm very lucky that when both
of these companies, that work together
[SPEAKER_03]: under the umbrella of Company X,
all the personalities, and all the things
[SPEAKER_03]: that they brought to the table,
were what, one person was specialized,
[SPEAKER_03]: the next person is gonna add.
So we have someone that educates in the
medicinal cannabis side, in this
association, they have a public figure,
they have an extraction specialist.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it was important, the stages that
we took, and it was something that I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't do before, so I actually learned so
much from this process, because they
[SPEAKER_03]: initiated it, and then included me in
after.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was an amazing process to watch,
because the Europeans did it a completely
[SPEAKER_03]: different way, than I'd ever had it done
in North America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I learned so much, because it was a
more humbling way, it was a more calming
[SPEAKER_03]: way, the way that people are that I work
with, they're a lot different than myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: just in general, but in general,
more than North America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, if you can learn from these
people, and grow off these people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can create some amazing synergies,
and awesome strategic goals, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: or, you know, eventually hopefully sales,
and mutual benefits, is it from one
[SPEAKER_03]: another.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so we're running a little bit
out of time, so just last round of
[SPEAKER_05]: questions, because you mentioned that some
of the partnerships, they went bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, just like two sentences, what were
like the worst partnerships, like the
[SPEAKER_05]: people that you have, and how did you get
out of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was working with the city of Hamilton,
trying to educate them on regulating
[SPEAKER_03]: retail dispensaries, and at the very end,
you stopped the knife from my back,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I just simply said, see you later,
alligator, I'm out.
Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: To the point of vetting the people that
you're gonna work with, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: sharks, that are swimming around our
industry, and throughout, you really have
to do your due diligence in vetting them,
and it's not just about proof of funds,
you don't trust them going right into it,
and, yeah, I mean, we had a strategic
partnership, well over a 10 million dollar
contract, that went sideways, and it was
litigation.
So, you know, there's pieces to your
vetting, that you have to do on the front
side, you cannot assume in this industry,
that people are going to be good,
or look out for your best interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: This could also be control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'm Swiss, or if it's
because I have a legal background,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just, if I start a partnership,
I wanna have a good agreement in place,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that makes it a lot easier afterwards,
if things don't work out, and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna happen, but so far, we didn't have,
like, super bad experience, but sometimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: after a couple of months, you feel,
or you start to see that it's not working
[SPEAKER_01]: out, then you're gonna be happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a straight contract,
everything is black and white,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're gonna have a lot less problem
later on.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're running out of time a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're out of time, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have time for a couple of questions,
or one question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe one question, if someone has a brief
question, all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go, quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, it's William from Green Queen magazine
in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: From each of you, what do you think is the
best bit of information we can give to the
[SPEAKER_00]: end user to empower them through this
whole process, because as I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's surrounded by sharks.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we empower the end user?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they need to know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Be yourself, and don't allow the industry
to change who you become to fit into their
[SPEAKER_03]: circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it doesn't fit, simply become amicable
and walk away.
Don't force yourself into a scenario.
There are thousands and thousands of
companies, including everyone,
[SPEAKER_03]: women, transgender, ethnic groups,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just make sure that you include people,
and make sure that you don't rush into
[SPEAKER_03]: something or choose something and change
who you are to get a business deal done,
[SPEAKER_03]: because in the end, it's gonna backfire on
yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, it's really, you have to have very
clear vision of what you want to achieve,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can never renegotiate the quality
of the relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: There can be ups and downs, but at the
end, it's just be like, this is something
[SPEAKER_05]: that you have to look for.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I said, it's not, conferences don't
stop talking to each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else, if you have a solid
foundation of people you work with,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's probably key.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say try to mitigate all
assumptions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually that's where people become
disappointed, because when you make an
[SPEAKER_02]: assumption, and it doesn't go the way that
one party or the other didn't expect it
[SPEAKER_02]: because an assumption was made or allowed
to stay there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You already mentioned contracts,
it's a perfect way to get assumptions out
[SPEAKER_02]: on the table and squash them, because
that's usually where discipline is gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's like you have to be honest,
you have to be transparent, and at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the day, you just have to trust your
feeling, and the more experience you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more likely you're able to really know
if it's beneficial or not, and should do
[SPEAKER_01]: it or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: The experience is key.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it once again.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: That concludes the 2013 International
Campus Business Conference here in Zurich.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd like to thank our sponsors,
Ivory.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd like to thank Bank.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd like to thank CBD and Global
Sciences.
