[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're so happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are talking to you now about giving a
voice to the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very important topic because the
industry, as you guys heard me talk about,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of you who were here yesterday,
that the industry is changing the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order for us to do that
effectively, we've got to harness this
[SPEAKER_01]: voice and make it more effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ICBC put together a very impressive
panel of experts on this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to let them introduce
themselves because they know who they are
[SPEAKER_01]: and what they do better than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start down there with Georg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Georg, everyone here, as you do this,
tell them who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them a little bit about, being brief,
your history in the cannabis industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're currently doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, hi.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Georg Wurth, and I'm in the lobby
field for cannabis since 2002 as the head
[SPEAKER_07]: of German Cannabis Association,
working for legalization all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we made a big step end of 2019.
[SPEAKER_07]: Until then, we represented both industry
and private people at the same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we split that off and built a new
association, which is the one of mine on
[SPEAKER_07]: the panel here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm only the lobbyist for private
people since that time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm a little bit displaced here as a
voice for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been there a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not anymore a voice for the cannabis
industry, just indirect, maybe because the
[SPEAKER_07]: industry, of course, profits from my work
when I'm successful and get the
[SPEAKER_07]: legalization of cannabis in Germany done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would argue that being a voice for the
people is a voice for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need the people to be involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy you're here, Georg,
and I think what you're going to give us
[SPEAKER_01]: is a lot of valuable insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, sitting next to Georg is our
colleague Finn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Finn, take it away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, my name is Finn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the founder and managing director of
the Sanity Group.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are a German-based cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, we're focusing on two different
aspects.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're focusing on medicinal cannabis,
like everything prescription-related,
[SPEAKER_04]: with our brand Viamid, but also looking
into finished pharmaceuticals and medical
[SPEAKER_04]: devices.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other hand, we have our consumer
health unit, which is Sanity Care,
[SPEAKER_04]: with big CBD brands like Vi in this place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for us, it's super important to bring
the whole topic in Germany forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: We co-founded two associations.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is the Association Pro CBD,
and the other one is the BPC, the German
[SPEAKER_04]: Medical Cannabis Companies Association.
[SPEAKER_04]: So being a voice for the cannabis industry
in Germany or in whole Europe is a very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very big topic for me, and that's
something I work for very hard,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so I'm very happy to be here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our next panelist is Marijn,
and Marijn, it's your turn.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, my name is Marijn Roers van Hoogte.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm originally Dutch, but I'm living a
long time in Germany already.
[SPEAKER_09]: My background is I'm a biologist.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a huge passion for health.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm an industrial raw material.
[SPEAKER_09]: I started in building materials,
textiles, food, and since 2019,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm one of the founding members of the
Bundchenfuband Cannabis Wirtschaft,
[SPEAKER_09]: the German Trade Association for hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very important for us to be a voice
to get all the people involved in the
[SPEAKER_09]: industry together and to form one voice
against media, against politicians,
[SPEAKER_09]: to make sure that we achieve all the
market requirements, all the regulatory...
[SPEAKER_09]: They said it's a place at the table to
make sure that everybody gets what he
[SPEAKER_09]: wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to my left is my friend, Beau Whitney.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's kind of a big deal in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go ahead, Beau.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not a whole lot of economists
that have industry experience,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so there's a fair amount of demand for
my services.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this capacity, Michael Correa,
the governmental affairs person for NCIA,
[SPEAKER_03]: the National Cannabis Industry
Association, was not able to make it here,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so he asked me to stand in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I serve as the chief economist for NCIA,
so I'm here not as mantis in this regard,
[SPEAKER_03]: but NCIA.
[SPEAKER_03]: NCIA is the largest and oldest and most
diverse trade association in the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States, and they're doing some great work
both at the federal level and at the state
[SPEAKER_03]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the CEO of Bang, Inc., which is a
publicly traded cannabis edibles company,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've been a member of NCIA for 10
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our membership dues in that
organization go to lobbying the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government for changes, and what I'll give
NCIA credit for is lobbying really hard
[SPEAKER_01]: for the Safe Banking Act and for the Moore
Act, for those of you who are familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the NCIA is making big, big strides in
their lobbying effort towards
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this, this isn't really a panel on
lobbying so much as it is giving a voice
[SPEAKER_01]: to the industry, and that can look a lot
of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lobbying is one of those ways,
but what I would like to do is ask Georg,
[SPEAKER_01]: who just recently made a big change when
you split into two separate entities,
[SPEAKER_01]: one giving a voice to the people and one
giving a voice to the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically, tell us how what you're
doing is moving the needle, giving people
[SPEAKER_01]: a voice about legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us about that split.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really interesting to see how
different is the work in both fields.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did both together for many years,
and that was a very big range of things to
[SPEAKER_07]: do, and sometimes not really fitting good
together, something like that,
[SPEAKER_07]: like an industry association doesn't
organize demonstrations usually with
[SPEAKER_07]: dreadlocked people running around and
screaming loud and so on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a people's movement, we are working
much more public.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are really bringing people into the
game in the social media issues and making
[SPEAKER_07]: really big protests.
[SPEAKER_07]: We reach a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can move a lot of people to make the
right click at the right time and so on.
[SPEAKER_07]: As an industry association, you work much
more silent behind the doors, in the back
[SPEAKER_07]: rooms and so on, talking directly to
people, and you reach others people,
[SPEAKER_07]: other parties especially.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the left side, the parties are more
looking what are associations saying
[SPEAKER_07]: coming from a civil liberty standpoint.
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the other side, the conservative
side, they are more hearing about what is
[SPEAKER_07]: big economy saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was one of the reasons why I did
this step to reach really both together,
[SPEAKER_07]: both associations together, different
kinds of politicians and doing that
[SPEAKER_07]: necessary different kinds of work
specialized on both sides to have perfect
[SPEAKER_07]: results on both sides.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's important to work together as
an industry association and as a people's
[SPEAKER_07]: movement and support each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: A great example of that in the United
States was what just happened in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York just passed recreational
cannabis, which surprised everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more importantly, there were two bills
on the table and one was giving licenses
[SPEAKER_01]: to the highest bidder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew it was gonna be big business
that came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well the New York legacy market has been
operating for so many years by really
[SPEAKER_01]: people of color in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other bill had home grow,
had elements that were more leaning toward
[SPEAKER_01]: the little guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in an example of what George is
talking about, there was an effort
[SPEAKER_01]: organized by the happy monkey,
which is basically a speakeasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they sent an email out to their 25,000
member list, which is basically they're a
[SPEAKER_01]: list of illicit deliveries that they make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, hey, we need to go into
storm the government and tell them that we
[SPEAKER_01]: want option B and not option A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they went and stormed the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally they had 10 days before the vote
and thousands of people wrote and called
[SPEAKER_01]: and protested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they ended up getting option B.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they're going to have consumption
lounges and home grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is not going to give licenses to
the highest bidder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people like George who are organizing
the citizens are making a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious, Finn, you're part of the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're part of the conservative party.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a businessman, not a lobbyist.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you perceive governments view the
cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: And tell us about how, from your
perspective, all of this is happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, ironically in this context,
I'm a member of the conservative party for
[SPEAKER_04]: 22 years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But having said that, in 2002 for the
first time I was organizing protests
[SPEAKER_04]: within the party for legalization of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in the days, and I tried to answer
the question slowly, very precisely.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's still worthwhile to go
back in the days in 2002 when I wrote my
[SPEAKER_04]: first applications of legalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way how the conservative party
perceived me was like, what the hell is
[SPEAKER_04]: going on with this guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in the wrong room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is a member of our party suddenly
writing applications for admitting that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I look at it now, and in the last
20 years I had a lot of positions in the
[SPEAKER_04]: party and I always try to be a bit active,
I saw that the picture is really changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just yesterday there has been
Erwin Rüdel here who is one of the CDU
[SPEAKER_04]: guys who is in the parliament.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the head of the health commission in
the German parliament.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's a really high up conservative CDU
guy and he wants to legalize.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot has changed over that
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's definitely the good news.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bad news is that I still have the
feeling talking to politicians almost
[SPEAKER_04]: every day it's still very mixed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So politicians don't have much knowledge
about the cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_04]: People like Georg and also people like
you, you're working on changing it every
[SPEAKER_04]: single day by talking to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of the politicians I know don't
even know the difference between the THC
[SPEAKER_04]: and CBD, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for them, it's just the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even hemp seed oil for them is just the
same.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something with cannabis and that
should be illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of education that needs
to happen.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bo was letting me know he wants to
comment on what you just said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the United States, I think a lot of the
politicians still have this stereotype
[SPEAKER_03]: associated with cannabis businesses and
cannabis operators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they think of them more from the
traditional market rather than from the
[SPEAKER_03]: modern day market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of the roles that NCI does is
we bring this legitimacy and this
[SPEAKER_03]: professionalism to the politicians so that
they see the industry in a different
[SPEAKER_03]: light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's really, really
important to transition away from the
[SPEAKER_03]: stereotype and more into the into the
business and legitimate types.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told everyone yesterday and part of the
we jokingly refer to ourselves as the
[SPEAKER_01]: female cannabis mafia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a group of women CEOs that we are
a formal group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We invite politicians to a monthly dinner
with industry leaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And invariably, they say to us,
oh, wow, you have supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have logistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have three PL.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't realize we're really an
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think we all have dreadlocks and bump
Bob Marley while we're, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it freaks them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a perfect point that we're all here
showing them that we're really an
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marin, tell us about your lobbying
efforts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think that's a it's a good point.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think education is at the basis of
everything we do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the most important things that
happened to the split of the D.H.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fowl and the beef feed C.W., the German
Association for Cannabis Industry,
[SPEAKER_09]: is that we show how diverse the landscape
is of all possible stakeholders in the
[SPEAKER_09]: industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a very broad topic which goes into
very different types of branches and that
[SPEAKER_09]: it can be useful for a lot of different
industries from law to agriculture to
[SPEAKER_09]: textile to high end applications,
machine building, food, also science.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it was already there and now
finally the time is coming.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have see a lot of momentum coming up
also by companies like like Finns,
[SPEAKER_09]: everything that's coming over from from
North America, that there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: momentum and people have a lot of
questions and they need one central point,
[SPEAKER_09]: a independent point for getting those
answers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think as in the trade association,
we can form such a point of information
[SPEAKER_09]: for politicians, for media, for interested
companies to take away uncertainties,
[SPEAKER_09]: risks in order to make them easier with
the topic of hemp and see what kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: options they have with this new emerging
industry and how it can help them and
[SPEAKER_09]: their people, electorates, companies,
etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thought that went through my head when
you were giving us your answer was that
[SPEAKER_01]: you play an important role in moving the
industry forward, but it's also a big
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like any quote-unquote representative
form of anything if you get your personal
[SPEAKER_01]: agenda caught up in things, it can also be
problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you keep yourself neutral or how
do you make sure you're representing the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual industry?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, for me personally, I always keep the
plant central.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are working with a natural resource.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's all about the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all have different reasons why we went
into this industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, it's the high potential of it,
its naturality, how it shows us that we
[SPEAKER_09]: need to return to circular economy,
we have zero waste options, we're a very
[SPEAKER_09]: modern day products.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it shows that we can choose different
ways but still live in the same way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think all companies, all people I
met share that same kind of ideology.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's also what I like to
transmit to politicians and to media,
[SPEAKER_09]: that it's much more than just a drug or a
medicine or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a solution for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's our job at the moment to show
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well-being over money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my point yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, Bo, tell us how an economist,
you're a number cruncher essentially,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does number crunching function in a
lobbying situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you using your skill set and your
education to impact the industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a lot of the policy as the industry
transitioned, a lot of the policies were
[SPEAKER_03]: based upon what was going on in the
headlines.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a New York Times reporter that
had a bunch of edibles in Colorado and
[SPEAKER_03]: freaked out and then all of a sudden
there's these- Maureen Dowd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's all this policy change that
says, oh my God, edibles are horrible and
[SPEAKER_03]: we should not have those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or there was a headline in the newspaper
that talked about energy consumption and
[SPEAKER_03]: the environment and environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they had all of these policy
changes that were really harmful to the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry because it was headline driven
and not data driven.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my role is to really provide some
numbers and some context of what the
[SPEAKER_03]: impact of the policies are on the industry
or to really size the industry in such a
[SPEAKER_03]: way that it's understandable for the
policymakers and takes a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: emotion out of the policymaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anybody, before we move on to our
next question that we all agreed that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were gonna answer, do any of you wanna
comment on what's been said so far?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I think one thing that's
probably very important, and I think there
[SPEAKER_04]: were sessions about it before,
but bringing cannabis also to the table is
[SPEAKER_04]: probably, especially in Germany,
very much depending on the next election.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, in four weeks or four and a
half weeks, we are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the moment, I really have the
feeling that there's a change of mindset
[SPEAKER_04]: all over Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that helps us a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the funny thing is when I'm saying
that, I don't only mean that left wing
[SPEAKER_04]: parties are currently on the rise.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also, even within the conservative
parties, we see these changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this next election can really
be a pilot for whole Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: If Germany decides to open up for model
regions, there will be a lot of European
[SPEAKER_04]: countries following because many of them
always wait of what Germany is doing as
[SPEAKER_04]: the center of the European economy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think at the moment, the time for
having a seat on the table cannot be
[SPEAKER_04]: better than right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think part of what I was talking about
yesterday is I feel like Germany is really
[SPEAKER_01]: positioned well to lead Europe and the
world, but you have to start looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: yourselves that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buying American media, making sure we know
who you are, because you know who we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think it would be a good thing
for the Germans to step up and lead the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think your market's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's more people using cannabis in
Germany than admitting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine if we got everybody to tell the
truth and the economists could tell us
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're right and that all these people
are using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could be powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Georg, if you had a magic wand and you
could change something in the industry or
[SPEAKER_01]: in lobbying or in the rules that would
move us forward, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my wish would be that at once in a
Big Bang, everybody would get involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who wants really the cannabis policy to
get forward, to get to legalization?
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen here at the ACPC in Berlin a
couple of years long, a lot of companies
[SPEAKER_07]: sitting around doing nothing, don't
support any legalized lobbyism,
[SPEAKER_07]: just concentrate on their own little
business and little thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's the same for the private people.
[SPEAKER_07]: If millions of cannabis consumers in
Germany would at once go on the streets,
[SPEAKER_07]: make huge demonstrations or support their
association, click at the right moment at
[SPEAKER_07]: the right side and so on, if they all
would get involved in one Big Bang at the
[SPEAKER_07]: same time, companies and people we would
have legalization in the next week done.
[SPEAKER_07]: So look at yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Think about maybe putting 10% of your
budget for advertisement into your
[SPEAKER_07]: favorite lobby organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love action items.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he just basically gave us was the
solution, which is, I think everyone went,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10%, but whatever that number is,
give something to a lobbying organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: My daughter, who used to be here in the...
Oh, there she is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or no, that's not her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, she was working as an intern for a
group that used to register voters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what she did one summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: She broke all kinds of records.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not partisan.
[SPEAKER_01]: She wasn't trying to register Democrats or
Republicans, just voters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they did have a little bend on it and
it was, if you could be 17, you can vote
[SPEAKER_01]: at 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there was a birthday cutoff and if
you were 17 after a certain date,
[SPEAKER_01]: that meant that you were gonna be 18 at
the time of the election.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they know that young voters vote for
cannabis and they know that young voters
[SPEAKER_01]: vote for the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the things that they wanted to pass,
they knew if they could get more young
[SPEAKER_01]: voters to vote, they could get their...
They were reverse engineering the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: What he's basically saying is,
let's reverse engineer the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's figure out how do you all give five
euros, let's say, per month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I learned from this was it was
better to give five euros per month,
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 euros, than it was to give 60 euros.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those organizations need to budget
and they can't budget if all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: you give them 200 euros or 100,000 euros.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to have that monthly budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody in here, if you did a monthly
budget and gave some money to your
[SPEAKER_01]: lobbying organization, the people and the
government, we could move mountains as an
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would your comment be, Finn,
if you had a magic wand?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I would have a magic wand,
I think the first thing I would do is to
[SPEAKER_04]: take cannabis out of the German Narcotics
Drug Law or the BTMG, as many Germans of
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason for that is because I think
that's the problem of so many things.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you only look from the medical
perspective, prescription via digital
[SPEAKER_04]: health, like e-receipt, like everything
that's electronic, is not possible because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's part of the narcotics drug law.
[SPEAKER_04]: Similar to, if you think about model
regions or legalization, always the BTMG
[SPEAKER_04]: is the big bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also for, we talked about it earlier,
THC in food, the limits you can have.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all actually focused on the German
Narcotics Drug Law.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think taking out cannabis out of
that would open up a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunities to actually really change
something for cannabis in Germany and then
[SPEAKER_04]: hopefully successively in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Merijn, magic wand, what would you change?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I would definitely say that's a
major change that we all need.
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, what Finn already mentioned
is I think we need to get a higher THC
[SPEAKER_09]: level for foods because the limits they
have proposed now are so low that we
[SPEAKER_09]: actually cannot sell hemp oil anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the scientific bases worldwide are
much more advanced.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that the levels can be much,
much higher.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those levels are actually at the basis
for having a healthy agricultural
[SPEAKER_09]: production of hemp in Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the basis for everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we want to do something with hemp,
we need to be able to grow it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if the requirements for the products
are still so low that you cannot sell it
[SPEAKER_09]: afterwards, then nobody has the incentive
to grow it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we should work there primarily
and just adhere to what other countries in
[SPEAKER_09]: the world already found out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's for us the main focus
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then from there, the education will
take its own loop.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as soon as farmers start, the rest
will follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have so much I want to say about that as
an edibles company, but this isn't about
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you change if you had a magic
wand?
[SPEAKER_03]: If we had a magic wand, I think we would
really focus on clearing up a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so much murkiness in regulatory
policies that it's inhibiting the growth
[SPEAKER_03]: of the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, even though hemp is legal in
the United States, there's so much
[SPEAKER_03]: uncertainty because the regulators are
treating it as though it's an illegal
[SPEAKER_03]: product still that investment is not
flowing in as much into the industry and
[SPEAKER_03]: the like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the infrastructural development is
being inhibited.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same thing applies on the higher THC
side where there's regulatory uncertainty,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's lack of banking, there's high
taxes to the point where they're taxing
[SPEAKER_03]: people out of the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So clearing up that regulatory uncertainty
and the murkiness would be very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very high on the list.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can only adhere to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's also in Europe,
it's highly essential.
[SPEAKER_09]: We see we have problems with paying
service, banking, insurance.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of bureaucracy that needs
to be getting out of the way in order to
[SPEAKER_09]: make it much more easy for people to start
working in the industry, to have less
[SPEAKER_09]: hurdles, to have more certainty that goes
from the investment to the farmers,
[SPEAKER_09]: to the processors and to the retailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we get it less murky?
[SPEAKER_09]: We should all get together, combine and be
loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go back to that giving five euros a
month thing for the lobbyists comes back
[SPEAKER_01]: full circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finn, what would you like to add?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, the thing is, I'm sometimes
wondering what is the better solution,
[SPEAKER_04]: like going out and be loud or actually
what you also described being rather with
[SPEAKER_04]: the politicians in the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what I'm sometimes wondering is
about even though you're allowed,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're outside, there's the big Hanf
Parade in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think many politicians don't listen to
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end, they are the ones making
policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, for example, what some
companies and some associations start
[SPEAKER_04]: doing and I think the Hanfaban did also
very well to do tax systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's like, how would a tax look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's something that's super
interesting because if you can convince
[SPEAKER_04]: politicians that they can earn money with
the legalization, especially after Corona,
[SPEAKER_04]: where a lot of government subsidies went
into the Corona support, every politician
[SPEAKER_04]: right now is looking for money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to poke them a little bit and say,
look, there's a new complete honey pot of
[SPEAKER_04]: money that you can access just by doing
that is something that I think also,
[SPEAKER_04]: yes, get involved and spend more and be
loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think being also in the back doors
and talking directly to authorities or
[SPEAKER_04]: politicians is also a very, very important
factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So policies right now, both in Europe and
in the US seem to be really controlling.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to control what's going on
rather than support the growth and
[SPEAKER_03]: development of a nation industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that controlling is really
something that if policy were to change
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was supportive, then there would be
greater employment, greater economic
[SPEAKER_03]: development, greater offerings on the
medical side, on the industrial side,
[SPEAKER_03]: on the wellness side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think politicians and
policymakers really need to change the way
[SPEAKER_03]: that they view the industry and promote
further growth and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw that in America where... How many
of you are familiar with the Oklahoma
[SPEAKER_01]: market in the US?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two guys, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I flew into Oklahoma City.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got off the airplane, jumped in a cab
and was literally assaulted by billboards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis here, cannabis here, cannabis...
Arrows, turn the corner, go left,
[SPEAKER_01]: two more cannabis dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally, there are more cannabis
dispensaries in Oklahoma than coffee
[SPEAKER_01]: shops, than Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember that I'm sure Nick knows,
but I think it was $5 to get your license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody got a license in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to me, that's the free market,
which is a conservative value.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you let the free market speak,
the people that make it win and the people
[SPEAKER_01]: who run shitty businesses lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just basically, you bring all
the tax money in that comes from selling a
[SPEAKER_01]: ton of product and you figure out who's
running a good business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is free market economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you lower the barrier to entry and
Oklahoma has a really nice market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's working and people are getting
cannabis and that's the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Georg, what would you like to add to the
conversation around opening this all up?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I would like to add when I'm talking
to you, it's not about five euros a month
[SPEAKER_07]: and not about 60 a year, which is exactly
our usual tariff for private members.
[SPEAKER_07]: But here, I'm talking to companies,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a joke for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really meant what I said, 10% of your
advertisement budget.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the numbers.
[SPEAKER_07]: How much is that?
[SPEAKER_07]: There are little shops, maybe you can just
spend 1000 euros for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then spend 100 euros.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you are a bigger company and you
have the ability to spend 100,000 euros
[SPEAKER_07]: for advertisement, think about giving
10,000 to your lobby organization.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then we will move the mountains,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The point I was trying to make is that
they should budget it on a monthly basis
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can budget it on a monthly basis
and not just write you one check.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll take the money any way you can get
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just giving them that piece of
information that I learned from the
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we have about 15 minutes
left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to open up questions to the
audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to continue here if there are
no questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we jump into the next topic,
what I want to do is find out what's
[SPEAKER_01]: brewing in your heads out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anybody that is wanting to talk
to us?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we have one in the back.
I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Shizuka Pai.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work for Supercritical Brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a marketing and branding agency
focused on the global cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we run a network in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: called Highly Capitalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, it's called what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly Capitalized Network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone would like to be interviewed
and get exposure to key stakeholders in
[SPEAKER_00]: the U.S., please come speak to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm new to the industry, at least
professionally, and I've got a few
[SPEAKER_00]: observations being completely new and it's
my first conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first observation is we've got this
real gold rush kind of culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And secondly, I haven't heard a lot about
consumers at all in the conference so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumer needs states, the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: After all, they're the ones who are making
everyone rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be interesting maybe to have more
discussion around consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the third observation is that I've
heard a lot of people talk about ethical
[SPEAKER_00]: values and wanting a different type of
industry and not copying what the others
[SPEAKER_00]: industries have done and trying to reverse
engineer.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question to the panel is have you
thought about a kind of a charter,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe also one voice for the industry
instead of lots of different cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: associations, one voice with a kind of
ethical charter where we say we would like
[SPEAKER_00]: a different sort of industry with certain
fair trade, sustainability, equal
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the things which probably our
consumers in our industry would very much
[SPEAKER_00]: like and would help differentiate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can someone close that door, please?
[SPEAKER_01]: That low-level noise is probably not great
for the recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Finn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean a lot of different questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I tried to answer two of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is I fully agree with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have too many associations and I think
we should combine those and really be the
[SPEAKER_04]: one voice instead of having too many
different ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a big problem and Georg said
in the beginning that there are also
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis companies who are against
legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that actually confuses the whole
perception of cannabis companies in the
[SPEAKER_04]: public and also towards politicians.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, you cannot change their opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least the ones who have the same
opinion, they should be together and fight
[SPEAKER_04]: for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second thing that I actually agree
with you completely is what you call the
[SPEAKER_04]: charter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with our association Pro CBD,
I mean CBD is a fraction of the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis market, but what for example we
did, we did like a kind of charter where
[SPEAKER_04]: we said this is the rules we want to play
by.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what kind of analytics do we use when
we say this is the percentage of CBD you
[SPEAKER_04]: find in the product?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you wouldn't believe how much
variation there is in oils that say 10%
[SPEAKER_04]: and then suddenly you find an oil that is
in the reality 12% and someone doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: even have CBD in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the second thing, how you advertise
and what kind of promises you make to the
[SPEAKER_04]: customers is something where we also have
a self-regulatory charter where we say if
[SPEAKER_04]: there's no proof in science for it,
don't even mention it in your advertising.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that's just two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole charter is I think 15 points,
but I think that is something if we want
[SPEAKER_04]: to be taken serious as a cannabis industry
and also not only be taken serious by our
[SPEAKER_04]: customers and patients, but also by the
authorities, we have to grow up as an
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And growing up as an industry means that
we also have to have self-cleaning
[SPEAKER_04]: elements in terms of like differentiating
the good and serious companies in the
[SPEAKER_04]: market from, and let's all be honest,
there are some black sheep in the market
[SPEAKER_04]: because those black sheep very often
determine on how patients and customers
[SPEAKER_04]: and authorities look at the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this charter saying this is
the rules we play by is something very
[SPEAKER_04]: important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I full heartedly agree with what you
just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both Morain and Bo want to comment on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to start with Morain.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll keep it short.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think another very important point you
mentioned is consumer safety.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's the final point where all
of our efforts result.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the end, it should be safe for
everybody, for industry players,
[SPEAKER_09]: for consumers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that should be the basis for
all kind of regulations and policies that
[SPEAKER_09]: are made.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we believe that those rules should be
by scientific standards where we all get
[SPEAKER_09]: together and let dogmas and old paradigms
out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because in the end, it's for safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you let experts set those
levels, because what we see happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, is that you have politicians
setting levels and they don't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll set levels like you said in the
hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to allow the industry to have
a voice to set the levels to determine
[SPEAKER_01]: what's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what were you going to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the early days of the cannabis
movement, say 2014 in the legalization,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was a lot of competing policies,
a lot of competing interests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when politicians would get all of
these different perspectives, they
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't know who to believe or what was
important and like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so just as though there's a
consolidation in some states of
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses, there's been a consolidation
in advocacy groups in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, although there are differences
from one group to the next, they're
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to align on key issues such as
banking, such as taxation, such as social
[SPEAKER_03]: justice and the like, so that they
represent the industry in a unified voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a second comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned the gold rush or the green
rush.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been a significant obstacle for the
industry to overcome because policymakers
[SPEAKER_03]: seem to think that with this gold rush
comes all of this money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so part of the education that we do is
educating that very few people in the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry are actually making profits and
making money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that education and that aha moment for
the politicians will help them temper
[SPEAKER_03]: their enthusiasm about taxation and
implementing these rules that are rather
[SPEAKER_03]: draconian or overbearing when it comes to
compliance and all these other costs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the gold rush has really been one of
those things that has been difficult for
[SPEAKER_03]: us to overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the people that are here didn't
see the very first presentation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Global Investment Forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was eye opening when you see the
billions of dollars that are being
[SPEAKER_01]: hemorrhaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: These companies are losing money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are they there?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're investing forward because we know
eventually we'll have an industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll make money.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one question.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Michael Merkley and I have an
agricultural scientific background and I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: working at the moment with industrial
hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I see directly at the universities how
hard is it to work with industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like I need license from the big farm
to work with industrial hemp in
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I talked to a lot of other colleagues
and they want to work with cannabis but
[SPEAKER_06]: there's also money.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the bureaucracy is so hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm asking how do you see it in the next
years if we have to some improvements and
[SPEAKER_06]: from a scientific view you have the
possibility to make research in it which
[SPEAKER_06]: is the basic for the politicians and all
the time that we can improve all the
[SPEAKER_06]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: His question is how do we get these
politicians to stop treating cannabis like
[SPEAKER_08]: yellow cake uranium and how to treat it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a plant because you have to jump
through so many hoops just to work with
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well I think thank you for your question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I cannot agree more with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of the big hurdles.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's what Finn said.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to get it out of the narcotics law
at the beginning because that's the
[SPEAKER_09]: biggest stone on the road there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's our job to show
politicians or policymakers that in
[SPEAKER_09]: science in research lies the potential of
this plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know a lot already but we don't know
enough and especially not how we can
[SPEAKER_09]: introduce it or implement it in already
existing industries or how we can change
[SPEAKER_09]: them for the better using this plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think a lot of people are waiting
for these moments to happen to open up the
[SPEAKER_09]: floodgates of more research money of
easing up bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's one of the main points also for
our association to to battle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finn Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the beginning I mentioned to you that
I'm a member of the conservative party so
[SPEAKER_04]: very often I consider myself a kind of
Trojan horse.
[SPEAKER_04]: So because they probably still think about
me as a not so cannabis person in the like
[SPEAKER_04]: in the comparison.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to give you an example so the
left wing party in Germany the link the
[SPEAKER_04]: linker they brought in like a paper to the
parliament that they want to actually redo
[SPEAKER_04]: the whole legislation around industrial
hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the limit should go from zero point two
to zero point three and CBD should be
[SPEAKER_04]: always legal when it's from industrial
hemp and so on and so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the CDU was calling me and said
do you want to be a speaker in the
[SPEAKER_04]: parliament hearing about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously the city you wanted me to
take a more conservative stand on
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead of doing it myself which I
could have done I was actually introducing
[SPEAKER_04]: three conservative farmers who have been
CDU members for the last 50 years to them
[SPEAKER_04]: who are growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these three farmers were actually
going crazy to the parliamentarians and
[SPEAKER_04]: like the way how you treat us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really with the bureaucracy and with
the administration you're really killing
[SPEAKER_04]: our business.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the CDU the party was shocked about
how their own voters who are conservative
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers were against their stand on on on
on industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I loved it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it shows that it's not this
classic left wing right wing question
[SPEAKER_04]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually for many farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a question of of the future of the
business.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think by actually breaking off these
typical or these are against cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: these are for cannabis but really bringing
more of those Troyan horses in who are
[SPEAKER_04]: actually fighting for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's actually a really good
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the industrial hemp farmers I think
there are so many conservative among them
[SPEAKER_04]: to actually activate them and send them to
the party and to the local
[SPEAKER_04]: parliamentarians and let them tell them
how important industrial hemp for them is
[SPEAKER_04]: as farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that is also something that will
change how politicians perceive industrial
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can everybody please give Finn a hand for
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's magic right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got another one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got another one over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been waiting for a while too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it's a quick question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my opinion one of the big
differences between the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and Germany is that in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: you have celebrities that are being a
voice for the cannabis industry Martha
[SPEAKER_02]: Stewart Snoop Doggy Dog Rihanna Seth Rogen
just named there everywhere there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that it's now a question to
the German associations and also to
[SPEAKER_02]: companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that this would be possible
in Germany or do you want them even to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could react straight away because if you
follow sanity group a bit in the press we
[SPEAKER_04]: have celebrity investors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example well I am is invested in us
but also Mario Goetze the soccer star and
[SPEAKER_04]: Andre Scherle who has also been part of
the national German soccer team.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is you know I have this
discussion with them quite frequently and
[SPEAKER_04]: they are not as open as their American
counterparts to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example when Mario Goetz invested
he was really interested in the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: side of the business and then the built
newspaper like the biggest German
[SPEAKER_04]: Boulevard newspaper make the big headline
is Mario Goetz a high question mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's now investing in cannabis and then he
called me and he was really shaken saying
[SPEAKER_04]: oh my God the anti-doping agency will be
in front of my door just by tomorrow
[SPEAKER_04]: because now they are thinking I consume
cannabis and I have the feeling that
[SPEAKER_04]: celebrities in Germany also in Europe in
general are still very conservative
[SPEAKER_04]: compared to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: counterparts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it help if they take a public stand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely because people are listening to
what these guys saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what for example the whole influencers
on Instagram and everyone people are
[SPEAKER_04]: really following and if Mario Goetz would
stand there in the public and say I like
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis and I use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe so many people who are as
followers would think like oh wow it can't
[SPEAKER_04]: be that bad if that serious guy is doing
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean we are trying that this is one
of the reasons why we took those celebrity
[SPEAKER_04]: investors on board.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can tell you it's really hard to
convince them to publicly be the advocate
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think unfortunately as a society we
are not there yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you have this brick in the wall I
think it will fall down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you need the first five to ten
celebrities who are well known who are
[SPEAKER_04]: really also not the usual suspect to go to
the front and say like yes I'm for
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anybody here know Tony Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get him in our.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you get him to join.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I think if he came forward it's a
wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the whole world then right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've only got a minute left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you the next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll be here for the next ICBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's try it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so hello everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Luke.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a filmmaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got introduced to cannabis by seeing the
the human rights potential witnessing
[SPEAKER_05]: villages in Nepal quickly and a medical
patients using RSO for basically escaping
[SPEAKER_05]: his death bed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was my introduction and ever since
I've been filming voices from very like
[SPEAKER_05]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So short comment there's so much
potential.
[SPEAKER_05]: Question is the question is is needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question is after the comment.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we how do we gather all the
knowledge here only from this room.
[SPEAKER_05]: The financial means the connections the
wisdom the experience the medical data and
[SPEAKER_05]: we have a lot of data we learn this today
in order to spread what this conference
[SPEAKER_05]: hall is already knowing on cannabis to our
fellow humans because when we step outside
[SPEAKER_05]: from this hotel we having a pandemic we
have a health crisis we have an economic
[SPEAKER_05]: crisis and everyone here in this room
knows perfectly that this one beautiful
[SPEAKER_05]: plan provides more than 30 thousand
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is you have your answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Georg Georg told us we give 10 percent of
our economic money to lobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other the other fact of the matter
is ICBC is doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that ICBC brought all of us here
and we're all getting on the same page.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like when the parents go behind the
door and they get on the same page before
[SPEAKER_01]: they scold the child.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting on the same page and we're
going to go talk to our politicians and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to talk to each other and
we're going to stop pretending that we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to come out of the closet and
you're going to speak the truth and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to fight the stigma.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're fighting.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're fighting against almost 100 years of
anti-cannabis propaganda.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now we're fighting the clock
because we have to be done.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are fighting the clock.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I appreciate you for being prompt and
punctual.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it for Jamie Pearson,
Bo Whitney, Marianne Finn and Yorg.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fantastic.
