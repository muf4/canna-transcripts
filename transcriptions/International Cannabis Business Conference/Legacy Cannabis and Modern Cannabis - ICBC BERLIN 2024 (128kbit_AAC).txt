[SPEAKER_08]: Legacy cannabis and modern cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of tension, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because outlaws don't want to fill out
paperwork.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're going to have a whole panel
about it and to lead us in this
[SPEAKER_08]: discussion, the head of research for
alcoholic drinks and cannabis for the Euro
[SPEAKER_08]: Monitor International, please welcome
Spiros Valandrakis.
[SPEAKER_08]: One, two, one, two.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you've had a bit of time to digest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit less busy than before,
but I'm sure many more will be arriving
[SPEAKER_02]: very shortly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Spiros Valandrakis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lead the research for alcoholic drinks
and cannabis at Euro Monitor
[SPEAKER_02]: International.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I wanted to also clarify earlier that
the alcohol industry is not actually
[SPEAKER_02]: against cannabis in any way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take my word on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them are looking at it as a great
opportunity rather than something to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a bit of paranoia in the
cannabis industry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that out of the way, I would like
my esteemed friends here to introduce
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves one by one before we have the
conversation, which I'm sure is
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting for everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Jorge Sanchez, better known as
Waxplug in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the co-founder of Chemtech and founder
of Waxplug Academy, which is a platform
[SPEAKER_04]: for teaching courses on how to do
extractions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Been in the industry for about eight
years, extracting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a pleasure to be here and share
with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Andrew Friedman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm known as the Cannabis Somalier.
[SPEAKER_00]: People know me around the world for
helping teach people to pair cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: wine together and build those parallels in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very fortunate to be the author of
Turpenes for Wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And won an International Publishers Award
amazingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to learn more about
Turpenes, please check out the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm the CEO of Cannabis Tolling
Solutions in Edmonton, Alberta,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make vape pens and diamonds and sauce
and infused pre-roll input for about 55
[SPEAKER_00]: skews across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been selling weed my entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am truly a legacy to legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really humbled to be on this panel
with such amazing guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm looking forward to having
the discussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Marcus Richardson, AKA the
Bubble Man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of claim to fame is that I helped
pioneer water extraction, coined the term
[SPEAKER_06]: bubble hash back in the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_06]: And have just done a ton of stuff since
then in the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have an LP as well in Canada that we
produce and do white labeling and do
[SPEAKER_06]: branding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I have the Bubble Man brand
that's in a bunch of different states
[SPEAKER_06]: right now across the US.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just also very happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy to be here with these guys on the
panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully we get into some good
convos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, I'm Tyler Kearns, owner and CEO of
Seven Leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in the industry since 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually grew up in the industry,
up in Humboldt as a child.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now Seven Leaves is a indoor
cultivator we harvest every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have about 450 locations in California,
some in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited to be on the panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with these folks as well and hear your
discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I wanted to ask them these
questions in the beginning and introduce
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves as we were having the
conversation earlier in the green room as
[SPEAKER_02]: well, it was a realization that the
stories, all the great stories that these
[SPEAKER_02]: guys have to share are essentially a
glimpse or a snapshot of the narrative of
[SPEAKER_02]: this transition they were talking about
from the legacy markets into the fully
[SPEAKER_02]: branded legal market of the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to start with asking
everyone the question of, what is the role
[SPEAKER_02]: of stigma that already in the previous
panel, we kind of heard already that even
[SPEAKER_02]: in legal markets, even in Canada,
after seven years of realization,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is still not gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you see that evolving or changing
over time in Canada or North American
[SPEAKER_02]: markets that you're much more familiar
with or potentially even in Germany?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your prediction about moving away
from this kind of cannabis bad?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the devil's lettuce kind of
approach that still haunts some segments
[SPEAKER_02]: of society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd love to go first if nobody
minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been really fortunate to be an
ambassador of culinary cannabis all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea of the Cannabis Somalia was
really to take the parallel of wine,
[SPEAKER_00]: a multiple thousand year old industry and
show people that cannabis was really a
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar product from the people,
the places, even the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the trichome head being a
glandular head and a circle, same with the
[SPEAKER_00]: grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: One you light on fire, one you have to
ferment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you deal with those intoxicating
values and you have that same discussion,
[SPEAKER_00]: but back at the dinner table, it's a
really great way to start pushing that
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's a huge debate between
combustible cannabis and reduced risk or
[SPEAKER_00]: like a vaporized product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we focus on making those 2.0,
those vaporized products, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with less smell, with less interruption to
somebody's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really easy way to break down that
stigma, have medical value and an
[SPEAKER_00]: intoxicating value, however you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, like Marcus said, civil
disobedience is the best way to break
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll let him talk about that,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I mean stigma is a tough one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It came over a hundred year period of
propaganda that was like influenced
[SPEAKER_06]: massively by Hollywood, who of course is
exporting their stories all around the
[SPEAKER_06]: world.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look back, you know, 30 to 40 years
ago and you look how cannabis was
[SPEAKER_06]: portrayed in any TV show, in any movie,
it was always the brain dead stoner.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was always like, hey, hey, what do you
mean, man?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was always this really negative
stereotype.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they always did was they always
honed in on the most magical medicinal
[SPEAKER_06]: benefits of cannabis and then turned them
into stereotypes and negativities.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I'm eating AIDS medication and I'm
dying of wasting syndrome, I can use
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis to increase my appetite.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's called the munchies,
ha ha ha.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's sort of belittling.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it took a hundred years of massive
propaganda to make cannabis as illegal as
[SPEAKER_06]: it was and the stigma to be as strong as
it was.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's gonna take nearly as
long because we pass information so much
[SPEAKER_06]: quicker today.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in Germany in particular, you know,
Germans are very staunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of Germans that are like,
it's illegal, I'm not touching it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it'll take some of those people a
little bit longer before, I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: listen, all you have to do is get a little
bit older and realize how much it can take
[SPEAKER_06]: away your pain and reduce inflammation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it doesn't matter what you
believed at one point in your life.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're sold and you're taking it for the
rest of your life.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tyler Hawke, your opinions about the
de-stigmatization?
[SPEAKER_01]: The stigma is real.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think on the getting from the plant
stigma to the business stigma,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's important to, I guess, with with
Seven Leads and MTG, we come almost go
[SPEAKER_01]: over the top to be as efficient as a
business as possible, to make every phone
[SPEAKER_01]: call back, to never be late, to never show
up to a meeting with red eyes,
[SPEAKER_01]: because then you get the jokes,
you know, immediately come.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, they're five minutes late.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably in the parking lot token,
you know, and really trying to combat it,
[SPEAKER_01]: to combat the stigma constantly with good
business practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: With with not having advertising that that
falls victim to the Hollywood stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: he was just speaking of, trying to keep it
as professional as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, yes, now it is a billion dollar
business and it needs to have still needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to be hip and have that that feel that you
get when you're high, but also having the
[SPEAKER_01]: professionalism to counter the stigma and
to then have that be a word of mouth chain
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you know what, we did do a real
estate state deal with these guys in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry and it worked out great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were very professional, very smooth
and very understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just slowly chisels away at that
very large sculpture that is the stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make a comment to the hardest
transition for me, especially as a CEO,
[SPEAKER_00]: has been gaining the acumen and
professionalism of a CEO in a billion
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I sold weed my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so spending the last 10 years as an
entrepreneur in this business,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to pair with Tyler said,
has been hard and to get that level up and
[SPEAKER_00]: to present that to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also still do like doing business
the most in a parking lot over a joint
[SPEAKER_00]: with with weed guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody's got a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually agree with everything they
said.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just want to point one thing out
is in my experience in the industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen a lot of the stigmas come.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're inevitable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you're going to be creating
products, you're going to encounter some
[SPEAKER_04]: of these things as you go through the
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really comes down to a battle of
just really up to all of us here in
[SPEAKER_04]: Germany to make sure that we educate
people as much as we can through education
[SPEAKER_04]: is where we're going to be able to break
these stigmas and show people that a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of them are false or just misinformation
being spread for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I mean, I agree with what
everything everyone said.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just making sure that you share as
much as education as possible to not allow
[SPEAKER_04]: that overflow into here.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of them are already kind of proven
wrong since we've done a lot of research
[SPEAKER_04]: already in, say, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: and Canada side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I believe here in Germany,
it shouldn't be too much of a problem as
[SPEAKER_04]: long as education is readily available for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are all great points.
[SPEAKER_02]: I obviously agree with everything that was
said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Education is a core pillar of all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're starting that and starting with
your stories, how did you transition from
[SPEAKER_02]: the legacy market to the legal market,
the problems or the lens that you had in
[SPEAKER_02]: this process, the whole kind of central
point of stigma in this conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next one for me, the question that
I think everyone would be interested to
[SPEAKER_02]: hear about, what is your take on the
German market and the legislation as it
[SPEAKER_02]: appears to start being formulated right
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see it as a positive?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you optimistic about the next stages
of its evolution?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you expect to happen in the next
three to five years in Germany when it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to this transition?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can start with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can take it all the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, I see it's kind of like going
back in a time machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's in U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from California.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: side, we started with Prop 215,
which was kind of like semi-legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe it's kind of like what most
governments are going to do to kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: test the waters and get a feel for the
market first.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to happen kind of like the
same, you know, evolved throughout the
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: As the education comes along.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe, I mean, yeah, I mean,
it's going to evolve, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: for the German market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to really blow up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of companies now that are
established, the industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot more mature.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot more equipment available
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe it's a good time for Germany
to legalize and introduce all these
[SPEAKER_04]: companies and products into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The policy, any forward policy is good
policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Government never works quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who's lobbied understands that any
time somebody wants to parrot one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas, especially when it goes all the way
to passing a legal bill for legalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a massive, massive step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a fanatic about critiquing
legalization in the rollout in different
[SPEAKER_00]: states within Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to constantly remind myself,
any progress is good progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have the opportunity to have
regulated businesses and talk about this
[SPEAKER_00]: in an open and normal and professional
format.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big win.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as far as you see, do you see that in
Germany as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I got here, I smoked a cigar in the
lounge and the guy was like, you can smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: a joint if you want us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, this is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the plane, the woman behind me,
as I mentioned, I was going to a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: conference, said, oh, no, you shouldn't,
shouldn't mention that so loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, you know, it's so
interesting to see the destigmatization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the reality of what's going to
happen in Germany, because the social club
[SPEAKER_00]: rollout maybe won't be the best model,
that's probably where the bottleneck's
[SPEAKER_00]: about to exist in your new framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be lots of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be lots of extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be really hard to actually pertain
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the medical system is the one
where you're going to see a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: traction, just like in the early 2010s in
Canada, with doctors signing different
[SPEAKER_00]: prescriptions and having more of a mail
order cannabis system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of my prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think we're from Canada,
there's Canadians, North Americans,
[SPEAKER_00]: California, like we're in Germany because
of legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a huge win.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the bubble mistake?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, I also agree with Andrew in
the sense that any forward motion is a
[SPEAKER_06]: win.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a long time to move these things
forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing that I'm the most happy
about is the shift in power, where the
[SPEAKER_06]: German police will lose power and the
German people will gain power.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you allow cannabis to be legal,
the smell of cannabis will no longer
[SPEAKER_06]: legally be a reason for the police to be
able to search you.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to carry scales around
with them and weigh what you have.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just going to... Even though
there's regulations and rules,
[SPEAKER_06]: those rules and regulations will become
looser and looser because the minute they
[SPEAKER_06]: open Pandora's box, you can't close it
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The progress is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it can be learned from other
countries, other states like California
[SPEAKER_01]: that have gone legal is... And this is in
regards to the whole EU, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical market right now in the EU is
about 230 million, with expected growth to
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe two or three billion in the next few
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the illicit market right now is eight
to 12 billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something going legal is great
progress, but it doesn't wipe away the
[SPEAKER_01]: massive market that exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really... The key is finding a way
to transition that customer to the new
[SPEAKER_01]: legal market so that you don't have
naysayers say, look, the legal market
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The illicit market's thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have two issues to handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I firmly believe that it takes a few
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, basically, comfort for that person,
convenience, trust, and price.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for the customer that was spending
the eight to 12 billion in the illicit
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, they need to have that comfort when
they go into the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to learn something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to feel good about the purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to have convenience.
[SPEAKER_01]: This needs to be easier than calling their
connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have to have trust that the
product is what it is, what it says,
[SPEAKER_01]: what it was tested, and that the price is
within reason of what they were getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in California, we had a huge market
already and then rolled this over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have 40% tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, hey, I'll just get it
from my friend that grows in their
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have the big investment that
took place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't pay back the investments.
[SPEAKER_01]: The illicit market's thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the legal market's basically
subsidizing themselves with the illicit
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think if you transition the
operators as opposed to trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: transition the customers, you would have
had more success as the operators are
[SPEAKER_00]: already fulfilling their market share?
[SPEAKER_00]: With California, that was the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already had the operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had four times as many operators as
we had retail outlets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So California's producing about five times
more product every day than is sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That same bottleneck's going to happen
here because of the clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I really think in Germany
and the EU in general, it's making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's enough convenience,
retail outlets, social clubs, whatever the
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing process is, is making sure that
there's enough of those per demographic,
[SPEAKER_01]: per municipality, and that the country or
the country's government has the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: In California, the local municipalities
trump the state licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have different local municipalities
that just said, no, we don't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we took away the convenience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already heard about the Bavarian fear
earlier in a couple of panels,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's in the conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would take this couple of mention
that you guys made already and ask you the
[SPEAKER_02]: next questions would be, what are your
major fears when it comes to the potential
[SPEAKER_02]: downfalls for the, I wouldn't even call it
legalization, the decriminalization
[SPEAKER_02]: process in Germany at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the things that really you think
could go really wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, for me, the abstract nature
of some of the legislation when it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: to the social clubs, the limitations,
the fact that a lot of the wheat that will
[SPEAKER_02]: be produced there will not be of the
quality that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: The questions about how they actually make
a profit because they have to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: profit somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially forcing them to use
sideways threats to actually make that
[SPEAKER_02]: profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The limits when it comes to 100 meters
from schoolyards.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these kind of issues are major
alarm bells in my head about how that can
[SPEAKER_02]: be derailed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, of course, in my mind,
politics is something that hasn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: been discussed.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind, according to the latest
information we have, the governing
[SPEAKER_02]: coalition most likely will lose power in
the next election, which is not very far
[SPEAKER_02]: away.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would happen with the next
government?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would they continue down that path or
could they potentially use the
[SPEAKER_02]: shortcomings of this law to actually
postpone any other meaningful change down
[SPEAKER_02]: the line?
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the kind of questions in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be the things that kind of
worry you most about the changes now,
[SPEAKER_02]: if there are any?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can start again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, like in the US, when I look
over there, we have a lot of issues with
[SPEAKER_04]: just the government.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're setting a really high tax or they
just put rules that don't make sense for
[SPEAKER_04]: us as producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it almost impossible for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really the biggest fear is just
that whoever's in charge of making the
[SPEAKER_04]: laws and regulations, that they don't make
them uneducated, like make them just
[SPEAKER_04]: throwing things out there, because that's
a lot of the things that happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all notice coming from the process
inside that whoever's making these laws is
[SPEAKER_04]: lacking some education in how the things
are made.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we were able to maybe establish a
connection there to help these lawmakers
[SPEAKER_04]: make better decisions, I think that can be
avoided, because that's mainly the biggest
[SPEAKER_04]: problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he was saying that we have a black
market that's thriving in California and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's because of that, because the laws
make it really hard for the legal market
[SPEAKER_04]: to thrive and compete with the black
market who doesn't have any of these
[SPEAKER_04]: restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think laws are very hard to reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also very hard to enact.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of people who are now very
passionate and have put their bet in on
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you need to worry about a
new party coming in and changing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what you may see is actually a
more, a better approach where they see
[SPEAKER_00]: some pieces of the system broken and
affect quicker and more accurate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last five years of legalization
in Canada, we've had quite poorly written
[SPEAKER_00]: policy, put a lot of handcuffs on
movement, specifically like I make
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that legalization 2.0 in Canada
because they had to write it into the law
[SPEAKER_00]: three years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a massive failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's now 27% of market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always outpacing combustibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very important part that should be
introduced right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say, no, I wouldn't worry at
all about my government talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if anyone, you know, I hope this is a
room full of activists like I was,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Marcus was, you need to talk to your
local government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever is your person in local
government, municipal, provincial,
[SPEAKER_00]: state, federal, whatever it is,
you need to actively have conversations
[SPEAKER_00]: with those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: On their website, they all have an
assistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all run for your vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all live in democracies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how this law was passed in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having that open and honest conversation
about your consumption, your family's
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption, your business, is what these
people take to their job at work every day
[SPEAKER_00]: and talk about those people that they
represent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most important thing you can do is
continue that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how these laws don't get
reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it goes only up from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Germany's actually really set a
standard in the centre of the EU with how
[SPEAKER_00]: strict it is that you keep going in this
direction.
So if you have a family member,
if you have a friend, if you have a friend
[SPEAKER_00]: who is here, this was a huge, you know,
not a surprise to me because the rumblings
[SPEAKER_00]: have been going on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of amazing medical
activists here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant and medicine is what gets you to
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And never forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we all look at the opportunity of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people fought for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep fighting for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever that helps you with,
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't look backwards, only forwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I would suggest that people
don't stop with their civil disobedience
[SPEAKER_06]: because Germany didn't just wake up
yesterday or a couple weeks ago and decide
[SPEAKER_06]: that they were going to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, people fought tooth and nail for
that and took that to get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did the same thing in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they won't get it right right away,
but it is forward motion thinking.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the things that bother you... What
happened in Canada, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_06]: which was unfortunate, was that when
people got their licenses, that suddenly
[SPEAKER_06]: they were like, Oh my God, I have a
license to grow cannabis, to process
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, to sell these different
products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it was such a crazy feeling that all
the activists immediately stopped with all
[SPEAKER_06]: of their activism because they were like,
Well, I gotta protect my license.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, this license is worth millions of
dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can sell weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that unfortunate aspect will
probably happen here as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do speak to the true activists in the
crowd.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to maintain your civil
disobedience because none of this was
[SPEAKER_06]: given to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree with what they all said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the German legislation or the
law that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do know is what's happening in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is now we have 26 different legal cannabis
laws because we have states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis is a state's issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's 26 states in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: where legal adult use cannabis can take
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every one of those is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some are drastically different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who can own the licenses, how many
licenses there are, how many licenses
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what could be learned is having
consistencies in the legislation and just
[SPEAKER_01]: taking photos from us as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the federal government legalizes
cannabis, it is going to be a major mess
[SPEAKER_01]: because we already have 26 ways of doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how are those 26 ways going to mold
into this new one way or things like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So staying consistent and being very
patient with the process because at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the day, it's a great win.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just kind of roll with the punches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And beyond the punches and the activism
and everything that we have to continue
[SPEAKER_02]: doing, as you all said, and I fully agree
with, in terms of more practicalities,
[SPEAKER_02]: you are all veterans of the scene for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've been there from the beginning
until the branded future.
[SPEAKER_02]: What changes in the terms of formats of
products or occasions or the way people
[SPEAKER_02]: consume it, have you witnessed over the
last decade or two?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for example, the transition away
from combustibles that was already
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned, the rise of concentrates,
the potential for edibles or beverages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen specific things that
potentially could also be of relevance to
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone in the audience today,
giving them a glimpse of the future of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis once it finds its way legally?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can start the other way now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily now we're a flower brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our bread and butter industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an indoor flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, four years ago in California,
the extracts and the pins went in game
[SPEAKER_01]: busters, had the best growth, and that
stalled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, still to this day, 65% of sales
in California are flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other fastest growing market is
pre-rolls, rolled up flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we then kind of came back to staying
with flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just seems that, yes, there's all
kinds of wonderful new options.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely agree on the medical side
that the extracts is 100% the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just the data and the sales just keep
showing that combustible flower is not
[SPEAKER_01]: going anywhere, at least in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I would completely agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say from my perspective of really
sort of pioneering water hash back in the
[SPEAKER_06]: very early days that I was around a time
where you saw some dry sift, you saw some
[SPEAKER_06]: pressed hash from Lebanon, and Morocco,
and Afghanistan, and Nepal.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you just didn't see the quality that
suddenly came to be when water extraction
[SPEAKER_06]: came onto the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that sort of opened up the gates.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's taken a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it took a very long time to see it
grow and change.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still a small percentage.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no doubt that flower is king.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in reality, regardless of what it is,
you're always smoking or vaporizing or
[SPEAKER_06]: using the hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the modality of what it is is fine with
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think the future, who can say
what will happen?
[SPEAKER_06]: I also agree with Tyler that flower is not
going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: But extracts will continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so will edibles and beverages.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll just have to hopefully be here
to see it play out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my company makes future weed,
future hash, eweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any way I can describe it to people,
like Marcus said, the modality doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to be able to consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep talking about combustible flower
versus reduced risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just parroting tobacco vernacular,
to be very honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: These products, for me, break down stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy for me to sit on stage,
smoke this pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't intrusive on anybody in the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could barely smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, to me, is what the future of these
products are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can travel around the world
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have them in your pocket very
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada, we see soccer moms enjoying
this instead of a glass of Chardonnay now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of progress to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to Marcus for doing everything
with bubble bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I ever made hash,
I was 16 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched a George Cervantes video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made some pretty bad hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've gotten better at it over the
years, because there are some tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're smoking future weed right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an electronic dab rig with a made
using concentrates that were extracted
[SPEAKER_00]: using really cool machines engineered in
Canada that are using different pressures
[SPEAKER_00]: and different temperatures to take some of
the best parts of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And flowers going nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still love smoking joints every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't smoke a joint in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want every option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just here to deliver those options
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the future for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with what everyone said here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Touching on the point there, I want to
highlight like one of the experiences I
[SPEAKER_04]: had was seeing that, for example,
where the industry is kind of stalling
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the same products all across the
board now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's really not much new things
going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in order for you to push that boundary
forward and create more like future
[SPEAKER_04]: products, you want to think outside of the
box and look at everything as like it's
[SPEAKER_04]: all about wax all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to just be obsessed with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, an example was one time I
remember I was with my girlfriend and we
[SPEAKER_04]: went to the makeup store.
[SPEAKER_04]: She wanted to buy some makeup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while I was looking at the stuff
there, I noticed the consistency was very
[SPEAKER_04]: similar to the extract already.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they just clicked on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I can probably use any of these
containers here to create a whole new
[SPEAKER_04]: product that would be a new way to
consume.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did is I took a lip gloss
container, an empty one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put oil in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it worked perfectly to twist the
bottom and push the oil out to infuse
[SPEAKER_04]: joints.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from there, I came out with a product
called Blunt Brush.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just thinking like that outside of the
box to where everything in your everyday
[SPEAKER_04]: life, you've got to compare it and see,
can I create a similar product to it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because after all, it's still just a
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of plants in the world that
we all use to create different products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got to just stop thinking that
it's something different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can apply it to a lot of the
current market that are out there and
[SPEAKER_04]: create similar products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we covered most of the key points
when it comes to this kind of transition
[SPEAKER_02]: that we talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another personal one because also
of my background in the alcohol industry
[SPEAKER_02]: and realizing a long time ago the
importance of social consumption in
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And social consumption in alcohol was also
what broke the stigma back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibitionary years and the essential
element of beverage as a totemic central
[SPEAKER_02]: point in the ritual of socialization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my question for you would be,
how do you see cannabis playing in that
[SPEAKER_02]: field?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that in North America over the last
couple of years, the first social
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption lounges or on-trade
establishments or whatever we call them
[SPEAKER_02]: started appearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see more of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see it as an essential part of this
transition as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Social consumption, not just smoking
joints or dubs at home with friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: but actually places that facilitate
exactly that, that could be part of this
[SPEAKER_02]: narrative.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in Vegas right now, there's the Nuhu
Club and then there's another club that
[SPEAKER_08]: they just opened and they found that
people love the cannabis drink.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like going to a bar, but you get
the 2% THC, the 5% THC mocktail and you
[SPEAKER_08]: chop it up like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's also smoking lounges.
[SPEAKER_08]: San Francisco is full of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: The rules are tricky everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like in Arizona, you can't buy any
cannabis at the social lounge,
[SPEAKER_08]: but you're allowed to sit there and you
can rent a bar.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a lot of drinks along and they
have exotic overpriced snacks that you can
[SPEAKER_08]: enjoy because you had to pay for it
somehow.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they used to have one in Vancouver
too, where it was like 10 bucks for an
[SPEAKER_08]: hour or 20 bucks for the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Still there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I opened mine in Vancouver in 2003.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the melting point, which was a
vaporization bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love to be able to speak on this
because the importance of us needing to
[SPEAKER_06]: gather and consume together, not as
friends, but as public and strangers,
[SPEAKER_06]: is so important.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how you make friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've spoken to this in the past,
that when alcohol went to pubs and the
[SPEAKER_06]: working labor people would go and enjoy
the beers, those conversations that they
[SPEAKER_06]: had would shape... These are the people
that are building the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their conversations would shape the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And next came the teahouses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now these were intellectuals drinking
teas and the conversations they were
[SPEAKER_06]: having in those teahouses would shape the
world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then came coffee and people are all
overproductive and drinking their coffee
[SPEAKER_06]: and having conversations.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're shaping the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our turn to shape the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna shape the world of snacks and
new ways to kick back.
[SPEAKER_08]: And weed drinks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And weed drinks.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fancy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have maybe three or four minutes left.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you wanna do some questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do people have a question?
[SPEAKER_08]: One person has a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Two people have a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start here and then we'll go to
there and then that'll be it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it for the panel, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to have you all here.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question would be, do you see where is
the reason why German government want to
[SPEAKER_03]: play now this regulation about extracts in
the, for example, in ferrines that it
[SPEAKER_03]: should be solventless, should be just old
school hashish and maybe some hot press,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, no diamonds, no crazy
solvents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see where is the reason for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see those new extracts coming?
[SPEAKER_03]: They are more dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could be, you know, maybe nobody
knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is those extracts you're bringing
from USA, some crazy diamonds with the
[SPEAKER_03]: sources and you know, like shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanna see, you know, natural flower,
real hashish.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when I was last time in Chicago
a few months ago, I was trying to buy some
[SPEAKER_03]: dirty hashish like we smoke here in
Europe, you know, like just like black
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghan or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't even have this, you know,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just need to be educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make real hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make very safe products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run thousands and thousands and
thousands of dollars of lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: To say that the products we make aren't
safe is just a miseducation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understandably that there are other
products that can be solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marcus definitely prefers a solventless
product where I'm a solvent producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both share a lane and there's a lane
for every specific product and product
[SPEAKER_00]: type, and it's important to meet
everybody's demand.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would also say a lot of that has to do
with the optics too, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you're smoking a little hash
joint, you roll it with a non-alcoholic
[SPEAKER_08]: tobacco or whatever, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you see a bunch of guys with
their giant rigs and their fat torches,
[SPEAKER_08]: and they're sitting around zonked out of
their minds, it looks really more like
[SPEAKER_08]: you're doing drugs than it looks like
you're smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of the culture though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not saying that it's a bad thing,
I'm saying it's the optics of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another part of those optics and that
stigma is that there are of course
[SPEAKER_06]: companies that could come in like Andrews
and make completely safe products.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you ever look up like people dying
from hash, it's because they blew up in
[SPEAKER_06]: their house doing it at home the incorrect
way and they created a negative stigma on
[SPEAKER_06]: the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: If Germany is going to catch up to North
America,
[SPEAKER_05]: what are some modernization, what are some
policies that we should be selling to our
[SPEAKER_05]: MLAs, our government representatives?
[SPEAKER_00]: Access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, access.
[SPEAKER_00]: The social club is the bottleneck here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to access the customer,
the patient, what have you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have time for one more question.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a microphone right over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big money will help the growers,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Up there, you see it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a microphone?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just has to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Greetings.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say that I'm an owner of
a laboratory analysis lab and I can
[SPEAKER_07]: confirm that solventless extracts can
match any extracts done with a solvent.
[SPEAKER_07]: So depending on the quality and the
technique applied, it's actually all the
[SPEAKER_07]: same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait until they find out that all of the
terpenes are hydrocarbons in the
[SPEAKER_06]: solventless hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: So solventless is a misnomer at best.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what are they going to do when
they figure that out?
[SPEAKER_06]: When they're like, oh, we're not allowing
solvents.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, D-limonene is a solvent and it's in
my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one thing for everyone to
understand here is that it was mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: in the previous panel that it's not a
pharmaceutical conversation, it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: political conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many of these decisions are not based
on actual pharmaceutical data because the
[SPEAKER_02]: product is the same, but it's on optics,
political optics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking tough on drugs or the fact that
many of these products have a THC content
[SPEAKER_02]: of 80% so it sounds high and let's not
allow people to do this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we have to separate politics
from pharmaceutical background or reality
[SPEAKER_02]: in that sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's always the optics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it again for the panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
