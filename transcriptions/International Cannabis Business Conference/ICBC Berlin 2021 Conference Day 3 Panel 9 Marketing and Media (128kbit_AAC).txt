[SPEAKER_01]: I welcome you to our panel about marketing
and media in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really proud to present or to say
hello to three experts on cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing from different countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with Petra Marinico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm never so sure about the pronunciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Petra is founder and owner of Pharma
Ginibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please tell us what are you doing,
what are you producing, and what's your
[SPEAKER_01]: product in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do food supplements with CBD,
without CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use full spectrum, broad spectrum,
and we have a lot of problems doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We chose a clean path to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use only clean ingredients with no
pesticides, no phenoxyethanol,
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing on the dirty list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we're doing this with CBD,
we have a lot of problems with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's great to be here and talk about
this a bit more with other experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Marina.
[SPEAKER_01]: To my right, we have Mike Weiss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike is a filmmaker, public sponsor.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a speaker, a Gonzo journalist,
a medicine man, as it said in the
[SPEAKER_01]: description.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also know Mike owns a CBD company
and is selling CBD all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, tell us about your company and your
activities, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, I got the shirt on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Labs, genetics, know your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of know what you're putting in your
medicine, like Petra was saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a big part of what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: With my company, I like to say,
we're an activist-driven company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we focus on the activism side.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of companies, pretty much all the
companies, don't sell THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, some sell full spectrum CBD oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: My company, we sell high THC oil,
90, 80% oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't care about laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this for the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if people are sick and dying,
we don't wait and say, hey, wait for the
[SPEAKER_00]: laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: To change, then we'll give you some
medicine that will work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give them something now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: To my left-hand, I can say hello to Juri
Butina.
[SPEAKER_01]: Juri is the CEO of Snell Custom Rolling
Papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most people sitting here know
Snell Custom Rolling Papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please tell me about your company and your
activities in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are making rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we had explained.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are kind of a dinosaur in this
industry, because producing rolling papers
[SPEAKER_03]: has been for over 100 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything here is very new,
less than 10 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are getting banned from all sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are getting banned from the smoking
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are getting banned from the
cannabis side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we cannot promote ourselves anyway,
almost.
[SPEAKER_03]: As many of you know, now the plain tobacco
packaging is arriving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some countries consider rolling papers
to be tobacco accessory.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we are getting afraid that the
possibility of putting a design on rolling
[SPEAKER_03]: papers will not be possible in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some countries already introduced it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is no possibility that a rolling
paper booklet can have a design on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are also struggling a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you know, the ways of consumption
of cannabis also are changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have now edibles, you have vapes,
you have drinks, you have everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are OK, but new things are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Juri.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, cannabis marketing
differs from other marketing strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason is the product is illegal in a
lot of countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's connected to smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Germany or in other countries where
medical cannabis is at least legal,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you are not allowed to advertise for
your product, because as a pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: in the whole EU, you are not allowed to do
normal advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBD in many countries is still
considered as a part of the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and also illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Marina can tell us something
about that, because cannabis CBD marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: in Slovenia is not so easy, is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not allowed to do any marketing
whatsoever, because we cannot claim
[SPEAKER_02]: anything if you have written CBD on social
media, you get banned, and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tried to do it a bit differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it through unique design and tried
to stand out with something that is
[SPEAKER_02]: different on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are selling in DM, drugeriemark
stores in Slovenia, in 95 shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if someone goes to drugeriemark,
they surely notice us, because we differ.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people don't know much about
CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the problem also,
another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it takes a lot of education to tell
people what this does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is really hard, because you
cannot make any claims.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried to do it with different
ingredients we put inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, we have a magnesium lotion
with CBD, which relaxes you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we cannot claim that CBD does that,
but we can claim for magnesium to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are certain ways to do it if you
want anything right, but still not online.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go online, you need an expert like
Michael.
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do it through interviews in the
magazines, through educational process,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also can say, as an influencer,
myself, I'm also quite experienced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was with my YouTube channel since long
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm quite experienced in marketing of
cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I must admit, it's not easy even for
people who are experienced with social
[SPEAKER_01]: media.
[SPEAKER_01]: The topic cannabis is not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not only recreational cannabis,
also the topic medical cannabis and CBD is
[SPEAKER_01]: not easy for influencers.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people who are also very
experienced are surprised, because all the
[SPEAKER_01]: social media, they change rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like every second month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, my question to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know both markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the US market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we talked before, you use
influencer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use like marketing tools in the social
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us about that, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you're saying, is that even
being an expert in the field, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard because you never know what's going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a page on Facebook where it's kind
of where I do most of my activism called
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mike Wise Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This page got shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, pretty much for an entire year.
[SPEAKER_00]: My reach was restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people will talk about
being shadow banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I actually had messages from Facebook
saying my reach is restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make a post and it would get maybe
10 or 20 likes when normally I make a post
[SPEAKER_00]: and it gets 1,000 shares.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's quite a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of two months ago, they lifted the ban.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put several videos that have gotten
millions of views since that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm happy that the restrictions have
been lifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the USA, you can definitely get away
with a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't as many restrictions on
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Online, they always crack down.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way to know if or when.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just about being careful about
what you put.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what I do is not direct
advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of sharing stories and
testimonials of people who are healing
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll say, oh, I used cannabis and it
helped me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people like this type of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of how I helped to get the
message out there is to just have people
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you firsthand from their experience
their uses with the plant instead of me
[SPEAKER_00]: interjecting, oh, yes, cannabis is good
and it can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making the claims they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here it seems to be successful to do
kind of similar strategies as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, still I can agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still you do not know the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of have to test it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to try something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it works and sometimes it's
banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in my eyes, it's not so heavy or
so it's not too you have the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ideas, they are not so hard to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really hard to realize them
without being banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you always have to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You must not name what you actually want
to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Juri, let me ask you please.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a tobacco and cannabis related product,
I think you also have a lot of problems on
[SPEAKER_01]: social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to focus on the design.
[SPEAKER_01]: How important is the design for your
product, for a product to be marketed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: How important is the design of your
specific product?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about papers for your
marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, of course, the design is very
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the only thing we can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we can take a picture of a
rolling paper booklet and show it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are a business to business company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are not building our brand so much
because we are producing for other brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are like a B2B company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also difficult to promote
ourselves on social media and on
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else because everything is more
B2C, not so much B2B.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the past, because as I told you,
we are in this industry for 20 years
[SPEAKER_03]: already, we were visiting all the trade
shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used some traditional marketing
approaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call clients.
[SPEAKER_03]: We meet with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't do so much social media also,
although we have to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I explained on social media,
we are putting some pictures of booklets
[SPEAKER_03]: and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I remember, your product was the first
with those folded inlays and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your product was the first with the
filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how important was that to make your
product successful?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know the snail papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I first held them in my hand,
I was thinking, oh, somebody thought about
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we had some innovations.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is strange, but rolling papers with
tips are not so old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people still come and don't know what
this is and are amazed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is not so old.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had quite a good success with some
of our models.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you are a company, you always
have to do something new.
[SPEAKER_03]: So either it is a new design or either it
is a new model or it has to be something
[SPEAKER_03]: new.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to develop it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to develop it during your
existence to be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's logical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Petra, your product range is quite big.
[SPEAKER_01]: You told me you are not allowed to publish
on Facebook, to do marketing on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slovenia is quite a small country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you also depend on the export.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there anything but print
advertisement that can be successful for
[SPEAKER_01]: you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how successful can print advertisement
be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, print advertising, I think it went
down with social media and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried to do different ways,
still want to stay legal because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really important for us to stay on the
track that's allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is also our priority.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for example, we did a Nabi CBD shop in
the center of Ljubljana, also for
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing reasons, because if I go and
book a banner somewhere on the,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where, it costs really a lot
of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we have a shop which is stable and
still there and people go by there every
[SPEAKER_02]: day, we have it in a really good central
district.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a small flagship store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a flagship store.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they see the brand, they see,
they go there by that every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is one of the ways to go
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people come in and we had really good
results before Corona with the CBD shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the ways to go to the
customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it's really a hard time to do
it with exporting with Corona and
[SPEAKER_02]: quarantine and staying at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we try to be on this kind of events to
let the world see what we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the ways to do the
marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question goes actually out to all
three panelists and anybody who wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: answer can decide.
[SPEAKER_01]: How important is your own homepage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your own URL.
[SPEAKER_01]: How important is your own homepage for
marketing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Homepage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Web page?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, web page.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is very important because
people go there to find information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we put really strict information.
[SPEAKER_02]: We learned from, we were doing this for
three years, but we've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are really selective what we put on
our website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Web page to get them see what we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard with CBD and everything and
all the restrictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still people can get all the
information there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's really important to do
really nice web page, have information
[SPEAKER_02]: there for them to see and to look up for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd agree on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And complete social media profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: The approach that you have, it may differ
from one to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, I probably think that we are
in different branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: But approach that you choose has to be
different because there's so many things
[SPEAKER_02]: online that you need something to stand
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike, you don't have a physical star.
[SPEAKER_01]: You concentrate on online marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we talked before the panel,
you told me you have a very special
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're connecting CBD and sports.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually an athlete myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently number six in the world for
a sport called wake skating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to wakeboarding,
but you're not strapped into the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can spin the board underneath you
and flip it around when you're riding on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was a big skateboarder for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was explaining this to someone
else at this conference earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, oh, so you're like the Red
Bull of CBD is kind of how I put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cheesy, but I think it is a kind
of a good description of what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have I decided to start sponsoring
athletes because like I mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, no, that was with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CBD wasn't really my passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of THC was my passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like trying to get into the legal part
is when I was able to do more with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can do that legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to sponsor a bunch of
athletes who are professionals all across
[SPEAKER_00]: the spectrum from surfing, skateboarding,
wakeboarding, of course, snowboarding,
[SPEAKER_00]: BMX, motocross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these people rode in the Olympics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's other companies that might
have sponsored four or five people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we really have 35 different athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mainly I focused with sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sponsoring some of the best riders in
Europe because since I'm located here now,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of where my focus is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do business to customer and not business
to business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I did this, it really helped to
expand because it's kind of like I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of mini influencers, if you will,
underneath me promoting for my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I actually focus on Instagram
mainly by launching OG Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus mainly by doing Instagram stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a bunch of athletes on there who
share posts about when they get products
[SPEAKER_00]: or when they're using them, how it helps
them recover from training or sports
[SPEAKER_00]: injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they each spread the message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a lot of people following
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a really successful kind of
strategy that I didn't do it really for
[SPEAKER_00]: the business purposes as much as I want to
really support other riders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's tremendous benefits that
can be found by using cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of a nice thing that
developed that I also helped my business
[SPEAKER_00]: grow by doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me please ask you an additional
question because you're from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: this strategy is already quite common.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say it's already this kind of
strategy is widespread in Europe already
[SPEAKER_01]: or are you kind of is it so far kind of
unique?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unique for Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fortunate to be positioned to at the
time I was to be able to get so many
[SPEAKER_00]: riders because there isn't other companies
doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: there is companies like you said but they
really only do like six or eight athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there's there's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me it's kind of like oh we just got
these guys you know because to show that
[SPEAKER_00]: our company is good they're not really out
to support athletes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's kind of why I've gotten
so many athletes and so many athletes have
[SPEAKER_00]: gravitated towards working with us is
because they realize hey I'm a rider too
[SPEAKER_00]: he wants to hook up people you know our
prices are affordable for for athletes to
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to be authentic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and that's that's what I guess I do
is less marketing and this kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: being who I am and who we are and I'm the
company I don't have employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like OG Labs is this me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jury you're doing kind of a different
approach you also do a lot you do a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: white label products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snail does a lot of white labeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: In how far can this help in a special
branch where you are really you cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: advertise free freely like in your branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot like do free marketing because
it's all limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does white labeling tell me about the
advantages?
[SPEAKER_01]: of white labeling products?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well we do more or less only white
labeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what our brand is the products the
final products of our brand that this is
[SPEAKER_03]: very small portion of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 95% of our business is white labeling
and we will do all kinds of stuff you
[SPEAKER_03]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I explained the promotion of business
to business it's not so easy as business
[SPEAKER_03]: to see because you don't have a such a big
palette of media.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before you mentioned a web page web
page of course has to be very well built
[SPEAKER_03]: because you need to build confidence with
your client because you have a shitty web
[SPEAKER_03]: page you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say this is not a good company.
[SPEAKER_03]: We cannot use we were using because a lot
of magazines emerged in the certain period
[SPEAKER_03]: you had one as well and the print
advertising was very popular and because
[SPEAKER_03]: we are rolling papers and rolling papers
and magazines go kind of a together you
[SPEAKER_03]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were doing rolling papers for magazines
and we got an ad in them but when we
[SPEAKER_03]: checked what the result of the ad was
basically it was very bad you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I read the statistic once this is from
another type of marketing I read the
[SPEAKER_03]: statistic that there is a twice bigger
possibility that you got get hit by a
[SPEAKER_03]: lightning then click a banner ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know what the nice thing is about
marketing today in my eyes in former days
[SPEAKER_01]: it was like Henry Ford said you always
waste 50% of your marketing budget you
[SPEAKER_01]: never know but you never know which 50%
you wasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today you can at least you at least know
if you are a little smart which 50% you
[SPEAKER_01]: wasted because you can track it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now comes my next next question you
mentioned about you mentioned B2B that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: totally different marketing strategy in a
B2B business and you also do B2B.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does your marketing strategy differ
when it comes to B2B from your B2C
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a completely different thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: With B2C you have to be it's really
important how you look on the shelf how
[SPEAKER_02]: how the customer if you sell online what's
the packaging unpacking experience is
[SPEAKER_02]: important.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you sell on I don't know grocery store
it's important where you're placed on the
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do business to business marketing
it's pretty much different because you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to persuade somehow the business
partner that you differ from others and we
[SPEAKER_02]: choose the approach that we offer them
complete every step of the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Complete service.
[SPEAKER_02]: Complete service yeah thank you for
helping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually in cannabis business in Europe
we see really similar products in
[SPEAKER_02]: different packaging that that's one way to
do private labeling and everything but we
[SPEAKER_02]: choose the approach to offer our customers
business B2B customers also the different
[SPEAKER_02]: packaging and options you know it's I
think it's really important that someone
[SPEAKER_02]: stands out in his own way not only to
stand out with his logo and have a green
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf and something on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important that you it's important to
stand out in a way that you get noticed
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can get noticed with great
packaging you can get noticed with great
[SPEAKER_02]: design and we start we try to offer that
to the other companies because we didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: see that on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of also consult your B2B
customers and help them labeling help them
[SPEAKER_01]: develop and but you also if you're not if
you don't agree you also let the customer
[SPEAKER_01]: do his own stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next question question goes out to
Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing so much B2B business I
think you're but you're selling
[SPEAKER_01]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about regulations because I know
you're doing business all over the world
[SPEAKER_01]: and in many different countries and don't
you have any problems with the different
[SPEAKER_01]: national regulations?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty funny you mentioned that
actually I do want to go into B2B this
[SPEAKER_00]: year maybe so we'll look at that but but
the reason that I started doing
[SPEAKER_00]: international and really why why I made OG
labs and everything was because I'm in it
[SPEAKER_00]: for the patients and I'm a cannabis
patient and so I learned about how great
[SPEAKER_00]: of medical benefits come with making some
really high potent THC oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: For myself I had Crohn's disease and so
after I took a certain amount of this oil
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't suffer from the symptoms anymore
and so I told this on my social media and
[SPEAKER_00]: then this is where it kind of spread like
wildfire everyone was messaging me saying
[SPEAKER_00]: hey I need oil for my mom or my daughter
or my sister or my cousin they're dying
[SPEAKER_00]: they have two weeks to live the doctor
gave up on them there's nothing else he
[SPEAKER_00]: can do he said go home and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this was in 2014 and these people are
still alive today so that was kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: fueled international shipping for me and I
try to do it as much as I can with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: my products that aren't high THC oil but
like the high THC oil goes to every
[SPEAKER_00]: country no matter what for the for the
sole reason the only reason is because I
[SPEAKER_00]: get a message and someone says I'm dying
and can you help me and so this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: being the person I am I cannot tell this
person no so even if they're in some
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme place you know in Asia or
something where the laws are extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: harsh I still do everything I can to
package the product discreetly or in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: where it can get to them so that they can
actually use it and recover from some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these serious diseases that the doctors
can't help them with and so I it's it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit harder with the CBD stuff
because of the labeling and the packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: and the design it's it's not easy to make
that discreet so some of these products I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't ship internationally I want to but
they just get stopped by customs and this
[SPEAKER_00]: has happened but you tried it's happened
before and no one's gotten in trouble but
[SPEAKER_01]: customs does stop the package or take it
did they sue you for anything like that so
[SPEAKER_01]: far not yet so my I think we are close to
the end but I want to what I want to know
[SPEAKER_01]: one thing from Yuri still because when you
came into the market Slovenia is not a
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional rolling papers country for
especially not for king size then we had
[SPEAKER_01]: other players in Spain and in France which
were long time before your company on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market but your company I see it in every
girl shop I see it on every and every
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette shop so yeah you made a good job
how did you manage to fight not fight but
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a competitor for those big paper
companies it may sound funny but we
[SPEAKER_03]: attended all the cannabis shows well this
industry changed a lot you know from four
[SPEAKER_03]: big players I will not mention them in the
past there were only four big players
[SPEAKER_03]: producing rolling papers you could get a
lighter printed in every bar or everywhere
[SPEAKER_03]: meanwhile you could not get a print
rolling paper with the label when we
[SPEAKER_03]: started we want to when we didn't have
such big possibilities of production we
[SPEAKER_03]: want to make a private label with one of
the big companies and moq was 300,000 one
[SPEAKER_03]: the big companies when they use the
machine they melt it so nobody else could
[SPEAKER_03]: use it so the machines were not for sale
because they were destroyed after usage
[SPEAKER_03]: and 15 years something like that companies
which were producing machinery emerged and
[SPEAKER_03]: it was possible to buy automatic packing
machine which then caused this industry to
[SPEAKER_03]: spread and I think also there is a
cultural movement maybe that company wants
[SPEAKER_03]: companies and even people want to
personalize things so it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: current state of mind that you want to
personalize you want to have your own and
[SPEAKER_03]: so one thing is that we were company
rolling paper company which was oriented
[SPEAKER_03]: towards a cannabis smoker because
traditional rolling paper companies are
[SPEAKER_03]: not oriented toward kind of the cannabis
smoker they are actually ashamed if
[SPEAKER_03]: someone would be connecting them with
cannabis and the second thing is that the
[SPEAKER_03]: this difference in people's heads and the
possibility that they could make it cost
[SPEAKER_03]: this this growth of of our business you
really did an amazing job for a company
[SPEAKER_01]: that was quite new in the market within
the last 15 years well just to comment
[SPEAKER_03]: your thing about Slovenia not being a
rolling paper country we have we have two
[SPEAKER_03]: producers in Slovenia meanwhile we are
bordering with Italy Hungary Austria
[SPEAKER_03]: Croatia which none of them has producers
of private labor rolling papers I think
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany doesn't have it France doesn't
have it so and we have two so we are a
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling paper country and as you mentioned
in the beginning we never talked about the
[SPEAKER_01]: panel is finished soon but during the
whole panel we never talked about the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing tool cannabis shows and cannabis
congresses and we also should not forget
[SPEAKER_01]: about that even especially here B2B people
this is I think for everybody for anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: who's here cannabis shows and cannabis
congresses are one of the greatest
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities for B2C and for B2B the
business wouldn't you agree that's my last
[SPEAKER_02]: question to our panelists and I think this
is the best way to to stand out to show
[SPEAKER_02]: and to be seen and if people see you they
they can see what you have so if you do
[SPEAKER_02]: your other marketing well then you stand
out and I think that's the main thing
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody wants and the personalization
that Yuri said I think this is the key
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient to go in future marketing and I
think we all experienced how bad it is if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't meet in the last 18 months yeah
we we did 15 expos in 2019 so it's awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: and it like you said it's a great place to
meet people get your brand out give out
[SPEAKER_01]: free products and get the word out and I
still see your brand on every fair well
[SPEAKER_03]: true yeah well we in the beginning we were
like you know the ski World Cup or some
[SPEAKER_03]: similar competition the group of people
were just moving from one place to another
[SPEAKER_03]: it was very small we all knew each other
and now as I said the industry is getting
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger and bigger and also some serious
people are now in it thanks a lot jury I
[SPEAKER_01]: think we come to an end very soon we have
we have come to an end yeah right now
[SPEAKER_01]: we're actually a little running a little
late let's hear it again for me connotes
[SPEAKER_03]: and all the panelists Petra Mike Yuri you
