[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a real heavy hitter today that I
really wanted to speak to you guys He's a
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a Really when I talk about all the
money guys in the industry and who's who's
[SPEAKER_02]: who's raising what and what's happening
and all the venture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Funds there's there's one group that
really stands out among the rest Arcadian
[SPEAKER_02]: and We're fortunate to have the founder of
Arcadian here To you know, who's basically
[SPEAKER_02]: been through it all and now can talk about
what's the analogy for foreign and
[SPEAKER_02]: international markets and what's happened
domestically We're really lucky to have
[SPEAKER_02]: him here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a former quarterback of the
Philadelphia Eagles and He is an extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplished young man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's only 37 years old and I'm really
excited to have him here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please everyone give it up for mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt Nordgren You guys you're happy to be
here make some noise give it up great to
[SPEAKER_00]: be here Alex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you Wonderful event you put on here
bringing so many great people together
[SPEAKER_00]: feel privileged to have the opportunity to
speak to you today I want to also thank
[SPEAKER_00]: ICBC the staff I've had an opportunity to
meet several of you now in different
[SPEAKER_00]: venues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a great job and Berlin Wow,
thank you for hosting this and having us
[SPEAKER_00]: Really fun experiment Yesterday which was
put on some Nikes and just ran around the
[SPEAKER_00]: city had never been here before Really
excited to just get in the culture and ask
[SPEAKER_00]: people questions The first thing that
struck me was just the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: construction here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's insane how much is being
built right one can only attribute that to
[SPEAKER_00]: potential tax revenue from cannabis,
I guess and Then Alex told me this has
[SPEAKER_00]: been going on 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So It's a it's a really interesting
environment One that I think will benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: from our industry a lot just like the rest
of the world and like to see Berlin taking
[SPEAKER_00]: that step My name is Matt Nordgren.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run a fund called Arcadian I exist in a
private equity group running a large
[SPEAKER_00]: family office out of Los Angeles which
years ago we determined we were in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right place at the right time and Sitting
here today feel pretty good about that
[SPEAKER_00]: fact think California is a market That we
can prove businesses at scale The name of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fund why Arcadian it means rustic or
rural which applies but also to proceed
[SPEAKER_00]: without worry which I think all of us in
here have a certain level of confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: that you need and I think As investors you
have to have even additional confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're putting a lot of dollars to
work in this space One really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: question I'd like to pose to the group
here Just so I can get a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea who we have in the room but I think
also for the rest of the room raise your
[SPEAKER_00]: hand if You are involved in running an
opportunity or operating a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Great about half the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you What about how many people in
here are in search of an opportunity or
[SPEAKER_00]: investing into an?
[SPEAKER_00]: Opportunity or a group of people that are
really good at something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raise your hand, please Wow good number of
invent, okay, everyone who raised their
[SPEAKER_00]: hand first turn around and figure out who
those guys are We've officially started
[SPEAKER_00]: dating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to know who's who?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, you know Knowing what kind
of audience you have is really important
[SPEAKER_00]: to and it sounds like we got a pretty
diverse group In fact, Alex told me I
[SPEAKER_00]: think there's 40 countries represented
here I mean, that's pretty phenomenal
[SPEAKER_00]: really excited to have such a such a big
group of people but I think you can boil
[SPEAKER_00]: it down to Investors and guys who have
opportunities good to see there's both
[SPEAKER_00]: here In my walking around in Berlin
yesterday another thing happened I was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for a gift to bring home and Ended
up buying this book that was on Jesus and
[SPEAKER_00]: God and I couldn't read it because it's
not in my language but Ultimately,
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew what that story was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I felt like it was kind of a fun gift
to bring home during doing that the guy
[SPEAKER_00]: asked me what I was In Berlin for because
I had said I was never here and told him
[SPEAKER_00]: why I was buying this gift I said I'm here
for cannabis business and He told me he
[SPEAKER_00]: said You're buying a God book and you're
in the cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't seem right and It was an
interesting point because I got to explain
[SPEAKER_00]: to the guy that even in the Bible There's
about 11 or 12 verses that in some way
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about this plant being Something that
would be acceptable with words like what's
[SPEAKER_00]: put on this Earth's meant for the
consumption of mankind, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not designed by us Interesting
conversation there which led to something
[SPEAKER_00]: else that I want to talk about before I
get into the business of cannabis Why are
[SPEAKER_00]: we all here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here because there's something about
this plant that actually works and
[SPEAKER_00]: resonates with people What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the opportunity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's strip everything away and talk about
why this works it's because that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: which was given to us from the dawn of
Inception you could take everything back
[SPEAKER_00]: to algae fungi bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reverse engineer this stuff and
figure that out I am a god guy personally,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think science is pretty well proven
that we all came from Algae fungi and
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria in the very early stages of all
civilization that we know today This plant
[SPEAKER_00]: happens to produce something that our body
naturally produces and that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about this, it's so
natural it works with our body perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: like A puzzle piece that exists in the
world that is created naturally that can
[SPEAKER_00]: do wonderful things for us So I think you
have to think about this business and
[SPEAKER_00]: really strip away down to the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the plant and The plant is a
technology people think of this is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be commoditized one day and maybe the
whole plant ends up being somewhat of a
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity and prices drop But the plant
technology the science the the the
[SPEAKER_00]: bioscience the chemical properties in the
maker That make up the plant are where the
[SPEAKER_00]: real opportunity is figuring out how each
of those interact with the human body and
[SPEAKER_00]: what you can do To benefit the world off
the back of it Really interesting story
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think you guys would enjoy Our one
of our big investors got married in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Vatican recently and In order to do that
you actually have to disclose everything
[SPEAKER_00]: about your life to get approval to be
married in the Vatican He had to disclose
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that he produced a large amount
of cannabis very interesting point Pope
[SPEAKER_00]: issued from the Pope's office issued a
statement that the Pope has no problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis This is like the most I
can't wait for this to hit the papers and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm one of the owners of high times and
Cannabis Cup and I hope we get to publish
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: This just came back We he was allowed to
get married in there And the official
[SPEAKER_00]: statement was in moderation We have no we
think about cannabis just like we do
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol and tobacco great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to go back to Texas and tell
all my Christian conservative Republicans
[SPEAKER_00]: there that story the point of all this is
Before we can really understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: business I think you have to understand
what this plant is what it can do at the
[SPEAKER_00]: science level what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the plant came from and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been Withheld from us for so many
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not created that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's politics There's other reasons that
haven't allowed it to be available now the
[SPEAKER_00]: world has a voice and it will be what are
you gonna do to capitalize on that
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity while doing a great thing
[SPEAKER_00]: in Talking about some of those
cannabinoids There's about a hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty five or so in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't really know a Lot of
research has to happen for us to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable But I think that's coming and
we haven't had the resources to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: which we now are THC CBD we talk about a
lot in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the ramifications of those two?
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated cannabinoid molecules Don't
forget about CBC CBG CBGA CBNs TACA THCB
[SPEAKER_00]: CBDA Every one of these has a tremendous
effect on the body CBV appetite
[SPEAKER_00]: suppressant It's one of my favorite thing
to talk to new cannabis People that want
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually an appetite suppressant
molecule in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like who would have thought of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that exists So what is the opportunity
I see the cannabis opportunity in three
[SPEAKER_00]: main phases The first phase and every
market sort of that we've studied starts
[SPEAKER_00]: this way And kind of grows at its own pace
depending on politics But eventually they
[SPEAKER_00]: all kind of grow the same way in order for
there to be an industry have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation Have to have some sort of
retail and have to manufacture it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I See that is always this phase number one
as That starts to scale Which we see now
[SPEAKER_00]: in the United States and through Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to see consolidation You
eventually do see prices respond
[SPEAKER_00]: accordingly which would be decrease Phase
two which I think happens just after you
[SPEAKER_00]: create the basic fundamentals of a new
industry is the servicing aspect Once you
[SPEAKER_00]: have the plant in your market once you
have a place you can buy it whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: physician or a retail establishment What
about the data?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we understand our consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about customer retention?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we Continue to use that information
to service our customers What about media
[SPEAKER_00]: events?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about different kinds of software
that exists in every other industry with
[SPEAKER_00]: the stigma around this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those big companies don't feel comfortable
addressing the cannabis industry until a
[SPEAKER_00]: point in time So I think you have a second
wave of opportunity in the servicing and
[SPEAKER_00]: ancillary category The third ends up being
off the back of that once everything gets
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out the industry the machines
built now You have brands all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities off the back end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of think about it like gold mining,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a typical example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear a lot in this industry Go back to
the gold miners, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be gold for there to be a
business Right without cannabis we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: or cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a business but ultimately
those gold miners need picks and shovels
[SPEAKER_00]: and boots and jeans and In order to
function Levi jeans, for example started
[SPEAKER_00]: that way and is still around then
ultimately you have to have a Consumer for
[SPEAKER_00]: the gold you got to have a ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have a watch Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think cannabis industry can be seen
in similar phases You have to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: gold you have to have ways to run the
business and then you got to ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: have a variety of consumers to utilize the
product Within those categories,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have three additional Markets
to address which is Medical we talk a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about that in here today because this is a
medical market You have the
[SPEAKER_00]: over-the-counter market nutraceuticals and
then you have recreational We've seen this
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve in every market as well similarly
to the different phases of the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow in the market you end up having
Regulations set in that typically put
[SPEAKER_00]: products in those three categories if you
can meet a certain level of regulation no
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide Problems things like that and
you don't have any further study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well now You probably have a recreational
product that you can infuse in anything in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grocery store based on a very low
hurdle of regulation the next hurdle might
[SPEAKER_00]: be Such that you have an over-the-counter
product product that you can charge a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more for Has gone through a
certain level of study, but ultimately not
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to be qualified as true medical
product true medical product will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: third category where you have to go
through A rigorous amount of clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trial research and study in order to be
approved at that level of regulation So I
[SPEAKER_00]: think you ultimately also see a variety of
levels of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that ultimately mean I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Think that means that every person on
planet Earth is a cannabinoid consumer one
[SPEAKER_00]: day No disrespect to Henry Rollins who
said he's never touched it before earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: No disrespect to the gentleman who was
just here hasn't smoked in 20 years but I
[SPEAKER_00]: do think that Everybody when they
understand the science of this and they
[SPEAKER_00]: understand where the industry is going I
do think you will see Cannabinoid in every
[SPEAKER_00]: product in every grocery store in America
think about b12.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's b12?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you all love it Omega fish oil all
these wonderful things that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: proven to do some pretty interesting
effects for the human body Will happen in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to those cannabinoids I mentioned
earlier you might see c23 who knows what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna brand it as but it'll pass a
certain level of regulation if it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: medical it'll be a Certification you could
put on a product because you can isolate
[SPEAKER_00]: it and extract it now You can infuse it in
literally anything in the grocery store,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you could put that brand on it So I
do think that everybody has the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is the new salt somebody said in my last
One of my last speeches and I thought that
[SPEAKER_00]: was actually pretty interesting to think
about it this way right I mean Fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: there's actually ten times more amount of
fungi on planet Earth than there are
[SPEAKER_00]: plants People don't realize the symbiotic
relationship that the fungi has in the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots with the delivery of oxygen and
nutrients and all those other things
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid is a very basic Human element
that we produce ourselves that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally get from the environment So I
think you have to look at how big this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry can be and I do think it will be
everywhere in the world at some level How
[SPEAKER_00]: I go about Investing in this space That's
the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to ask ourselves in phase one
things that require a license things that
[SPEAKER_00]: touch the plant We felt that the
opportunity for that is in some markets
[SPEAKER_00]: and most markets federally illegal Not
something we could do in the family office
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to look at phase two,
which was those businesses that get built
[SPEAKER_00]: around it what we decided to do from that
standpoint was focus on companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been around for a number of years and
have revenue growth and can certify that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are In compliance with federal law So
we became a good place for the industry's
[SPEAKER_00]: most successful ancillary companies to
come to in order to receive capital but
[SPEAKER_00]: also a big private equity firms experience
on What it means to provide growth equity
[SPEAKER_00]: and then how do you prepare yourself for
the next phase?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of our companies are starting to
mature high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have an offer on Nasdaq very soon
Similar thesis with the rest of our
[SPEAKER_00]: companies you get a company that's at
scale get liquidity get public currency
[SPEAKER_00]: have some form of consolidation and then
you go out and try to provide capital and
[SPEAKER_00]: other resources to Other and other
businesses in that same vertical in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to scale high times has no It doesn't
think it's the end-all be-all from
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody it services a very specific type
of cannabis customer But the good news is
[SPEAKER_00]: if you subscribe to the theory that
cannabinoids is the future then that means
[SPEAKER_00]: every single person Fits in the
cannabinoid category and everybody has a
[SPEAKER_00]: different profile So everyone has to be
catered to differently now high times can
[SPEAKER_00]: provide capital to those companies and
ultimately let them all grow and service
[SPEAKER_00]: various demographic and geographic regions
So I think you're gonna see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: consolidation in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing it right now on the plant
touching side Think valuations are as high
[SPEAKER_00]: as they'll be over this next year or two
and then I think you see two three four
[SPEAKER_00]: years after that Consolidation of all the
ancillary companies and then two three
[SPEAKER_00]: years after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you start to see consolidation of
brands One interesting thing I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: always try to point out based on all the
things we've been talking about the wide
[SPEAKER_00]: use of this plant is that Everybody's
skill set is transferable to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much business opportunity and
those of us that have gotten in it early I
[SPEAKER_00]: think have the most likelihood of success
But ultimately we want to encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody to be in this industry whether
you're a graphic designer a tomato farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: a Finance person this industry requires
all of us in order to make it work The one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I can say based on that is that I
think the companies and the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen not do well are the ones that
aren't very niche for Focused it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to get distracted in this industry
because there's a lot of great things to
[SPEAKER_00]: do But I do think you know what we're
looking for and we're investing in a
[SPEAKER_00]: company is somebody who's solving a very
specific problem at a very high level
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no regulated business in the
entire world that you can do everything
[SPEAKER_00]: They regulate it for a reason and it will
be separated into various points Along the
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this industry will be the exact
same mostly because they like to tax it
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also like to just regulate it and
keep control of things So I think you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to solve specific pain points.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be really really really good
at something I don't think you can do at
[SPEAKER_00]: all in our companies and our CEOs have
been proven to do that Very well
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of those companies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can I kind of break the industry
down into a few segments you have
[SPEAKER_00]: production You have cultivation you have
manufacturing Phase one the ones that we
[SPEAKER_00]: like to look at in the second phase are
business software business services Social
[SPEAKER_00]: media online media print media vaporizers
and accessories production equipment and
[SPEAKER_00]: supplies HR data There's an immense amount
of industry that needs to come into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in order for it to grow properly
Those are the type of companies we're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for What's interesting enough that
happens is these companies that are a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years down the road For example,
let's use a company called BDS analytics
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're involved with they're a
point-of-sale data company Point-of-sale
[SPEAKER_00]: data exists everywhere else But it doesn't
exist in the space because the big players
[SPEAKER_00]: Nielsen in the United States for example
Doesn't feel comfortable servicing the
[SPEAKER_00]: space so I can go into a company and look
at a company that's got Two three years of
[SPEAKER_00]: proven revenue that I think is probably
worth a 10 12 15 multiple based on What
[SPEAKER_00]: happens if you're not servicing cannabis
and Nielsen was going to buy you for
[SPEAKER_00]: example But because they service cannabis
for a proven business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get a five multiple six multiple
seven multiple We basically get a 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: discount on a proven business that has no
legal constraints and if we guess right
[SPEAKER_00]: and that company ends up being the market
winner when Nielsen and those companies
[SPEAKER_00]: are ready to Buy I guarantee you they're
big enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care the price They know they
have to have market share and they'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to buy the market So then you have
to ask yourself what companies aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive on an exit and what are and
that's ultimately a funds Fund manager and
[SPEAKER_00]: a fund investment committee's decision to
try to sort through for example banking
[SPEAKER_00]: banking is a major pain point insurance
major pain point The likelihood that those
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get solved is very low also the
likelihood that they want To buy an
[SPEAKER_00]: insurance or a bank business that's been
around a couple years and cannabis is also
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty low Because they'll be able to
offer those exact same products So from an
[SPEAKER_00]: investment standpoint we decided not to
pursue those because of that factor
[SPEAKER_00]: Although they are pain points lots of pain
points just have to figure out the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that ultimately have value at the end of
the day When I want to leave some time for
[SPEAKER_00]: some questions But why am I up here
talking to you about all this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the answer probably is because if
You're gonna have chips in this space
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in here probably has a unique
skill set or a reason why they're in it
[SPEAKER_00]: Having exposure to a fund which I run one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple great funds There's
another investment group here Nick who's
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking tomorrow his group's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's about ten other funds in
the United States I think are at our level
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them Can give you exposure to the
space in a hedged way Can get you access
[SPEAKER_00]: to lots of great resources and brainpower
ultimately only making whatever it is you
[SPEAKER_00]: decide to do a Better strategy by having a
big shop with the machine built around you
[SPEAKER_00]: to help grow that business, so I hope you
do Decide to talk to somebody who runs a
[SPEAKER_00]: big investment shops, but focus on this
space because I do think it helps
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody with whatever they're trying to
do individually Really excited to be here
[SPEAKER_00]: again I want to make one last point which
is I'm a whole plant guy, and I love the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant people And I'll never change
right that that's that's sort of how I
[SPEAKER_00]: came into the industry is being that type
of consumer But look at the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's estimated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about 25 million consumers of
cannabis United States market 325 million
[SPEAKER_00]: people there so if we have an objective to
get this plant in the hands of every
[SPEAKER_00]: Single person we're gonna have to
understand what that means if this room
[SPEAKER_00]: had a hundred people based on the American
numbers today Which is a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: market to scale 13% are current users Or
potential users of the flower so we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to service that community That's a lot of
people 25 million is a big number,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's 300 million other people that
will be new consumers How will they be
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced to the cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Prop if you walk the room 100 people 90 87
other people would be very tough to say
[SPEAKER_00]: hey you should come to cannabis and just
enroll this plant and smoke it now guy
[SPEAKER_00]: like me probably Would try to argue that
but ultimately it's about making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody has a product that they're
comfortable with so those other 87% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people What are we gonna create for them
is it inedible is it topical is it a
[SPEAKER_00]: sublingual?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but the important thing is
that everybody has access to this
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid whole plant and Business guys
that are trying to find other ways to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we can all have the same mission
Which is move this industry forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at
[SPEAKER_04]: So last time for two more additional
questions, I think And the next panel is
[SPEAKER_04]: already starting so are there any
questions?
Okay
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi Hendrick create from Where where we
currently in Europe if you compare the u
[SPEAKER_01]: .s.
[SPEAKER_01]: To Europe in terms of private equity or
venture capital great question and the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for investment funds is Really
there because of the institutional
[SPEAKER_00]: investors aren't really in the space yet
So I think even in America you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: that For Europe, but you're in phase one,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to still figure out how
you're gonna grow it where you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it how it's gonna be Manufactured so
you're kind of in that first phase so
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the market The opportunity is
just where the market dictates Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: We help write Mexico's policy We know
there's a handful of families that are
[SPEAKER_00]: about to be announced that have that
They're at square one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna import from Canada for six
to nine months The likelihood that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need services is not very high right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a few years down the road So I think
in Europe, you know your steps beyond that
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're getting to the point now where
you want to understand data, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard people talk today about Germany
There's a business here and there's 20,000
[SPEAKER_00]: but no one knows the data behind them so I
think the opportunity in Europe is you can
[SPEAKER_00]: still get your hands on great licensed
businesses at a decent a Decent price and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can be on that side of this But I do
think the real opportunity is in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: wave of businesses You know, I you can't
even find hardly a vape pen in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't in California, which is the
other benefit actually about being in,
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can you can test Businesses across
every vertical in this industry at scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 35 million people you have 200
something million that come through there
[SPEAKER_00]: every year We've got a great market to
test any philosophy at massive scale to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if it's gonna work so we like to use
California as a bit of a testing ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think we've done and Then I think
the next step for us We are launching a
[SPEAKER_00]: European fund right now in order to take
everything we built here into the European
[SPEAKER_00]: market off the back of the growth of The
basic part of the industry So there would
[SPEAKER_04]: be time for one more Question sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay last question, please
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Francesco Empress pharmaceuticals,
Switzerland Yeah, I got a question,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's not for pharma stuff because
actually we're talking Since the beginning
[SPEAKER_03]: about just the business of the buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean the extracts Everything but we're
not speaking about the opportunities on
[SPEAKER_03]: the business on the old plants You know
because actually the point is you might
[SPEAKER_03]: know it Financially speaking actually as
well for design as well for materials
[SPEAKER_03]: bioplastics and fuels and I mean There's a
lot of opportunities not just on buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean the amp is like pork You can take
out everything you want even the roots we
[SPEAKER_03]: can say over here in Europe with The Sun
most in the south we can say that actually
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants reach four meters height,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Even even five even seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the roots are really big so you can
even take wood out of it really right wood
[SPEAKER_03]: so you can make everything out of it,
so I mean the financial potency of the
[SPEAKER_03]: business Should not be just concentrated
into buds, but everywhere else because
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of job to do there's a lot
of work to do as well a lot of my friends
[SPEAKER_03]: are working in Europe and as well
worldwide to develop a lot of Materials
[SPEAKER_03]: new material new resins new stuff to do be
bio things I mean, so that will be really
[SPEAKER_03]: huge stuff to do if everybody over here,
you know, just I think that's that's part
[SPEAKER_00]: without going into all the business
opportunities, that's exactly what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to Express up here, which is the
massive amount of opportunities and just
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're talking about In fact,
I have a friend in the industry who
[SPEAKER_00]: actually put together a business plan and
I don't know if they got in front of him
[SPEAKER_00]: or not But he's trying to put it in front
of the White House to say hey if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna build a wall Why don't you do it on
a hemp creed at least right like do so and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a bit of a joke but again,
right if If we could ever get there who
[SPEAKER_00]: knows but hey laughter is the best form of
medicine cannabis certainly Could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine in that regard But I agree with
you and I think that we should all walk
[SPEAKER_00]: away with that thought that there are so
much business opportunity It's not just
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the people who are advocating it
today understand whole plant benefit to
[SPEAKER_00]: them But as this industry moves forward,
I challenge you all to think about what
[SPEAKER_00]: does the consumer look like today?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it look like tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it look like five and ten years
from now because it's a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different answer and understanding what
hemp can do with its Byproducts
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding, you know the the
cannabinoid profiles and what each of them
[SPEAKER_00]: can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the industry is going So if
anybody in here is running a business
[SPEAKER_00]: that's at scale that meets our criteria,
I'd love to know you We're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: great opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been able to raise a significant
amount of capital A lot of people want
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure to this space We've got great
smart people that are happy to help dig
[SPEAKER_00]: through all those opportunities if you're
looking for exposure to space we are
[SPEAKER_00]: Committed capital fund and always keeping
that open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So love to talk to you about that,
too My email is Matt at Arcadian fund
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all your time and just love
everybody's passion and enthusiasm in here
[SPEAKER_00]: for this industry Give it up for Matthew
with the Arcadian fund Magnificent Thank you.
