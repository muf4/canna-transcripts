[SPEAKER_06]: In this today's panel discussion on the
burgeoning cannabis industries in Europe
[SPEAKER_06]: versus North America where the landscapes
are rapidly evolving and in a cybernetic
[SPEAKER_06]: relations as nearly half of US states
embrace adult use legalization and
[SPEAKER_06]: medicinal cannabis continues to flourish
our Attention now turns to Europe Germany
[SPEAKER_06]: in particular where the industry is still
in its infancy But rhyming with potential
[SPEAKER_06]: so if you ever wondered what it takes for
the US Cannabis companies to conquer the
[SPEAKER_06]: European market stick around For as we
discuss the essential market entry work
[SPEAKER_06]: Requisites for navigating Europe's green
frontiers.

[SPEAKER_06]: not least we have Kai Friedrich Nieman a

[SPEAKER_06]: highly knowledgeable legal expert in the
cannabis industry offering comprehensive
[SPEAKER_06]: support for contract drafting to
regulatory compliance He operates

evolving legal landscape while he also has
[SPEAKER_06]: his blog cannabis.legal and he's also a
effective lobbyist and working with many
[SPEAKER_06]: associations in Germany and beyond So Kai,
let's start with you straight away
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis is legalized in Germany and the
industry is impatiently waiting for the
[SPEAKER_06]: final passing of the law What is the
status of legalization in Germany and what
[SPEAKER_06]: stage are we at and what are the some of
the Biggest roadblocks on a global and
[SPEAKER_05]: local level Yeah, yeah, we are not done
yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't think that so It's almost like a
classical drama in five acts and I will
[SPEAKER_05]: give you an overview of that So the
journey began the drama began in November
[SPEAKER_05]: 21 We had federal elections and a new
government was in place and you the
[SPEAKER_05]: traffic light coalition and they announced
in November 21 that cannabis will be
[SPEAKER_05]: legalized and the distribution by
distribution of cannabis in specialized
[SPEAKER_05]: stores and dispensaries that was the aim
in November 21 then the increasing moment
[SPEAKER_05]: came in October In October 22 and there
was a paper published by the Federal
[SPEAKER_05]: Ministry of Health Saying okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our plan to enroll a commercial
route for cannabis distribution in Germany
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone said oh, yeah Germany's really
legalizing commercial route great And then
[SPEAKER_05]: the third the third act was in April 23
The Federal Minister of Health and the
[SPEAKER_05]: Federal Minister of Agriculture saying
okay, the commercial route doesn't work We
[SPEAKER_05]: have legal problems a single convention EU
framework Etc.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to Do it the other way and then
they presented Again a paper saying okay
[SPEAKER_05]: You are only allowed to possess 25 grams
of cannabis We are planning to introduce
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis cultivation associations.
[SPEAKER_05]: No cannabis social clubs So no
consummation on the premises but cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation association for collective
homegrown and the homegrown of option for
[SPEAKER_05]: three plants at home, so that was Of
course a big step back and it was probably
[SPEAKER_05]: and completely overregulated So that was a
big disappointment at that point of time
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we saw the first draft in In
October in August last year in 23 and it
[SPEAKER_05]: was so heavily restricted so
prohibitionist a drama nothing left over
[SPEAKER_05]: from from the initial plans and then the
Fourth act started by even these reduced
[SPEAKER_05]: plans were attacked from all sides from
police Associations from physician
[SPEAKER_05]: associations Etc and it was not clear if
these draft will enter Bundestag at all
[SPEAKER_05]: and then the Ukraine war came and the tax
problems Came and it was scheduled for
[SPEAKER_05]: November It was postponed and then It was
scheduled for December postponed for
[SPEAKER_05]: January postponed and Jen in February
three weeks ago the law passed Bundestag
[SPEAKER_05]: and Now we are in the situation that the
Bundesrat the Federal Council has to
[SPEAKER_05]: approve that law as well He can't really
prevent it, but he can appeal to a
[SPEAKER_05]: mediation committee And if that is done if
they appeal next Friday for the mediation
[SPEAKER_05]: committee The law can't enter into force
at first of April and Bennett will enter
[SPEAKER_05]: into Force is completely open and this
would be the last act of this classical
[SPEAKER_05]: drama the catastrophe no change at all So
you think first of April is off the table?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 50-50.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 50-50.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many people are working on that right now
the the resistance came from the federal
[SPEAKER_05]: states because they saying oh my god,
we have to implement new Administrative
[SPEAKER_05]: procedures and we have to look through old
criminal files.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we have to release some prisoners
No, we are completely overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please stop that law And this is the
problem right now But are the people
[SPEAKER_06]: overthinking or is it realistic concern
that they have at this moment for the
[SPEAKER_06]: changes that are outstanding?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean the the Green Party was always in
favor of legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: They Bought the first bill in 2015 to
Bundestag the Cannabis Control Act and now
[SPEAKER_05]: it seems that the ministry the green
ministers From the federal states our
[SPEAKER_05]: power thing just this law It would be
political suicide for the Green Party if
[SPEAKER_05]: it's in the end the fault of the Green
Party if the law doesn't come into enter
[SPEAKER_06]: into force, so I agree so Jamie with that
in the back of your With the back of our
[SPEAKER_06]: minds What advice would you give American
brands who hire your group the New Holland
[SPEAKER_06]: group for entering into you Europe?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are some vital aspects that they have
to consider?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I worked at bang for those of you
that know bang chocolate I ran that
[SPEAKER_01]: company for seven years and one of the
things I did was When I started the
[SPEAKER_01]: company we were in California when I left
we were in seven states Canada And I
[SPEAKER_01]: brought the CBD division into Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my experience sort of boots on the
ground is navigating the complexities of
[SPEAKER_01]: the legal market whatever Happening
legally things change on a dime.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be able to pivot quickly and
know how to do things For example,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want to buy a hundred thousand
packages to get a cheaper rate Knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: that the government could on a dime change
something and then that whole batch of
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging becomes obsolete So I put the
legal framework more in the boots on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground operational strategy and what I
would say to that What Kai just explained
[SPEAKER_01]: is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a political seas, you know
football going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a seesaw We don't know what's gonna
happen Friday is D day what I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: telling my clients is Germany is Pharma in
in the words of Cita Schubert those of you
[SPEAKER_01]: who know her full stop Pharma,
so if you want to come in and be a brand
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really early.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no brands ready Right now and even
in the social model if it passes brands
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't really a thing However,
if you're an American brand and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: credibility and people know you because
like everywhere Cannabis American cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is in high demand, especially cannabis
from California So if you have a brand
[SPEAKER_01]: with tremendous credibility as we've
witnessed with cookies that came over here
[SPEAKER_01]: and has been able to open stores and And I
don't want to open that but There is a
[SPEAKER_01]: path and there's a path for doing B to C
so Approaching your consumer directly
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than going the traditional B to B
route And then going the farmer route.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to make sure that you are
building your brand through the
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional medical Channels now one thing
I want to say and then you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let someone else speak here,
but I think when you're Talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: brands in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You you really just have to think about
The European market compared to the North
[SPEAKER_01]: American market, which is kind of was the
title of our panel in America Medical you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to put air quotes around it because
it was really just a workaround so we
[SPEAKER_01]: could put the plant in people's hands in
Europe medical actually means medical it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a doctor prescription It's healthy
sometimes health insurance if you can jump
[SPEAKER_01]: through those hoops you get the medicine
at a pharmacy You're not going to a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of you in Europe know that but for
my American compadres Especially the new
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that are here Medical cannabis in
Europe looks nothing like medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in America So I think that what we're
seeing is that those medical laws will
[SPEAKER_01]: probably loosen and it'll be easier for
people and patients to get their hands on
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis, but it's probably not going to
be anytime soon Like what we see in the
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational states in the US Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do as an American company operating
in the North American cannabis market for
[SPEAKER_06]: more than eight years or How do how long
ago did you begin to prepare to enter for
[SPEAKER_06]: the European market?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what steps did you take and what were
the most difficult challenges also coming
[SPEAKER_06]: here with an American perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: to Europe Thank You Lisa I Come back to
Europe with a view from my previous
[SPEAKER_02]: chapter when I lived in Europe and I was
country manager of Astra now Astra Zeneca
[SPEAKER_02]: and When I left Astra I didn't think I was
going to go be going back into the pharma
[SPEAKER_02]: business and so I returned back the United
States acquired this company seal and We
[SPEAKER_02]: were in the recreational market for all
intents and purposes as Jamie mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: medical cannabis In the United States was
really just a pathway to get to
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational Here in Europe Here in Europe
It is as Jamie said very much of a
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical market and so I look back
to those days at Astra when we had reps
[SPEAKER_02]: detailing doctors educating doctors
solving distribution problems for
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacies, so We had to you know Go back
to the old playbook and so we re-entered
[SPEAKER_02]: or we entered the European market a few
years ago You know, it's a GMP market and
[SPEAKER_02]: our equipment is is qualified for GMP
certification I was in a customer's
[SPEAKER_02]: facility yesterday in Portugal and I can
tell you there's not a single North
[SPEAKER_02]: American facility that looks like this
facility I saw yesterday in Portugal and
[SPEAKER_02]: then it is it is clean GMP the processes
is professional and So I think the jury I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean the pathway as Jamie said is very
clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pharma.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to stay pharma Recreation is
not on the horizon here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably little room for brands in
the traditional sense in the European
[SPEAKER_02]: market for years to come But we're very
excited and I look forward to being back
[SPEAKER_02]: in the pharma business in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say Ozempic is a brand and It's a
pharma brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a ability to brand pharma But
we're so early.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's not time for that yet But do you
see also many differences on how business
[SPEAKER_06]: is done here like so in comparison to the
states The United States You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a go-go market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean you have legacy growers you have
institutional investors Here it's much
[SPEAKER_02]: more of a steadied Slow organic growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's going to be seismic
changes Like you might see in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States and Chloe hit it this morning the
earlier panel that we're all now waiting
[SPEAKER_02]: for the DEA to endorse or not endorse The
rescheduling of of cannabis from the
[SPEAKER_02]: narcotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say that the Germans may have beat us
to the punch But the jury's out till next
[SPEAKER_02]: Friday But it's going to be very studied
Growth I don't see any hyperbolic growth
[SPEAKER_02]: that you saw in the United States,
which is arguably a 30 billion dollar
[SPEAKER_02]: market now I don't have a hard number for
Europe, but it is a fraction of that but
[SPEAKER_06]: we have Bitcoin so we're all okay So Jamie
back to you like more also from a
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial strategy point of view What has
changed about your view of the European
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis industry since the German and
Dutch ward or maybe even since you started
[SPEAKER_01]: entering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so I I entered the European market in
2016 It's hard to believe in dog years,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that make me a hundred?
[SPEAKER_01]: and That market we were so hopeful and
Every year it's kind of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we always say and then cannabis
happened You just get kicked in the teeth,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know You think you're gonna make big
progress and you really don't and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be Debbie downer but but what's
changed for me as I realize I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: think The European cannabis market is
doing it right in comparison with the
[SPEAKER_01]: American market because we have so many
problems with the illicit market I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that it should be a situation
where you've got people in prison for this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant And then what you do is you legalize
it, but then you create a new set of
[SPEAKER_01]: criminals quote-unquote Which are the
people that open or have illicit
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2018, for example in California We
had 3,000 dispensaries it goes wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only 300 legal dispensaries the
next day all 3,000 stayed open now you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got 2,700 new criminals instead of
lowering the bar and letting the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that were operating You know enter the
legal market and I I am hoping that in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe which has a robust Illicit market
everybody uses cannabis That there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway to not create new criminals and I
think that part of the delays Thank you,
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think part of the delays are about the
lawmakers are not jockeying Us versus
[SPEAKER_01]: them, which is the problem we have in the
u.s.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Democrats versus Republicans Well,
if they if they do the bill that we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to approve it And all that kind of
stuff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very thoughtful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a parliamentary process You've
got coalitions that are all putting their
[SPEAKER_01]: stakeholders and their policies in place
and bringing the concerns that they have
[SPEAKER_01]: to the table and I think one of the big
concerns is criminal justice and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: part of that is What is causing some of
this delay and I'm I'm grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm grateful that there is EU GMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the the medicine is Coming out of clean
facilities because I can tell you I have
[SPEAKER_01]: toured probably near a thousand grows in
my life and And some of the best ones are
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Europe for sure So I think the
Europeans might not be getting it right
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way, but I think they're getting a
lot of it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe just out of the regular question
here Kai Can you give a little comment on
[SPEAKER_06]: social justice in Germany and how this is
developing and this discussion is
[SPEAKER_06]: developing and with amnesty?
[SPEAKER_05]: Social social justice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that is exactly the point where
these ministry ministers from the federal
[SPEAKER_05]: states are complaining because They would
have to go through 100,000 cases to see if
[SPEAKER_05]: they have to be eradicated these
convictions And we have two little staff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's skip that Let's skip that and then
we will consent to the to the to the bill.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so much to social justice awareness
of politicians in Germany Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Otto Like in Germany, we have talked
about that market We have roughly some
[SPEAKER_06]: time between something between 20 to 30
tons of medicinal cannabis flower imports
[SPEAKER_06]: in 2023 so far reported in some individual
states in the US you have hundreds of tons
[SPEAKER_06]: alone so is Europe even on the mark on the
radar of American companies so I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: give an example of Just one state and this
is really the opportunity that Europe has
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna use scale so if Germany last
last year was 30 tons approximately of
[SPEAKER_02]: flower most of it imported One state
Michigan Consumed 160 tons of flower one
[SPEAKER_02]: state so you amplify that and if you want
to use that as a benchmark to what the
[SPEAKER_02]: European market Could look like in your
greater population.
[SPEAKER_02]: The opportunity is enormous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it just stays medical the
opportunity is enormous so we're all here
[SPEAKER_02]: in the early days and All that groundwork
is being done on the regulatory front
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany leading the way, but I think it's
gonna be very interesting with the
[SPEAKER_02]: European Parliament elections coming up
What the European Parliament does and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna ask our German colleagues a return
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you say the European Parliament?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how this playing out in the
European Parliament not just in Germany
[SPEAKER_06]: On a European level that's a good question
But it's like I don't know we all don't
[SPEAKER_06]: have a grass bubble that we can look into
that's a little bit the problem But
[SPEAKER_06]: hopefully and I hope many of you are also
working on that within the countries that
[SPEAKER_06]: we come together and that we really lobby
as a European industry Because that is
[SPEAKER_06]: something that we have been missing in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had our first industry association in
2019 and the thing that we all need to do
[SPEAKER_06]: more and also more jointly Is to really
lobby on a European level, especially with
[SPEAKER_06]: the European elections coming up soon We
just continue with the questions here
[SPEAKER_06]: because we're like, yeah, yeah,
we have an echo up here like sometimes we
[SPEAKER_06]: like, yeah So Kai we have a rescheduling
injured a re-evaluation of the laws in
[SPEAKER_06]: Germany Those this does not only have
impact on the recreational part,
[SPEAKER_06]: but also on the medical part and on the
hemp sector What do you expect for the
[SPEAKER_06]: future of these areas?
[SPEAKER_06]: And also in regard to global developments
and the upcoming European election.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure so once again if the law if
they appeal to the Mediation committee
[SPEAKER_05]: next week the law won't pass at the 1st of
April when it will pass then is completely
[SPEAKER_05]: unclear It may be fails at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it Enters into force at the 1st of
April cannabis will be rescheduled and not
[SPEAKER_05]: part of the Narcotic Act anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be a regular commodity Highly
regulated though, but a regular commodity.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one advantage, of course And as a
regular commodity as a regular medicine
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't need a Narcotic prescription
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to obey these safety
regulations anymore the lesser
[SPEAKER_05]: Documentation obligations, etc.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was it would be a big a big
advantage and it would access easy the
[SPEAKER_05]: access for medical patients as well in
Germany because then the stigma is gone
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can Prescribe cannabis for back
pain basically that it's no problem then
[SPEAKER_05]: anymore and every the medical import
companies Of course, they hope for this if
[SPEAKER_05]: they hope for this boost And the patient's
numbers will be wise by by that I just
[SPEAKER_02]: want to add the the German law will
benefit the patients more prescribing
[SPEAKER_02]: doctors in Germany The change the
rescheduling if the rescheduling occurs in
[SPEAKER_02]: the United States It will have very little
impact on patients It'll have a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: impact on the growers because of the tax
implications 280 it's an arcane IRS rule,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we'll be able to depreciate but That
rescheduling plays out differently in the
[SPEAKER_05]: two markets Thank you for that addition so
Can I add something and the the most
[SPEAKER_05]: surprising development showed up in
November as they Published the amendments
[SPEAKER_05]: to the law which is now coming into force
is that all restrictions on medical
[SPEAKER_05]: medical cannabis cultivation will be
lifted So everyone who wants to produce
[SPEAKER_05]: who wants to cultivate cannabis medical
cannabis according to pharmaceutical grade
[SPEAKER_05]: will Be can can do so and we have three
domestic licenses already in place by
[SPEAKER_05]: Demica and Aurora and Tilray and they are
only allowed to produce 10 tons in Four
[SPEAKER_05]: years lifted.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are only allowed to produce three
strains lifted and every company There's
[SPEAKER_05]: no restrictions on the number of companies
So if you want to grow medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany, you can do that with a with a new
law And then you have to think of the
[SPEAKER_05]: single convention of article 21,
which is basically Saying the more you
[SPEAKER_05]: produce domestically the less you can
import So this has the potential to change
[SPEAKER_05]: the whole scene and in the long term in
the short in the mid to long run You
[SPEAKER_05]: probably will have to produce Cannabis
medical cannabis in Germany if you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: distribute it in Germany So you take a
close look on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh that will unfold very important Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the final question to all of you
panelists may be starting with you Jamie
[SPEAKER_06]: What will be the biggest surprise?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Europe in the next 12 months Well,
it won't be a surprise to me but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: what will be surprising to the government
is that the efforts to decriminalize the
[SPEAKER_01]: lifting of the limits is going to create
an environment where cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: ubiquitous and it's going to be very
difficult for the police to start
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcing and I think what you're going to
have is a free-for-all and They're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: underestimate the entrepreneurial spirit
around cannabis And so you're gonna have I
[SPEAKER_01]: think an illicit market explode that
they're gonna have a very difficult time
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling Because if you're a police
officer In Spain, for example because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no borders you go over to Germany
you buy something that's adult use you
[SPEAKER_01]: bring it over It's decriminalized here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be mayhem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna Be chaos.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I predict I agree I'm gonna go
with the short term and see what happens a
[SPEAKER_02]: week from tomorrow in Germany Not 12
months because I think what happens in
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany is a bellwether for the EU
Parliament and the tone it's gonna have
[SPEAKER_02]: implications for Spain As Carla mentioned
in the earlier panel and it's gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: provide if it passes political cover for
politicians Or in the United States at the
[SPEAKER_02]: DA passes it It'll give political cover
then for our politicians our dysfunctional
[SPEAKER_02]: political government in the United States
to possibly change the tone in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not gonna do that They're not
gonna do that they're not gonna change
[SPEAKER_06]: their time but that's something very
critical that I think is we are heading in
[SPEAKER_06]: that direction where we have a cup all
different countries all finding different
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations it's no harmonized market many
bottlenecks and That's something we as an
[SPEAKER_06]: industry also need to try to avoid and
create more harmonized regulations across
[SPEAKER_06]: Europe and not only for individual
countries Hi, what's your biggest
[SPEAKER_06]: surprise?
[SPEAKER_05]: Next Friday No, there will be a lot of
surprises coming up over the year I guess
[SPEAKER_05]: as it has been the last two years as we
try to legalize or decriminalize or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever with cannabis in Germany but as
it seems there is a Developing a sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: European standard for for legalization If
you look at Malta if you look at
[SPEAKER_05]: Luxembourg if you look at Germany and the
Czech Republic announced something similar
[SPEAKER_05]: So this cannabis cultivation model with
500 members maximum and these three plant
[SPEAKER_05]: at home this seems to develop to a
European standard which Member state can
[SPEAKER_05]: easily adopt and apply without getting
into conflict with the EU Commission And
[SPEAKER_05]: we will see that with Czech Republic as
well probably And then we will have the EU
[SPEAKER_05]: elections for the EU Parliament in
summertime in June and they are already
[SPEAKER_05]: working groups of MPs in the European
Parliament working on cannabis reform On a
[SPEAKER_05]: European level the EU framework a decision
from 2004 we know that the Schengen a Cree
[SPEAKER_05]: all Having regulations on cannabis in
place which makes the legalization so
[SPEAKER_05]: difficult right now and I think if the new
Parliament comes in after the summer break
[SPEAKER_05]: We may see some surprises there and some
initiatives to reform these legal
[SPEAKER_05]: framework on the EU level I'm pretty sure
that will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think some of those surprises will
be positive?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah because the framework
decision from 2004 is under the old legal
[SPEAKER_05]: framework of the EU of the NHTSA framework
and it's politically not really Legitimate
[SPEAKER_05]: legitimate it wasn't decided by the
Parliament.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an off-record decision so to say
and it's not viable for For preventing
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization anymore, but it's in place So
we have to deal with that and if you
[SPEAKER_05]: change that you can go further than
Cannabis cultivation associations and and
[SPEAKER_05]: decriminalization you can then think of
the commercial route and all the tools
[SPEAKER_05]: which are in place on the single
Convention level with intersea agreements,
[SPEAKER_01]: etc Well, I think the other big surprise
that we know is coming is these pilot
[SPEAKER_01]: programs We don't know what that's gonna
look like necessarily But we know with
[SPEAKER_01]: some certainty who the players are gonna
be that are gonna come in with money Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: but those discussions are just starting so
at the pilot projects, of course Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: they announced that they will if the law
passes next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will immediately start working on the
pilot projects and For the pilot projects
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to cultivate cannabis as well in
Germany So it's maybe not a bad idea to
[SPEAKER_05]: start a cannabis cultivation in Germany to
be prepared for Model B for the model
[SPEAKER_05]: projects and for the for the next steps
five six seven years ahead Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe just as a little comment to the
audience also like the pillar two is for
[SPEAKER_06]: evaluating the commercial part so you can
already do and now scientific research and
[SPEAKER_06]: Research in those kind of areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's also something That should be
done way more, but we're gonna open the
[SPEAKER_06]: floor for questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, maybe Michelle your your main
surprise of The next 12 months.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is yours?
[SPEAKER_04]: I also have to wait till next Friday,
I would say and Another surprise is what
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie just mentioned There will be no
legal supply or legal legal possession in
[SPEAKER_04]: the beginning and what we never discussed
so far is That pharmacies they don't pay
[SPEAKER_04]: taxes They pay taxes, but they pay less
taxes And if you look at the pricing right
[SPEAKER_04]: now, and this is also my first question
that maybe may go out to Kai maybe When I
[SPEAKER_04]: look at the pricing of pharmacy right now
Do you think they will be like in
[SPEAKER_04]: competition?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's also in competition with
shops and clubs because it's also as we
[SPEAKER_04]: heard very easy to have a prescription
very soon all the restrictions fall and
[SPEAKER_04]: when I look at the pricing and Pharmacy,
it starts at 550 right now and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: becoming cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think they'll have there'll be in
competition it with the clubs and and
[SPEAKER_05]: shops which will come Yeah If I Would be
allowed to have a proper home grow I
[SPEAKER_05]: probably wouldn't take prescriptions
anymore You know that it's a big it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: huge potential for home grow in in Germany
In every municipality in every county you
[SPEAKER_05]: have at least three head shops selling
stuff and accessories for the last three
[SPEAKER_05]: fourths centuries so it's already there
and it will it will boom definitely if you
[SPEAKER_05]: can do it legally many many people will
try that and But if you look at the demand
[SPEAKER_05]: we were talking about that with bow last
night the how cup study assumes 400 to 600
[SPEAKER_05]: tons Bow Whitney says no, it's 900 tons
Probably 1,000 tons.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you really go if you if the usual
stoner Transforms or switches switches to
[SPEAKER_05]: the medical market.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's enough potential for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no real competition, I guess The
founder of can of Portugal it's an expo on
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp and cannabis in Lisbon and I have a
question to Nehrman because you told a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of times that the new laws of
German implies this protection of your own
[SPEAKER_03]: market and my question is and considering
that most of the all a lot of the product
[SPEAKER_03]: that is Medicinal cannabis that is
produced in Portugal goes to Germany how
[SPEAKER_03]: come in this year European Union free
circulation of goods outcome Germany can
[SPEAKER_03]: close Its borders and protect themselves
Because I think it's the opposite Idea
[SPEAKER_03]: that we have of the European Union.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good point It's not solved yet
because they are two different regimes We
[SPEAKER_05]: have the EU law and we have the single
convention and medical cannabis is traded
[SPEAKER_05]: according to the rules of the single
convention and these over lying or
[SPEAKER_05]: superseding the the principle of the free
movement of goods this is a conflict and
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe if someone starts to To appeal
against these rules Maybe he will be
[SPEAKER_05]: successful if you take it to court.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it says We have to see I'm gonna
translate that for the Americans in the
[SPEAKER_01]: audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you basically have is the same
situation Here that we have there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's federally illegal by EU standards So
if this the member states if Germany as a
[SPEAKER_01]: member state of the EU Passes the law for
the benefit of its citizens They can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: they can do whatever they want in within
the borders of Germany That where the law
[SPEAKER_01]: gets broken is when the when it's crossing
borders When the EU law is broken is when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's crossing borders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have this conflict between the
oversight of the feds of the EU and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on at the state level or the member
state level and So it's not a freely
[SPEAKER_05]: tradable commodity medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's highly regulated It's according to
the single convention and you have to
[SPEAKER_05]: comply with the single convention rules
first There was another question back
[SPEAKER_00]: there yes, hi Jason showered founder of
pack global and modern extractor I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit of a two-tiered question for Kai
From everything I've read regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis and the new changing of
the cannabis laws in Germany It seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really opening the doors for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, what are the what are the
options for?
[SPEAKER_00]: creating consumer packaged goods finished
products Vapes and any of that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and then also how do you fulfill?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it gonna be possible to fulfill that
from within the EU and outside of Germany
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to comply with the monographs
monographies in place which is for dried
[SPEAKER_05]: flowers and for Extract and if you if
these if your products comply with these
[SPEAKER_05]: monographs, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can sell it, but we won't see Medical
vaping devices they are not there yet that
[SPEAKER_05]: no one has an authorization yet for the
European market But companies are working
[SPEAKER_05]: on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah And we would need to have more and
new and modern monographies for New
[SPEAKER_05]: products which would have to be drafted
and you yeah, the industry should take
[SPEAKER_01]: care of that What I predict is that you'll
see Kind of like the social club model
[SPEAKER_01]: here, which I know they're not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happened is Cannabis is not legal
here, but you have these quote-unquote
[SPEAKER_01]: private clubs and they're not supposed To
be selling cannabis, but they all do
[SPEAKER_01]: because it becomes an enforcement issue
and Kai's talking about the government's
[SPEAKER_01]: already complaining Oh, we've got to go
through a hundred thousand They aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: going to fund enforcement That's the
general rule of what happens is the law
[SPEAKER_01]: gets passed and then they don't have they
don't consider They don't think about
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna need to actually put some
money in budgets for enforcement So then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just gonna have people flouting the
law which means then you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_01]: people putting The flower in branded
packages and it's not gonna be allowed but
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, that's my prediction Maybe Kai you
can tell a little bit about the products
[SPEAKER_06]: available in the social clubs and in the
pillar to Yeah in the social clubs,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's only flowers and resin no extracts
Sorry solventless extracts solventless
[SPEAKER_05]: extra Yeah, they are forbidden And no
edibles, of course, but life was in so if
[SPEAKER_05]: it's with pressure and No, no solvent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay and in the model project they
will try to The edibles will be possible
[SPEAKER_05]: under strict evaluation if that is really
as harmful as they expect to be it because
[SPEAKER_05]: now it is not but yeah Edibles will come
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so in the second pillar there is
some potential for more commercial
[SPEAKER_06]: products because that's the focus of the
pillar So our time is over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's give a warm applause to the
panelists Thank you everybody for
[SPEAKER_00]: attending this panel Fantastic,
thank you so much
