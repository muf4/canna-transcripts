[SPEAKER_03]: This is the man who is responsible for
virtually all of the cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wouldn't be able to do any of the
research that we're doing now if it
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He first synthesized and isolated the THC,
the CBD, the CBG, all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wouldn't know anything about it if it
weren't for him, and he's going to come up
[SPEAKER_03]: and talk to us right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, everyone, put your hands together
and welcome to the stage the one and only
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Rafael Mesulam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try for the next half hour to tell
you a little bit about what went on,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going on, and what I hope will
happen in the next few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I started research on cannabis,
and that was quite a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody was interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a matter of fact, when I asked for a
grant, I was told, a grant from NIH in the
[SPEAKER_02]: US, I was told nobody smokes marijuana in
the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do that in Mexico, we think.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have something more relevant,
kindly let us know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they changed their minds shortly
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody important, maybe a senator,
had asked him, what does marijuana do?
[SPEAKER_02]: His son was caught smoking pot,
and he was he wanted to know whether it
[SPEAKER_02]: destroys his mind or something,
and they didn't have a single grant,
[SPEAKER_02]: they didn't know anything about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they came over to Jerusalem at that
time, and took the THC we had isolated and
[SPEAKER_02]: elucidated the structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they smuggled it back because they
didn't have a license to do that,
[SPEAKER_02]: and for the next few years, most of the
work on THC in the States was done with
[SPEAKER_02]: material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Material that was apparently smuggled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things have changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nature, one of the major scientific
journals in the world, had a few reviews,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is from our review, and they put
on the first thing, a brain from which
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason for that is, in the next
slide, a few scientists at NIH,
[SPEAKER_02]: and NIH does a lot of research on cannabis
nowadays, they wrote that modulating the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid activity may have
therapeutic potential in almost all
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases affecting humans, and they give a
lot of examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is a very, very strong
statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know of any other biochemical
system that is involved in almost all
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases affecting humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while it may not be 100% true,
it is close to the truth, and I'll try to
[SPEAKER_02]: explain why and how this happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's start a few years back in my
area of the world, Assyria, and we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of documents left from that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wrote a lot of them on stone and so
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used cannabis for essentially all
those things that we use, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that they had a name,
ganzygunu, that's the drug that takes away
[SPEAKER_02]: the mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a bad definition, but they
thought there was the azalu of the same
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, which was used as a medicine,
apparently for neurological diseases,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not so sure, and they also use it in
their religious rites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis, as we all know, has been used
more or less over the next couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand years, and I'll just give another
example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Russell Reynolds, who was the
physician of Queen Victoria in England,
[SPEAKER_02]: used to import cannabis from India.
[SPEAKER_02]: European cannabis was not good enough for
him because she had migraines,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he didn't write that in his paper,
but it was obvious because she was the
[SPEAKER_02]: only patient he had for the relief of
certain kinds of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe there is no more useful medicine
than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then a lot of research started.
[SPEAKER_02]: The middle of this century we were
involved, and I would like to separate the
[SPEAKER_02]: research that has been going on in three
phases.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one is the phytochemistry,
namely the chemistry of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, most of the people that are involved
in cannabis are involved in the
[SPEAKER_02]: phyto-cannabinoid research on the
materials, the compounds that the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: produces, but these are things that we
learned, described, tried to investigate
[SPEAKER_02]: about 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since then, things have been happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, the endocannabinoid
research, namely research on the compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: and the cannabinoids that we make that all
mammalians do, and this was more or less
[SPEAKER_02]: completed about 10 years ago, and since
then we have gone into the third phase of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid research, and this is
compounds that are more or less the same
[SPEAKER_02]: as the compounds we produce, but they have
different effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a whole system, a lot of
compounds that are very, very much
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in our physiology, and while now,
at the moment, most people are interested
[SPEAKER_02]: in cannabidiol and THC, chances are,
as it happened with cannabidiol,
[SPEAKER_02]: where it had to wait for about 30 years,
chances are that in a meeting like that in
[SPEAKER_02]: about 15 years of now, most of the talks
will be under endogenous cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: under cannabinoids that have more or less
the same structure, but have different
[SPEAKER_02]: effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me try to go into the three phases
of research that I'm speaking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of you who haven't forgotten their
high school chemistry, these are some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the compounds that are present in
cannabis, and we discovered most of them
[SPEAKER_02]: about 50 years ago, 40 years ago,
and all of them are more or less the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: The right-hand side is exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been some differences,
discoveries, but more or less the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the left-hand side are the changes,
and we have today more than 100 compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: of this type, but the two compounds that
most people have been interested in are,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, cannabidiol and we described
the structure of cannabidiol way back,
[SPEAKER_02]: 1963, and we are isolated, I believe,
for the first time in pure form,
[SPEAKER_02]: the active compound, THC, and elucidated
the structure later on, synthesize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these two compounds have been,
of course, the center of interest,
[SPEAKER_02]: and those of you who are involved in
cannabis, whether it's in research or in
[SPEAKER_02]: industrial or commercial aspects,
deal mostly with these two compounds,
[SPEAKER_02]: but these compounds are not natural
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: The natural products are their acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant makes THC acid, cannabidiol
acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the compounds that the plant
makes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We described them many, many years ago and
synthesized them, but we never tested them
[SPEAKER_02]: for a simple reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: These compounds are not stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: The acids break down very easily,
so there hasn't been a lot of work on
[SPEAKER_02]: them, contrary to cannabidiol,
and the reason is they're not stable,
[SPEAKER_02]: so if somebody does research on them,
who knows what they're doing the research
[SPEAKER_02]: on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that on the acid, or is it something
that the acid has broken down?
[SPEAKER_02]: So very few.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very few people were interested in the
acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just a few papers, not too many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I thought, we thought in the lab that
maybe the acids are important by
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves, so we had to stabilize them,
and by a simple chemical reaction,
[SPEAKER_02]: we stabilized them and made a methyl
ester.
[SPEAKER_02]: The chemists amongst you will know what it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made a methyl ester of these compounds,
and the methyl esters turn out to be
[SPEAKER_02]: stable, completely stable, so we could
analyze, we could identify the activity of
[SPEAKER_02]: these compounds, and we've been working on
cannabidiol acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns out that cannabidiol acid is,
in those studies that we have undertaken
[SPEAKER_02]: so far, it is more potent than cannabidiol
itself, so chances are that slowly,
[SPEAKER_02]: to a certain extent, never fully,
but slowly, cannabidiol acid as its methyl
[SPEAKER_02]: ester will parallel cannabidiol in its
activity because in many aspects,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's much more active, and this is the
structure of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of you who remember chemistry will
see that it's the methyl ester,
[SPEAKER_02]: and for example, we have already published
that this cannabidiol acid, which is more
[SPEAKER_02]: stable, reduces depression, like behavior
in two models of animal depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we cannot go into humans
because of regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: One has to go into animals to a large
extent, and even if they are natural
[SPEAKER_02]: products, they have to be investigated for
toxicity and other things, but if we
[SPEAKER_02]: assume that most of the things we see in
animals, in animal models that parallel
[SPEAKER_02]: human models, then this compound,
cannabidiol acid, methyl ester,
[SPEAKER_02]: will show activity stronger than CBD
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a publication in press which shows
that cannabidiol methyl ester is more
[SPEAKER_02]: potent in pain, lowers pain to a much
larger extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have seen, as the slide shows,
depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have seen a few other things,
and these will be published over the next
[SPEAKER_02]: few years, maybe over the next few months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't be surprised in cannabidiol
methyl ester.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starts replacing cannabidiol slowly as the
natural cannabidiol of importance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not cause the THC effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another effect that has gained interest is
the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found, and it has been, of course,
confirmed, by many, many people,
[SPEAKER_02]: both in animals and in humans,
that some of the effects of THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabinoids, in quite a few
cannabinoids, some of the effects are
[SPEAKER_02]: potentiated by compounds that by
themselves have no activity, but they
[SPEAKER_02]: potentiate the activity of THC,
and we call this the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_02]: and although one does not see that in all
effects, of THC or all effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, many of the effects have
this entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things become very complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody wants to put THC as an
extract, or CBD as an extract,
[SPEAKER_02]: one has also to know what are the
compounds that are present there together
[SPEAKER_02]: with these two compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can have a sample that contains a
certain percentage of these central
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds, and another one that has the
same percentage, and yet the activities
[SPEAKER_02]: are somewhat different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we shall have to develop analytical
procedures, at least for most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds that are present in cannabis,
in order to explain the activity and not
[SPEAKER_02]: to sell compounds with a certain
percentage, another compound, another
[SPEAKER_02]: extract with the same percentage,
and yet they are quite different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to show, ultimately, what are the
rest of the compounds or some of the rest
[SPEAKER_02]: of the compounds that are around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the entourage effect,
and we have to take into account entourage
[SPEAKER_02]: effects all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, okay, a few words about THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of you are aware of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has to do with pain, nausea, vomiting,
sleep, anxiety, appetite, quite a few
[SPEAKER_02]: other things, and THC, as you know,
has been approved by many of the bodies in
[SPEAKER_02]: many countries, in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and other countries, and it is a approved
drug, a minor drug, and the reason for
[SPEAKER_02]: that is that people prefer the extract,
possibly because of the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_02]: rather than THC itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So THC has been on the market,
not a major drug, I've been told that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: sold in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: between $100 and $200 million,
which, for a major drug, is nowhere there.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that people have not
investigated very thoroughly is
[SPEAKER_02]: depression, and THC shows significant
antidepressant effect, but the other
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds, like hanabichromine,
for example, show the same effect,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit at higher dose, but they show
the same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should know what's being sold
exactly, whether it's THC, whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: hanabichromine, or whether it's other
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, hanabichromine may be not as active
as THC, but it doesn't cause the side
[SPEAKER_02]: effect, so maybe people will be selling
hanabichromine because of the lack of side
[SPEAKER_02]: effects that people in pain don't want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have published that THC is also
pretty important in post-trauma.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that post-trauma patients take
cannabis in order to lower the effects of
[SPEAKER_02]: post-trauma.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went ahead and did a clinical trial and
found that, indeed, low amounts of THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: which do not cause the high, may help
post-trauma.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a group of about 12 patients,
a few soldiers, a few women that had been
[SPEAKER_02]: raped, a few patients that had PTSD
because of a car accident.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found that, essentially,
all the effects of post-trauma,
[SPEAKER_02]: THC helped.
[SPEAKER_02]: The effect didn't disappear.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were easier to go around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best effect was in sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Post-trauma patients do not sleep well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are afraid to go to sleep because in
the middle of the night, they wake up with
[SPEAKER_02]: a trauma happening again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why they are afraid to go to
sleep and they don't sleep well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we found that with THC, low doses,
they sleep much better, and this is one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the reasons post-trauma patients do take
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's go on with the cannabidiol
actions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, I'll start with epilepsy
because it has been approved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is a paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that we published 1980,
which is almost 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found, this was in collaboration with
colleagues and friends in South America.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found in animals, as was previously
noted in the literature for 2,000 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: that cannabis works on epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looked at cannabidiol first in
animals and then went to humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did that on about 12 patients or 15
patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw that in most of the patients,
it affected positively the epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them had very few attacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few had much less attacks and only one
was not affected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we published that and we thought that
maybe it will be used, that people will do
[SPEAKER_02]: larger trials, and it will be introduced
as a drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing happened for almost 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then parents in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: discovered that plants containing large
amounts of cannabidiol help with the
[SPEAKER_02]: epilepsy of their children, and children
sometimes have terrible epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 attacks a day or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the cannabidiol helped, and they were
going to one of the states where cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: was legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe some of them had known about the
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, why did we have to wait for 30 years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thousands of children, thousands of
patients could have been helped,
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely children.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because of possibly legal problems,
possibly other problems, nobody had taken
[SPEAKER_02]: up the information that was in the
literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, once parents saw that cannabis with a
lot of cannabidiol helps, there was
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure on the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: authorities and a big trial was approved.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very difficult to get clinical trials
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one was approved because of
social pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turned out to be extremely
positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It paralleled what we did, but it was done
in children.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was done in hundreds of children.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now cannabidiol under the name of
Epidiolex is approved as a drug in
[SPEAKER_02]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why, why wasn't that done 30 years ago?
[SPEAKER_02]: We had found that cannabidiol is active in
autoimmune diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Autoimmune diseases are diseases in which
the body, for many reasons, some of which
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't know, attacks itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are a lot of autoimmune
diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, a disease which is close to the
autoimmune diseases is the graft versus
[SPEAKER_02]: host disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes in cancer patients, the bone
marrow has to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the bone marrow is replaced,
the body doesn't like it, and it may
[SPEAKER_02]: attack it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bone marrow itself may attack the
body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the patient suffers, sometimes suffers
very, very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is essentially autoimmune
reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a colleague of mine, Dr. Yeshurun,
went ahead it's a collaboration we had,
[SPEAKER_02]: went ahead and started giving pure
cannabidiol to patients with graft versus
[SPEAKER_02]: host disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was very glad to note that,
yes, in most of the patients which had a
[SPEAKER_02]: relatively mild disease, and this is
called a two to four grade disease,
[SPEAKER_02]: 40% previously had a graft versus host
disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they were taking cannabidiol,
this went down to 12%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those that had real, real bad disease,
GVHD, which was previously 10%,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a few even died, went down to about
5%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have a drug, cannabidiol,
which can be used in this anti-cancer
[SPEAKER_02]: treatment, and it is being developed as a
drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: A company is going ahead with CBD and
GVHD, and I think it's now in phase two,
[SPEAKER_02]: and chances are it will be in phase three
shortly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's hope that within a year or two,
we shall have a drug, CBD, as a potent GVH
[SPEAKER_02]: drug, which there are no other drugs at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, schizophrenia, and I mention that
because it was developed mostly in
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had shown again with my good friends in
South America that it helps in very few
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: We published that many years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had given CBD to a young woman who had
a terrible schizophrenia, and it helped
[SPEAKER_02]: her over three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Leverke in Germany decided to go
ahead, and he made a relatively large or
[SPEAKER_02]: larger trial, and he gave it to patients
that nothing was helping them anymore,
[SPEAKER_02]: schizophrenic patients, and he found that
CBD was an excellent drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: He compared it to one of the drugs that
are already being used, Amisulfide,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this drug, which is a good drug,
has side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, cannabidiol and the drugs that are
already being used have the same activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except that cannabidiol causes no side
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many schizophrenic patients don't want to
take the anti-schizophrenic drugs because
[SPEAKER_02]: of the side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chances are that cannabidiol can replace
these drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the amounts of cannabidiol
are very high, about 800 milligrams per
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's quite high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe, just maybe, with the new drugs
that I was telling you about, Methyl
[SPEAKER_02]: Ester, we can go down to much lower doses,
so these are developments that we shall
[SPEAKER_02]: see in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hope that even now, schizophrenic
patients will be administered cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amounts are very high, about 800
milligrams per day, but it is definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: worth it, and chances are that cannabidiol
will be approved as a drug against
[SPEAKER_02]: schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure that it is approved in any
country at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that in Israel, it is being
discussed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having a meeting next week with the
heads of the Ministry of Health,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm trying to push cannabidiol as an
anti-schizophrenic drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I was telling you about,
that cannabidiol was compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: amisulfide, and it's better in some of the
side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: It causes less weight gain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It causes no changes in estrogen and
testosterone, and it causes a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: different effects, the unpleasant effect
that the present drug, amisulfide,
[SPEAKER_02]: is causing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have probably, well, I believe that
we shall have cannabidiol as
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-schizophrenic drug within the next
year or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are some of the symptoms that
the present drug causes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may cause muscle spasms, it can cause
slowness of movement, tremor, and some
[SPEAKER_02]: other unpleasant types.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one thing, another disease that we
have been working on is diabetes type 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it is an autoimmune disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: The body, for reasons that we don't know,
attacks those cells that produce insulin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the patient, usually that's seen in
children, so diabetes type 1 is a
[SPEAKER_02]: pediatric disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: These children don't have enough insulin,
and they are sick, sometimes very sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found that cannabidiol is extremely
helpful, and in animals, at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not done that in humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have the permits yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have seen that in animals, only 5% of
the cells that produce insulin remain
[SPEAKER_02]: intact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those that are given cannabidiol,
we see that 77% of the cells that produce
[SPEAKER_02]: insulin remain intact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have a major improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, although we published
that quite a few years ago, this disease
[SPEAKER_02]: has not been, or this treatment for the
disease has not been looked into in
[SPEAKER_02]: humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't do everything, and apparently
very few people are interested,
[SPEAKER_02]: although it is a major disease,
and a disease from which quite a few,
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly children, suffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if any of you has enough pressure in
your countries to have a diabetes type 1
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trial with pure cannabidiol,
go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, almost all drugs from natural
products are sold not as the drugs
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves, but as a derivative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reasons for that are, the reasons
are quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, on the natural product,
the patent is not very strong,
[SPEAKER_02]: and by making a small derivative of
cannabidiol, a chemical derivative,
[SPEAKER_02]: usually one can get more potent compounds
and compounds that are better in many
[SPEAKER_02]: ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, today you cannot buy insulin,
you cannot buy penicillin as such.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy a derivative of penicillin in
a drug store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or let's go into cortisone, another major
hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot buy cortisone in a drug store.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy derivatives of cortisone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these derivatives may be sold about
five or six billion dollars a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chances are that cannabidiol within the
next few years will be on the market as a
[SPEAKER_02]: derivative, not as cannabidiol itself,
but as a derivative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here is a derivative that we have
published, and a company is developing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this derivative is a parallel to the
activity of CBD, but is somewhat more
[SPEAKER_02]: potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chances are that in the near future,
or the distant future, we shall have both
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabidiol and cannabidiol derivatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let me go into the phase two of
cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the compound that we make
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: For many reasons, and some of the reasons
we brought into the literature,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was obvious that cannabidiol acts on
something in the body, such as
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically, which may be a receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a group in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: found a receptor, a protein in the body
that THC binds to it, and it starts all
[SPEAKER_02]: the reactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't have receptors because there
is a plant out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have receptors because we make
compounds that will stimulate these
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went ahead looking for compounds and
this receptor was found in all these
[SPEAKER_02]: places that you can see called basal
ganglia, all these places that have to do
[SPEAKER_02]: with movement control and movement
coordination and cognitive function,
[SPEAKER_02]: all these things that people know happen
with THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this receptor was obviously important
and central.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started looking for the compounds
that we make, or animals make,
[SPEAKER_02]: that activate the parallel activity of
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after quite a lot of work,
we found two compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them we called anandamide,
and the second one is known as 2AG,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are chemically completely different,
but have the same activity and the same
[SPEAKER_02]: activity as THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see, and if you've forgotten your
chemistry, that these two compounds,
[SPEAKER_02]: anandamide and 2AG, which animals produce,
and we produce, completely different
[SPEAKER_02]: chemically from THC, but they have the
same physical properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are lipid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They dissolve only in lipids, not in
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: They bind to the same receptor and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anandamide and 2AG have been discussed
widely in the literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are thousands of publications on
anandamide and 2AG, and these compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: are central in the so-called
endocannabinoid system, which consists of
[SPEAKER_02]: the receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two of them, the two compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The enzymes that break down these
compounds help synthesize them,
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course, THC and cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there has been a lot of theoretical
work, or work that has very little
[SPEAKER_02]: relation to marketing and so on,
for a simple reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although we discovered anandamide,
and a little bit later, 2AG, anandamide
[SPEAKER_02]: has never, never been administered to a
human.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, because of mostly legal
reasons, it's not toxic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made by the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we compare that with, let's say,
insulin, insulin was discovered 100 years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago, and in Canada, and within six months,
it became a drug, or within a year,
[SPEAKER_02]: it became a drug, a very useful drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even today, people use insulin as a drug,
more or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anandamide, which has outstanding medical
properties, never been used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legal reasons, patent problems,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is strange, because we know,
in schizophrenia, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: when cannabidiol is administered,
the main effect is that anandamide
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrations go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anandamide concentrations go up,
maybe it is anandamide that's helping,
[SPEAKER_02]: not cannabidiol, but anandamide,
indirectly, there are many other diseases
[SPEAKER_02]: that anandamide has to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's unbelievable, but it has never
been given to a human.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, in animals, it has been looked,
the endocannabinoid system, and it has
[SPEAKER_02]: been found to be involved in a huge number
of physiological effects, starting from
[SPEAKER_02]: anxiety and appetite, this and so on and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see the mood, movement,
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I were to prepare a new slide,
this is a slide of two years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have twice as many physiological
things happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is extremely important, and chances
are that at some point, anandamide,
[SPEAKER_02]: or a derivative of anandamide,
will become a drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you just two examples,
the neuroprotection.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried, with the colleague of ours,
to see whether these compounds are
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in neuroprotection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we tried that for some animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe that any of our friends
would have volunteered to have some kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of brain attack, as we did in poor mice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw that after such a long time,
when they were given a small attack on the
[SPEAKER_02]: brain, not a very strong one, as a matter
of fact, within a couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: they went back to be completely normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw that two AG, one of the two,
endocannabinoids goes up tremendously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is that because the brain being
damaged, didn't know what it was doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that some kind of a protection?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we synthesized a lot of two AG and gave
to animals, and compared to animals not
[SPEAKER_02]: given two AG, and we saw that yes,
the two AG, one of the endocannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: is a potent protectant, if we gave that to
the people that know how to look at these
[SPEAKER_02]: things in the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw that in the controls,
we had a certain amount of damage,
[SPEAKER_02]: the white part that you see, those that
were given two AG, the endocannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_02]: had 50% less.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably, at some point, two AG will be
developed as a drug against brain damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no drug at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite a few people get that kind of
damage, and there is nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are no drugs available today
that can help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one thing that has been found quite
recently, again, in South America,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that CB1 receptors are not only known
to lower anxiety, but quite a few of the
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs that we use today, and we are not
sure of their activity, or we have wrongly
[SPEAKER_02]: assigned some of their activity,
is due to the cannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is, for example, Xanax,
Alprozolam, which is an antigen anxiety
[SPEAKER_02]: drug, a well-known, widely used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, it works through the cannabinoid
receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if this is the case, chances are that
people will develop additional drugs in
[SPEAKER_02]: this respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I mentioned that there are two
receptors, CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_02]: The activation of the CB1 receptor causes
the well-known THC activities,
[SPEAKER_02]: the high and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one, the CB2, does not cause
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a protective receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know some companies, in Switzerland,
at least one company, is developing drugs
[SPEAKER_02]: based on the second receptor that does not
cause these side effects, which are not of
[SPEAKER_02]: importance to a pharmaceutical company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They act only on the CB2 receptor,
not on the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And acting only in the CB2 receptor with
compounds that we have made, or compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: that the companies have made, these CB2
receptors are involved in a huge number of
[SPEAKER_02]: protective mechanisms in heart problems,
in atherosclerosis, in pain,
[SPEAKER_02]: neurodegenerative diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if these companies succeed in
producing compounds and evaluating them,
[SPEAKER_02]: chances are that we shall have drugs that
are not CBD, are not THC, but are based on
[SPEAKER_02]: CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't have the time to go into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can speak for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are compounds that are specifically
acting under CB2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is a few words on the
endogenous cannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is phase two of research.
[SPEAKER_02]: At present, we are working on phase three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And phase three research, is something
else entirely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned anandamide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of you who are chemists will see
that anandamide is a rather simple
[SPEAKER_02]: compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a fatty acid bound to an amino acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have about 20 fatty acids and about 20
amino acids in our body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, our body is lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it knows how to make anandamide,
taking a fatty acid and binding it to an
[SPEAKER_02]: amino acid, why not take the other fatty
acids and the other amino acids and make
[SPEAKER_02]: additional compounds, make use of them so
it won't have to spend energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It already has the machinery to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, we found that this is exactly
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did we go into that?
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw that in brain injury, there is a
brain injury part of the brain injury
[SPEAKER_02]: causes effects and all kinds of
transmitters, glutamate, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ultimately, it causes neuronal and
cell death.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, and these are the things I was
telling you previously, but it also causes
[SPEAKER_02]: brain injury can cause vasoconstriction,
the blood vessels constrict.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the body tries to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw that cannabis extract of
cannabis can help with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we take the brain, another animal
and extract it and give it, it also helps
[SPEAKER_02]: with vasoconstriction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a compound in our body which
helps with vasoconstriction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we went ahead looking for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't know that it has to do anything
that we tend to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just went ahead looking for the
compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after quite a lot of work,
we found that our body helps with
[SPEAKER_02]: vasoconstriction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vasodilation by making a third compound
like anandamide.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does not cause any of the effects
of anandamide.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just helps with the vasoconstriction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It dilates the blood vessels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is something that our body makes
in order to prevent vasoconstriction,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is due to brain damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we block this system, the brain damage
is much higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have a drug, a cannabinoid-like
drug, which has to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: vasoconstriction, vasodilation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I repeat myself all the time,
maybe it will be used as a drug.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is not the only thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that happens is with bones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this was a research project which
we didn't think has anything to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The background of our work on bones was
that it was well known, or it was known,
[SPEAKER_02]: that women after the age of 50,
55, when all the hormones are changed and
[SPEAKER_02]: when all the hormones don't work the way
they did previously, women should have a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of osteoporosis, which they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the osteoporosis in women in the
Mediterranean region is much lower than
[SPEAKER_02]: the osteoporosis in the North,
in Norway, let's say, or even in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we thought, why?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the reason?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a suggestion in the
literature that this is because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: olive oil that's being used around the
Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looked at the olive oil,
and it didn't do anything, but maybe we
[SPEAKER_02]: said it's a derivative, it's a derivative
that our body makes, and we worked quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot on this project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ultimately we found that, yes,
our body makes a compound which is closely
[SPEAKER_02]: related chemically to anandamide,
which again is strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't expect anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought that that's a completely
different research problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we saw that our body, women's body of
course, produces a compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Closely related to anandamide,
and it blocks osteoporosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not completely, but it blocks it very well
indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And doing that, it helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it is not an endocannabinoid,
it is not a THC, but it is closely
[SPEAKER_02]: related.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, a company has taken up this
compound, which is again a fatty acid
[SPEAKER_02]: bound to an amino acid, closely related.
[SPEAKER_02]: Closely related to anandamide,
and when given to mice, works extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're not mice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that it will work in humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it is given, I believe that it will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will just show you one slide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the drugs that we use to get
osteoporosis nowadays, most of the drugs
[SPEAKER_02]: block the destruction of the bones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't cause the bones to be built up
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, the compound that animals
make, that we make, which is closely
[SPEAKER_02]: related to anandamide, it is part of the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: This compound not only blocks the
destruction of the bones, but even helps
[SPEAKER_02]: the bones grow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see in this slide, the first green
thing is what the bones are at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the ovaries and everything else has
been taken out of the mice, in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: parallel what happens in women after the
age of 55, the bones of the animals went
[SPEAKER_02]: down, and it's the red thing we see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has gone down, and they have strong and
potent osteoporosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we start, after 40, 45 days when
we see this, when we start giving them the
[SPEAKER_02]: new cannabinoid-like compound,
we see that the bones not only are not
[SPEAKER_02]: destructed anymore, they even go up and
are being remodeled again, rebuilt again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have a typical example of the
phase three of cannabinoid work,
[SPEAKER_02]: namely fatty acids bound to amino acids
like in anandamide, compounds without
[SPEAKER_02]: psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we have an example of what talking
about and I would like now to summarize,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, another thing that we're actually
working at the moment, it's nicotine
[SPEAKER_02]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get addicted to many compounds,
to many things, including drugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: opium, cocaine, nicotine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, our body looks at nicotine,
at any addiction, certainly also to
[SPEAKER_02]: nicotine addiction, as a disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a disease, then the body will try
to block the disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it block it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we didn't know, but we thought that
maybe our body makes compounds that try to
[SPEAKER_02]: block the disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not go into details.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a long story.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, in this case, was a group of four
research labs, ours, came up with a
[SPEAKER_02]: suggestion, good friends in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: at Richmond, Virginia, good friends in
Canada, and good friends in Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sit together, drink a lot of coffee
together, and discuss how to go ahead,
[SPEAKER_02]: and together we went ahead looking,
how does the body fight nicotine
[SPEAKER_02]: addiction?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found that in certain areas,
certain places in the brain, a compound is
[SPEAKER_02]: formed, which, again, is a fatty acid
bound to amino acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strangely enough, when we started,
we didn't have the foggiest idea that this
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we have an endocannabinoid-like
situation, and this compound blocks an
[SPEAKER_02]: effect which is one of the models it's
called, condition place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Preference, it blocks one of the models of
addiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is conditional place?
[SPEAKER_02]: Reference, you put a mouse in the center.
[SPEAKER_02]: On one hand, you have food with nicotine.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, food on the other side,
food without nicotine.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the beginning, they go 50% here,
50% there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then slowly, they get addicted and go only
to the food that has addiction,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's called condition place
preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could block not only the model,
the condition place preference,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we could block even the withdrawal
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: When people, or mice, are not given
nicotine anymore and they're addicted,
[SPEAKER_02]: they show some kind of anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was tried also in morphine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't block morphine addiction,
but it blocks the withdrawal symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it turns out to do the same in
humans, we can maybe block withdrawal
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms of nicotine, withdrawal symptoms
of morphine, which is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: After all, only in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: there are about 65,000 people that die of
morphine overdose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we can help many of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just as a summary, there are three
phases of cannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them has to do with the plants,
THC, CBD, possibly other compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one has to do with the
endocannabinoids, which are involved in a
[SPEAKER_02]: large number of physiological processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within that story, there are the CB2
receptors, which are specific for many
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases and do not cause the side
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third one is a huge number,
almost 100 compounds that our body makes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we know about the activity of about
five or 10, and chances are they'll see
[SPEAKER_02]: many more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabinoids in the future,
in research, in medicine, certainly in
[SPEAKER_02]: other commercial or non-commercial
aspects, we shall be seeing people going
[SPEAKER_02]: ahead with plant cannabinoids,
the main thing that's being done today,
[SPEAKER_02]: endogenous cannabinoids, which will
probably be developed within the next few
[SPEAKER_02]: years, and an endomite-like compounds,
which will take a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to thank many of my
collaborators quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: All this work is being done with
collaborators.
[SPEAKER_02]: No lab can do everything alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things have to be done in
collaboration, and these are collaborators
[SPEAKER_02]: in Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of collaborators abroad.
[SPEAKER_02]: We meet with some of them, and we discuss
problems from many different sides of
[SPEAKER_02]: science, and hopefully we have succeeded
in doing some things that may be of
[SPEAKER_02]: importance, and maybe we'll do some things
in the future as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more time, Dr. Meshalam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was worth the price of admission
already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we have time for one, maybe we have
time for one question, one question,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please be brief.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're running over already, so please,
no stories, just questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Professor Meshalam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Henanit Koltei from Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, to the best of my
knowledge, only THC was shown to bind CB1
[SPEAKER_01]: and CB2 with high affinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is the mode of action of
the other phytocannabinoids, which may not
[SPEAKER_01]: bind CB cannabinoid receptors with high
affinity?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have information about the mode of
action of cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not bind to the receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It binds very weakly as an antagonist,
but not significantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does quite a lot of other things,
and it affects a lot of other systems,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it is strange that we see no side
effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: It affects, and I will not go into the
whole list of mechanisms that are known
[SPEAKER_02]: for CB2.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does all these things, and I'm
surprised that we don't see any side
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact is that it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why it does so many things, I'm not so
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that people are looking at the
moment, and it may be very basic,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is one of the few compounds that
acts on DNA itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly with drugs, we see effects on the
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here has been found that CBD acts on DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes the activity of the specific
DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe, just maybe, if there is a
disease of some kind, and this is due to
[SPEAKER_02]: DNA producing something too much of it,
maybe what CBD does, it goes to that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular part of the DNA and blocks it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there has been some work in Italy
which shows that it acts in, sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: as I believe they looked into,
it acts on the DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chances are that this is the main
activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, this is something that people
are working on at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anujas Sivakoti from Medifarm Labs,
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for that interesting
talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you speak slowly and louder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does CBD's two different stereoisomer have
different effects in the body?
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is a compound, which I didn't go into
it, which has a mirror image.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the plus CBD and the minus CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: The natural product is the minus CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very little work has been done on the
mirror image.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plus CBD, surprisingly,
some work that we did I think 30 years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago, we found that some of the effects of
the minus CBD are also seen with the plus
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD, which is unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as I said, since then nothing has been
done on the plus CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plus THC also does not cause the side
effects, does not cause the effects of
[SPEAKER_02]: THC, but it has been shown that it lowers
brain damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Meshallam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
