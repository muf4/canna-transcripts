[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys for staying for the last
panel of the event.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's been a long couple days,
so I appreciate you guys all coming out
[SPEAKER_06]: and participating still.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Clinton Young.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am the president and founder of
Charlie's Farmers Market, which is a
[SPEAKER_06]: medical cannabis dispensary chain that
will be coming to market in the next few
[SPEAKER_06]: months.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the former CEO of MMJ Canada,
which is one of the largest black market
[SPEAKER_06]: dispensary chains in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been fighting for legalization
and the cannabis plant for over 14 years
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to introduce the panel
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start with Jordan Wegman.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jordan, tell everybody a little bit about
yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Jordan Wegman.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a classically French trained chef and
cookbook author.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the host of a podcast called In the
Weeds that some of you have been guests
[SPEAKER_07]: of.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really happy to be traveling and
educating people on infusing cannabis into
[SPEAKER_07]: food and beverage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Benjamin Paddock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everybody.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my name is Benjamin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I work for a company called Boveda.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're the producers of this
open-on-the-back, so it's two-way
[SPEAKER_05]: ready-to-control.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in charge of all the international
markets, basically, at Boveda.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, Kyle George.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everybody.
Hi, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm Kyle George.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out of Toronto, Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm another Canadian here, so thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm with Maritech, and we've been
around since 67.
[SPEAKER_04]: We focus on specialized equipment for a
variety of industries, including food,
[SPEAKER_04]: pharma, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been doing a lot in the cannabis
and hemp industry for about eight years
[SPEAKER_04]: now, and it's about 67%.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of our business and growing,
so it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to talk about
sustainability, and we kind of switched
[SPEAKER_06]: the topic a little bit from safety to
education.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in Canada anyways, and I know a
lot of markets, they overregulate the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis plant, which means it's probably
one of the safest industries out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I felt like education is probably a
more suitable fit for the topic that we
[SPEAKER_06]: were speaking on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just going to start with you,
George, because you're right beside me.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the type of things that you're
wanting to do and aiming for to make your
[SPEAKER_06]: brand and sector more sustainable,
and how do you plan on educating these
[SPEAKER_06]: people during the process of this?
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I talk about this at Nausium.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the real opportunity in cannabis
is not to educate or necessarily create
[SPEAKER_07]: products for stoners like me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm easy to create products for.
[SPEAKER_07]: The real opportunity is, how do you create
products for my mom?
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you solve for specific needs
states?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it goes into, how do we actually
create that food and beverage that is
[SPEAKER_07]: healthier?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel as though, and I'm saying this
to you in the green room, that I feel like
[SPEAKER_07]: we've really gotten backwards,
where if you think about product
[SPEAKER_07]: formulation as a relay race, we've started
the relay race with this food scientist,
[SPEAKER_07]: rather than a culinary or mixologist who
uses their palate for a living,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then actually passes that baton and
that chain of custody to someone who can
[SPEAKER_07]: work with shelf stability and scaling and
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I find that there's really a lot of the
same on the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that as we start talking
about, or we continue talking about what
[SPEAKER_07]: health and wellness looks like and medical
looks like in the cannabis space,
[SPEAKER_07]: that we really have to look at
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_07]: And why are we including refined sugar?
[SPEAKER_07]: And sugar is something that we're actually
calling health and wellness or medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now do you find with the new demographic
of people that you're trying to hit,
[SPEAKER_06]: the non-plastic stoner, like you said,
which is very easy to appease,
[SPEAKER_06]: do you find you have a lot of hurdles
being a private chef that's doing private
[SPEAKER_06]: infused cannabis culinary?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you find it hard to market and educate
these new things that we need to speak
about?
If I told you the number of, you know,
I work with sick children's hospital,
[SPEAKER_07]: I work with a number of Jewish foundations
and not-for-profits across, and I'm very
[SPEAKER_07]: proud of all the philanthropy that I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all throughout the pandemic,
there was one topic they wanted to talk
[SPEAKER_07]: about virtually, that's cannabis food and
beverage.
[SPEAKER_07]: People want to understand it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to understand it better.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I say it like this, and my
brilliant brother wrote these words,
[SPEAKER_07]: so I certainly will take credit for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we are not going to reach these people
by handing them raws or zigzags and some
[SPEAKER_07]: flowers and go and roll your joints.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to say, here's tomato sauce.
[SPEAKER_07]: You already use it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take your mint tea.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have any sugar in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually has some turbines in it and it
has the benefits that you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever that case may be.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just, I think there's, there's bigger
opportunities out there, especially to
[SPEAKER_07]: educate those that are supposedly
educating others.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a big part of the
opportunity too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now Ben, Boveda clearly for years now has
been leading in humidity packs and keeping
[SPEAKER_06]: your cannabis healthy, clean and
stabilized.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sustainability for yourself,
you know, clearly Boveda is actively doing
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been in the market for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so with cigars and multiple other
products.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is there anything that Boveda is going
to be doing in the future that's going to
[SPEAKER_06]: be accelerating sustainability even more
for you guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like certainly as a company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we are constantly innovating.
[SPEAKER_05]: For instance, we just introduced like the
Boveda principle into a cap.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just grew onto like the standard,
like drop plastic jar and things like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we take the same principle and like
we're basically a one-two pony.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, with that one trick,
we survived 25 years and we still grow a
[SPEAKER_05]: 30% year to date, you know, as a 25 year
old company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, thanks to us being able to have
a myriad of use cases for our application,
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis being one of the more fun ones,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we do a ton of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for us, I mean, we're constantly
innovating, even though it might just be
[SPEAKER_05]: small changes, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But we, and this goes back to our
leadership, sustainability is a big part
[SPEAKER_05]: also about the culture that we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really like a community, almost like
a cult.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you talk to people, they work at
Boveda, they're all like, ooh,
[SPEAKER_05]: they were raving, but it's almost like a
cult because everybody's so passionate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so forward thinking, it's really
amazing, I have to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you guys got a great education team
that I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are great educators and it's
something that is crucial because,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, leading back to the original
panel where we were speaking of safety,
[SPEAKER_06]: safety, you know, comes with education.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for us, I mean, our product is very
simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, if you really want to explain
how it works, there are two ways of doing
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Either educate it, just have people try it
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for you, I mean, if you just have,
hey, you just try it out, it doesn't work
[SPEAKER_05]: in your case.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too complicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works in our case, luckily.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but no education is vital for
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's just, we have a very niche
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just about boisterous cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, we can all agree that dry weed
just sucks, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when it's too moist,
it's also bad because the other microbes,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so it's like bad for your
health, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you need something that will keep it
just right in between.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is what we luckily do,
what we just haven't just grew on us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're the one from Pony, which is,
that's what we do.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an awesome product.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will give you five bucks later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Kyle, you know, Maritech's been
around the space, like we were spoken
[SPEAKER_06]: about earlier, for decades in multiple
different markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just learned about your new vapor static
distraction this week, which is very
[SPEAKER_06]: something new to me, something that I
never even seen or heard of yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you break down the process of
your extraction, what your team does and
[SPEAKER_06]: your plan for sustainability and also
educating moving forward in your sector.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, the vapor static extraction,
it's a very new type of technology that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're taking to market right now,
where we're really changing up the
[SPEAKER_04]: extraction game with a big focus on
saving, reducing the amount of solvents
[SPEAKER_04]: and going completely solventless,
being better for the environment and also
[SPEAKER_04]: reducing the amount of electrical needs to
extract as we're helping our clients
[SPEAKER_04]: become much more sustainable in their
processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we do with it is we actually
vaporize the cannabis and then we use as a
[SPEAKER_04]: technology called electrostatic
precipitation to recondense it from a
[SPEAKER_04]: vapor back into an oil form.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we also do other things in regards to
ethanol, CO2, water extraction types.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's a new solution that we're
taking to market right now, where it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: much more sustainable option, a lot more
easier to operate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also from an education standpoint,
an operator team, a lot simpler,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: One operator can easily run be it 100
pounds a day or 5,000 pounds a day,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a very much more sustainable
technology too for the environment as well
[SPEAKER_04]: with going to a completely solventless
pace.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, when we spoke earlier on,
we spoke about how you're doing the
[SPEAKER_06]: thousand pound a day machines right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you explained the price to me
that it may scare certain people away,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you came back with a great answer and
it actually extremely excited me for the
[SPEAKER_06]: small people to be able to operate these
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys will be coming out with 100 and a
400 pound extraction machine well for the
[SPEAKER_06]: smaller clients as well, correct?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going down to a hundred pound
a day system and that's over 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So someone looking to just operate,
let's say 30, 40 pounds within a shift,
[SPEAKER_04]: it would be perfect for that type of
person and individual too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to me, you know, with Charlie's
Farmer's Market and Sustainability and
[SPEAKER_06]: being a retail store, especially with
medical cannabis, it's very important,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, that education on medical
cannabis is the most important as Alex has
[SPEAKER_06]: mentioned before, the lack thereof in the
cannabis space right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think more education is important.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think to create any type of
sustainability, it starts with the
[SPEAKER_06]: regulators because there's a lot of
regulations in Canada that they put into
[SPEAKER_06]: place that doesn't always give us the
freedom to do what we need to do to maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: make the industry more sustainable and or
educate better.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hoping that lobbying the right
different sectors and creating more
[SPEAKER_06]: sustainable products, whether it's hemp
containers instead of plastic containers,
[SPEAKER_06]: like Canada's got more plastic in their
container.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to me, there's multiple ways to stay
sustainable and educate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that everybody here gave a
really great explanation on each parts of
[SPEAKER_06]: their industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for that, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there's any questions or if anybody
needs to add anything else, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I want to say is that, especially
being in Germany and me being German,
[SPEAKER_05]: that we look at the issue, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are where you guys have been.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we're trying to learn,
you know, from other more level of art,
[SPEAKER_05]: like the Canada stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, this is a giant
thing to do, like to legalize a drug,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and create a market that has
been existing in a regulated form.
[SPEAKER_05]: The market's already there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been part of it before.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so there's a lot of fears,
obviously, and fear is always a bad
[SPEAKER_05]: advice, of course, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's it goes to the contrary of what
would be sustainable in most of the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you talked about just education
and which, you know, I'm sure Alex was
[SPEAKER_07]: alluding to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it makes it very difficult
for us to do what we need to do when all
[SPEAKER_07]: of our friends and colleagues are being
deplatformed and shadow banned on
[SPEAKER_07]: Instagram and Facebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't really go out and, you know,
the market is standing right there.
We're sitting right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, there are creative ways to
educate, and people love anecdotal
[SPEAKER_07]: evidence.
[SPEAKER_07]: People love to hear stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I talk at length about how I removed
gluten-carrying refined sugar and began
[SPEAKER_07]: consuming cannabis, and in 60 days,
I healed myself from my psoriasis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or my father came home from Florida six
months ago and has a big fat brain tumor
[SPEAKER_07]: and now is on 2,000 milligrams of
different cannabinoids every single day
[SPEAKER_07]: and played golf with my son three weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: That shit is powerful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that, those are the stories we need
forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, do you think, George, when we're
telling our stories, because we spoke
[SPEAKER_06]: about this upstairs, which is very
important, I think whether it's mental
[SPEAKER_06]: health, psoriasis, Parkinson's,
all the things that we need to educate on
[SPEAKER_06]: topics that aren't being really educated
on, I think it's very important and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: up to us to do our due diligence to remind
these people that although say what works
[SPEAKER_06]: for you was psoriasis and or with my ADHD
and PTSD, that specific cannabis- We're an
[SPEAKER_06]: end of one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're an end of one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Deb Kimla said that on In the Weeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I give her all the credit.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Weeds, great podcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, she was, she's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 100%.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are an end of one.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, and here's the but, you're gonna
employ cannabis, you know, I'm just saying
[SPEAKER_07]: in my lane here, but you're gonna employ
cannabis with an unhealthy diet.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll tell you, I don't even bother
spending your money on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis combined with a healthy
lifestyle, now we're talking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's sort of, if you break that back
to, you know, the soap box and all the
[SPEAKER_07]: shit that's on the market where all of
it's got corn syrup or some sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: refined sugar and it's supposed to be
solving for a need state, you've got
[SPEAKER_07]: something like refined sugar that's
causing inflammation combining it with
[SPEAKER_07]: something like cannabis that's supposed to
lower our inflammation and what's the net
[SPEAKER_07]: result?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's negligent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's exactly what we did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pre-legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was the main thing that we did.
[SPEAKER_06]: We united as groups and we fought and we
fought so hard to the point where the
[SPEAKER_06]: regulators finally broke.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I don't understand is and when Kyle,
you're making such an amazing point,
[SPEAKER_06]: it just triggered me.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I don't get is now that they
legalized the plant and we've just
[SPEAKER_06]: accepted every little regulation that they
put in 10 milligrams into your headables.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give somebody sugar diabetes before they
can actually get medicated from the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many things that we have just
chosen to accept because they've given us
[SPEAKER_06]: what we wanted with regulations that no
one's fighting in the House of Commons
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one's fighting in the provincial
levels.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want all the legal companies to go back
the way the legacy companies fought and
[SPEAKER_06]: fight for the things that they want and
change because they're not going to get in
[SPEAKER_06]: trouble for fighting these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: The worst case scenario, it turns out to
be a no.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they give a shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they care.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to say, whenever big corporations
or marketers come into play, they just
[SPEAKER_05]: fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, at the end of the day,
when your stock price becomes more
[SPEAKER_05]: important, they're back at sustainability,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: When your stock price becomes the most
important aspect of your day-to-day
[SPEAKER_05]: operations, then something is wrong,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very true.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then to add to education, and we have
to fund research.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there's not enough funding and
research.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to fund research because I think
cannabis is a magical plant, but it's only
[SPEAKER_05]: magical because we don't know how it
works.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are ways to decipher this at some
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And figure out the positives to the
negative.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you need?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which of the potentially 500 cannabis you
need for your ailment?
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably won't need all the 500.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to buy it out and then wait for
better treatment in the initial space and
[SPEAKER_05]: also for more fun in the regression space.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anybody that has any questions
for the group?
[SPEAKER_06]: More remarks?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hand up down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Halison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Halison.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to say hi to everyone,
specifically my lovely, brilliant friend,
[SPEAKER_03]: Jordan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all for talking about these
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's amazing to be in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what most of the Canadians
on the panel are articulating and seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody as the industry is starting to
build.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to touch on what you were
saying about the regulators having sat on
[SPEAKER_03]: the Industry Association Board in Canada,
and I was privileged to meet with Health
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada, the head of each department,
twice a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can promise you that change probably
doesn't come through pushing on regulators
[SPEAKER_03]: as much as it does from communities just
saying, we're just not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think what we saw in Canada,
and I keep encouraging my European friends
[SPEAKER_03]: here, I'm like, don't follow all the
rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: There have been very, very few
consequences and they're all very busy and
[SPEAKER_03]: all very overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you would be surprised where you could
find those moments.
[SPEAKER_07]: Halison is the former CEO of 48 North.
[SPEAKER_06]: The federal regulators and the provincial
government regulators, they're nearly
[SPEAKER_06]: impossible to deal with, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're right that being a community
and getting the message out that way
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes is the better way to get
progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Push the envelope with the rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do believe at some point
communication between the two of the
[SPEAKER_06]: people pushing the rules and regulators,
there needs to be at least a topic of
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and there is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there has to be, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, as a German, we love
rules, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're following us, I'm going to...
Yeah, I've seen you at your red lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a question over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyle and then anyone else too,
but has your company developed or looked
[SPEAKER_02]: at or tried to figure out what to do with
what is about 85% of the material that's
[SPEAKER_02]: waste that comes out of the extraction
process, or are there plans to do that or
[SPEAKER_02]: have you thought about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, great, great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my father is a big mentor of mine,
and he does a lot in other recycling
[SPEAKER_04]: industries, especially plastics and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of his favorite trade sayings is
trash is cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of opportunities.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my things I'm most passionate about
with the hemp in the cannabis plant is
[SPEAKER_04]: there's so much that can be done with this
and so many other building products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's heard about different building
products, hemp crepe, insulation,
[SPEAKER_04]: the fibers can be utilized in clothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's an area where it's also about
us pushing as an industry for these to be
[SPEAKER_04]: adopted more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Surprisingly, a lot of us up here are more
focused on the extraction right now and
[SPEAKER_04]: growing aspect of the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of my very large, large,
large hemp clients, a lot of their focus
[SPEAKER_04]: right now, there's a lot of movement going
into especially the fiber, the herd and
[SPEAKER_04]: utilizing a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as that starts to move forward more
and more, it'll be easier to adopt
[SPEAKER_04]: offshoots from your industry and find
buyers for that spent material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, one thing I do want to chime in to
one of the beauties of the vapor static
[SPEAKER_04]: extraction process too, is it's like if
you put a, if you have like a pack
[SPEAKER_04]: student, you put a little bit of a butt in
there and you burn it on a light setting
[SPEAKER_04]: and it comes out like a light brown,
that's how the material comes out after
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like it's being demolished or
crushed or so full of solvents and hard to
[SPEAKER_04]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from that then too, you can easily take
this material and put it into pelletized
[SPEAKER_04]: feed or other options too, or even using
it as a fibrous product in different
[SPEAKER_04]: building materials and other things too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you people are starting to scale and
look at how they're building up their
[SPEAKER_04]: facilities, at the end of the day,
margins matter and optimization matters.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you can find value in your waste
stream, that helps make you even more
[SPEAKER_04]: profitable, which then allows you to also
make product more affordable to the
[SPEAKER_04]: masses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, we're working a lot on a few
other things on that aspect and maybe we
[SPEAKER_04]: can chat some more after this as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody else have any, oh,
Mr. Rebich.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's not, you're going to do,
you're going to create one right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, the fact of the matter is
there has to be some sort of governing
[SPEAKER_07]: body to issue this certification.
[SPEAKER_07]: So who is that governing body in culinary?
[SPEAKER_07]: Ideally, it's the culinary schools,
which is why the American Culinary
[SPEAKER_07]: Federation has brought a culinary program
online and this is coming online.
[SPEAKER_07]: So from that standpoint, I think that
cannabis as part of the mixology and sort
[SPEAKER_07]: of culinarians journey, that will just be
table stakes as time goes by.
[SPEAKER_07]: For now, you can't be a certified culinary
cannabis professional.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just no governing body.
[SPEAKER_07]: There definitely does need to be something
and I think it will happen in time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Alison said though, if we just break
the rules and create our own governing
[SPEAKER_06]: body, it might force them to allow this
scenario.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a heavy lift, my brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to add into that too, one thing is,
yeah, it's not about just creating,
[SPEAKER_04]: like you're saying, like everybody's kind
of pushing individually, but it's also not
[SPEAKER_04]: about like having an extractor
association, a culinary chef organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in my previous life where I was in
plastics as well, like I used to sit on
[SPEAKER_04]: the boards for like the APR Association of
Plastic Recyclers and NAPCOR as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: North American Post-Consumer Recycling
Organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in these organizations, what you would
have is on these boards, you'd have
[SPEAKER_04]: companies that were from all different
aspects of the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'd have manufacturers of technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd have groups that focused on testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd have groups that focused on turning
those plastics, be it into clothing or
[SPEAKER_04]: carpets or bottles or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody would work together to
basically create a cohesive voice as a
[SPEAKER_04]: sector, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you put together, be it like your
recycling cans, the number system,
[SPEAKER_04]: what is considered a recyclable product,
what is not considered recyclable.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to do the exact same thing
together, but as a unit in unison,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are a couple of organizations
that are starting, but there's also too
[SPEAKER_04]: many if that makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got to find a way to bring those
organizations together as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I think that's also the maturity
of the market at the end, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take Germany for instance.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have basically one major industry
association and they would cover
[SPEAKER_05]: everything and it makes sense because if
you legalize cannabis, of course you have
[SPEAKER_05]: to look at hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course you have to look at CBD and all
that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just an island.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from us as an economy and as a country,
we have to have a holistic approach now,
[SPEAKER_05]: but of course in the future this will be
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the market ensures you have more
players, if you have different groups that
[SPEAKER_05]: will form, I think it's part of a natural
life cycle too, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny, we have these content leaders
out there and my mom raised a mensch so I
[SPEAKER_07]: certainly won't say them by name,
but they curate content that's just
[SPEAKER_07]: incorrect.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just not correct when it comes to how
to infuse culinary or food and beverage
[SPEAKER_07]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And unfortunately, whether we want to
believe it or not, we are still so nascent
[SPEAKER_07]: in many respects in North America and I
live in a federally legalized environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have so far to go in terms of getting
this right and having these thought
[SPEAKER_07]: leaders at the top of the food chain who
actually know what they are talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you have the biggest of the big
information companies that are slinging
[SPEAKER_07]: all this content and it's wrong,
I mean what kind of message are we
[SPEAKER_07]: sending?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then unfortunately you have a lot of
these periphery companies that are out
[SPEAKER_07]: there that are linking to this sort of
mother ship and it all goes back to
[SPEAKER_07]: curating incorrect information.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that it just speaks to how
nascent we are.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get there, but it's just going to
take some time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also hope that it's a little bit of a
cultural difference there because I ain't
[SPEAKER_05]: to just hit on all the Anglo-Saxon in
America, but American advertising
[SPEAKER_05]: marketing is very different from what we
do in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody is the best and the biggest and
it wouldn't be illegal to have that as a
[SPEAKER_05]: marketing claim in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a very niche product.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's even so much disinformation that
brought in from other companies that are
[SPEAKER_05]: in the same marketplace about our product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically I have to give a 45 minute
speech just to debunk all that
[SPEAKER_05]: misinformation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's also a part and I hope that
Europe will be a little bit different
[SPEAKER_05]: because nobody everybody wants to grow,
but I feel like especially I said everyone
[SPEAKER_05]: wants to be the best and the biggest and
everybody will do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a mantra.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grand presence is massive in North America
and it's almost problematic to be honest
[SPEAKER_06]: with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say we can't lump Canada
and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: together because I think our environment
is going to be even more restrictive than
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany and we can't even, it's all
warning labels and you can't really brand
[SPEAKER_03]: market advertise so they're two very
different markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think Germany might even be less
strict than Canada ultimately.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't bet on that to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: The difference is Germany, just to your
point, is that on a societal level we
[SPEAKER_05]: don't have a wide public that's falling.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just really have 50-50.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a divide really between the
young and the old people and we have a
[SPEAKER_05]: very old society right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the divider goes right through it and
that divider is, one of them is Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it will be, I think this is why also
knowing how the legislative process work
[SPEAKER_05]: and knowing that in our second chamber
like what would be the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: Senate when we have the different states,
they have a conservative leadership
[SPEAKER_05]: majority, sorry, we have a conservative
majority in this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to make it work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to go through the second chamber as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could really see that as being very
conservative and also you want to have to
[SPEAKER_05]: come back to sustainability when it comes
to policy making.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, so you don't want to have,
you want to have a policy or regulatory
[SPEAKER_05]: framework that would not be overthrown by
the next government if there was a change
[SPEAKER_05]: as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wouldn't bet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope that I'm wrong, but I have fear
and I'm German so I'm pessimistic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, I'm allowed to be pessimistic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to be clear that I'm talking
not to the process to get there,
[SPEAKER_03]: but when you get there and there's like a
pack of cigarettes, like this is a German
[SPEAKER_03]: pack of cigarettes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what they make here.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Canada, every company, whether you're
Marlboro, anyone, you can't see,
[SPEAKER_03]: they must use the same color, same pack,
same font, no logo.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just shows that we have better tobacco
lobbyists in Europe, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think that does it for the panel,
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of you speaking it out for two
whole days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been the International Cannabis
Business Conference for LID 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
