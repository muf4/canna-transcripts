[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our next panel is on media and marketing
in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got a lot of heavy hitters from all
over the world for this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to lead this panel, he's the head of
nicotine and cannabis research for Euro
[SPEAKER_07]: Monitor International.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for Shane McGill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shane McGill.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a very shy and retiring panel
for you here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis Media and Marketing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Firstly, before I begin, just to help the
panel, can I just do a show of hands to
[SPEAKER_08]: see who's actively currently marketing a
cannabis product or service?
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're actively currently marketing
one.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those of the rest, I guess,
are planning to do so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And who's intending to be in the space?
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of you guys are just observing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And are you marketing to the final
consumer or B2B, those of you who are
[SPEAKER_08]: marketing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Final consumer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hands up.
[SPEAKER_08]: B2B.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: That says a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you guys have a sense of what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to ask you to do the hard
work for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you guys can join me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in San Francisco, where I'm from,
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've helped build a lot of legacy
brands in the cannabis space from both
[SPEAKER_03]: sales and marketing perspective,
both as a consultant and as an employee,
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of different brands that have made
big progress over the last couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: decades in the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really excited to share everything
of my experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a master's in education,
and I'm a teacher.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is really important to my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so thanks to you all for being
lifelong learners with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Steven.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello there.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name's Steven Verbeek.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to see a lot of friendly faces
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been speaking at ICBC since the
origin as well, back in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the CEO of Hello Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're originally based out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our main foray was into the medical
cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have a clinic that is operating
to this day under the Goodbye Opioids
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello Cannabis campaign with over 7,000
patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: We advise numerous countries
internationally as well as helping with
[SPEAKER_05]: legislation as well as marketing
initiatives and how to be able to regulate
[SPEAKER_05]: educating doctors, pharmacists,
and producers and patients alike.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were fortunate enough to be able to
have a brand and a presence to be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: open up the very first legal cannabis
store in a G20 nation that was federally
[SPEAKER_05]: legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was under the brand of Hello
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We opened, I believe that was three and a
half years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: We since expanded, of course, but I do
truly believe that the medical aspect is
[SPEAKER_05]: near and dear to my heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the marketing campaigns and
initiatives and rules and regulations vary
[SPEAKER_05]: dramatically between the two, particularly
internationally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm happy to be able to share some
advice and guidance on what worked and
[SPEAKER_05]: what definitely did not work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I urge you not to do the things that
definitely didn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have repercussions.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure, we'll get into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Michael, can you give us a quick
introduction, please?
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Michael Knod.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm based in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_04]: My profession is I'm a freelance
journalist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working or writing about cannabis
since 20 years meanwhile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides, I'm a book author.
[SPEAKER_04]: I published the first German book on
cannabis extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also run a quite successful YouTube
channel on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm also what they call an influencer
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Due to that, I'm also very involved with
the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a brand ambassador for Avai,
which is one of the biggest German import
[SPEAKER_04]: companies for medical cannabis owned by
the Sanity Group.
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides that, I also do a lot of articles
for Vice Magazine and other cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: mainstream publications.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Simon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: It means a lot for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am Simon Espinosa.
[SPEAKER_06]: I founded, created and founded a media for
the cannabis community in Latin America.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has grown quite a bit since the we're
turning 10 years this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's super big for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that media gave birth to a fully
integrated supply chain with distribution
[SPEAKER_06]: and marketing and retail companies that
are part of this ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has worked very well for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're expanding through the rest of
the Spanish-speaking cannabis markets and
[SPEAKER_06]: communities, landing into the US hopefully
soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some traction in California and
Florida.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are really interesting markets,
cannabis are Spanish-speaking wise.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, we've had a blast.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wrote a couple of books also.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do a lot of content for underage
prevention in schools, local schools in
[SPEAKER_06]: Chile, where I'm from, hopefully in the
rest of the countries coming soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can Google Envolado.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really proud of that project.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a panel with a really pleasingly
diverse range of experience here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought what I could do is maybe
start with some of the problems and then
[SPEAKER_08]: we'll work into solutions and maybe end on
a more positive note.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've got an industry here where you
can't do things that you can do in other
[SPEAKER_08]: industries.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got a mix of different approaches,
channels.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got restrictions that vary across
different markets and so on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, an open question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Could I ask you guys just to talk about
what are some of the big problems,
[SPEAKER_08]: challenges that you face in your own sort
of part of the industry and maybe begin to
[SPEAKER_08]: talk about how you've addressed some of
those and we can kind of go from there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who wants to start on that one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you mind if I jump on this quick?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, here's a fun audience
participation one here.
[SPEAKER_05]: With a show of hands, how many people know
of the company KKE or what it represents?
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Literally zero.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, with a show of hands, how many
people know the name Wiz Khalifa?
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so KKE is Khalifa Kush Enterprises,
which is Wiz Khalifa's company.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this kind of shows exactly how much an
impact Wiz Khalifa has had in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry under KKE.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's even heard of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had some very interesting situations in
Canada where immediately we wanted to have
[SPEAKER_05]: celebrity endorsements for all of these
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there has to be an example in
some other country, so forgive me if I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: being overly presumptuous here,
but I don't know of a single celebrity
[SPEAKER_05]: that endorses a pharmaceutical
prescription product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see Bill Murray saying,
I like Viagra, you should take it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, a lot of these companies in
Canada were throwing millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_05]: at celebrities thinking that they could
endorse these products.
[SPEAKER_05]: At that time, it was only medical.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was not recreational.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you had celebrities that were endorsing
a product that's only available via
[SPEAKER_05]: prescription, which has essentially never
happened before.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see right now how big an impact it
was.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't throw him under the bus.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a friend of mine, but the gentleman
that was running the company that did that
[SPEAKER_05]: wasted a cool $2.5 million on that to have
literally zero impact for an international
[SPEAKER_05]: rap artist that, I don't know,
he's probably got like 100 million
[SPEAKER_05]: followers or something stupid like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not an influencer.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we did notice is when things
transitioned to recreational, a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: those marketing rules transitioned from
both medical over to recreational as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what I found fascinating because
when you start looking at recreational
[SPEAKER_05]: things, you should be able to have
celebrity endorsements.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should be able to have people that
say, I prefer Heineken over this.
[SPEAKER_05]: That happens very commonly.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Canada, it did not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's another fun one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody know the company LBS?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so we have two people.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's Snoop Dogg.
[SPEAKER_05]: LBS is Snoop Dogg.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leafs by Snoop.
[SPEAKER_05]: How strong is your marketing campaign when
the whole name and entity behind it is
[SPEAKER_05]: stripped right down to an acronym,
there's no value there?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rather interesting when you start
looking at these rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I highly recommend steering away from
endorsements with respect to celebrities.
[SPEAKER_05]: They like getting paid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not seen a single one of these
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably the biggest mistake that
I've seen major companies make.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you heard me allude earlier,
I said there are serious repercussions.
[SPEAKER_05]: These repercussions were to the tune of
over $10 million and in my opinion was
[SPEAKER_05]: critical to bankrupt a company before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to compliment that comment,
I think that it's very interesting the
[SPEAKER_06]: difference between celebrities and
communities even though they both have
[SPEAKER_06]: massive traction in social media
especially is not the same and the quality
[SPEAKER_06]: of the follower or subscriber is not going
to be the same and their disposition or
[SPEAKER_06]: their availability for engaging with
whatever content is coming from there is
[SPEAKER_06]: going to switch and transition very
strongly even if it's the same follower
[SPEAKER_06]: from Snoop Dogg that's watching this
content in his platform or if it's in a
[SPEAKER_06]: different platform that is an actual
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is very important to define.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to come back to social media
for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Luna, what are the biggest challenges you
face in terms of the work you're doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In California, we sell cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: How is cool sold in the states and in most
of the world?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had major issues with the terms and
conditions not being favorable on
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram, not being able to use hashtags,
not being able to consume on camera,
[SPEAKER_03]: not being able to getting shadow banned or
blocked from being searchable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that in a lot of ways,
to your point too, this is not a normal
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer packaged goods and I think that
that's the biggest takeaway is what I've
[SPEAKER_03]: learned is that people really need to stop
looking at this like a static,
[SPEAKER_03]: easy to process, finite thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is a magical, mysterious,
mystical plant medicine and this approach,
[SPEAKER_03]: this copy and paste approach of all your
SOPs from whatever tobacco or alcohol
[SPEAKER_03]: distributor you used to work with or
whatever sales book you were taught 15
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago, whatever book you read,
it doesn't apply here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that what we forget sometimes is
to really listen deeply to your point,
[SPEAKER_03]: listen deeply to where it's going to land
and also be honest about the fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: this is still only going to be able to be
seen in very specific ways maybe on the
[SPEAKER_03]: YouTube channel if YouTube continues
allowing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bans make us have to be really
creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simone talks a lot about humor and
bringing that into it to make things more
[SPEAKER_03]: shareable and we can talk about that too,
but I think that that's the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: prevention for us to normalizing and
removing the stigma is that we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: getting access to mainstream in a way
that's not the same typical messaging of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Snoop Dogs, the Wiz Khalifas,
the Willie Nelsons.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to feel really thoughtful and not
just something that is just putting a
[SPEAKER_03]: square peg into a round hole, we need to
be really, really thoughtful about it and
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's what it's lacking is
there's a lot of eagerness and arrogance
[SPEAKER_03]: without real data behind it, which is what
you specialize in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we try.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mika, so a lot of what you do is on
YouTube, so can you kind of talk about,
[SPEAKER_08]: to Luna's point, some of the challenges
that you have with your work on YouTube
[SPEAKER_08]: and how you sort of try and mitigate those
and overcome them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let me say I have YouTube and
Instagram and it's quite the same,
[SPEAKER_04]: but for me personally, Instagram is a
little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube is more strict when it comes to
cannabis, but I have a restriction on both
[SPEAKER_04]: channels, which is there are two reasons
for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the one hand, we have the restrictions
of YouTube or of Instagram, of the
[SPEAKER_04]: platforms, which are not transparent at
all.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody knows what we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody knows the rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually, it's a kind of lottery if I
upload a video and I always hope it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: being delayed or something like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the other hand, in Germany,
we have a very special situation,
[SPEAKER_04]: which makes the marketing quite difficult
because cannabis is a legal medicine on
[SPEAKER_04]: federal basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's also considered as a legal
narcotic and you're not allowed to
[SPEAKER_04]: advertise for legal narcotics,
not at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do the companies do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we have, meanwhile, nearly 200
strains in the pharmacy and everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: wants to advertise for this strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to book influencers,
but influencers are not allowed to sell
[SPEAKER_04]: advertisements to companies for legal
narcotics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to be tricky.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be tricky when it comes to the
invoice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be tricky when it comes to the
video or to the posting because you're not
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed to advertise, but you're allowed
to mention the medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what they do, they also focus on
patient groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because patient groups are very safe to
advertise with, but it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: advertisement.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not official advertisement.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does not work in the classic way we
used to advertise the last.
[SPEAKER_04]: I come from the magazine business
originally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to write and be chief editor in
several cannabis magazines and that
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't work anymore so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have social media,
it's very hard to do advertisement or to
[SPEAKER_04]: promote a product in the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think this goes to Simone's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember we were talking about education?
[SPEAKER_03]: Simone, you were talking the way around
this is don't be salesy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It shouldn't have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, weed sells itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I say that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said just make it so that it's not,
it's like you're doing it for education
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's undeniable that the purpose and
the intent was to educate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's really the empowerment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the true influencers is I respect
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I see you using something,
I trust that it's good because of your
[SPEAKER_03]: legitimizing, validating, pre vetting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's trust and relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how you've been getting around
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My advice is always don't hashtag
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tag anyone who shadow banned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't smoke on camera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Simone actually really inspired me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, it's not really about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about being really conscious and
building it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know if you want to speak
to it, but I think it's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, thank you very much for those words.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't say that's not true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess the point is that at this,
when we started, we focused on education
[SPEAKER_06]: and it happens that I was, I was a script
writer for a comedy show back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was writing jokes for a living.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm super funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will come.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will come.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, but we realized that it was a very
hostile marketing environment back in the
[SPEAKER_06]: day.
[SPEAKER_06]: We realized that guidelines were not going
to play in our favor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we figured this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: When people laugh, they will share the
content.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a way to hack the algorithm that
will not show you on any feed,
[SPEAKER_06]: basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: All our media is banned already.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm shadow banned.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look for me on Instagram or
anything, we won't appear unless you write
[SPEAKER_06]: the specific username for all of our
platforms.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we still grow every week.
[SPEAKER_06]: We grow a couple thousand followers and
it's like more massive and stronger in
[SPEAKER_06]: different platforms.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is because people are sharing the
content, especially because it's
[SPEAKER_06]: educational.
[SPEAKER_06]: We always try to teach something.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's how to use a vaporizer or a bong,
so be it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will take a big rip and get super high
on camera.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we were showing how to use the bong
and why is this better?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or worse for you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or what should be aware of when using a
bong or a vaporizer?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like straightforward information.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we make it funny by being kind of
honest and genuine to all the feelings
[SPEAKER_06]: that you experience when doing this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's very... I think there's a
really important point about authenticity
[SPEAKER_08]: there that I do want to come back to.
[SPEAKER_08]: But just before we go to that,
maybe just to take a slight step back,
[SPEAKER_08]: because it seems to me, and we do have a
lot of people here who aren't actively
[SPEAKER_08]: engaged, engaged already in marketing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems to me that there's a bit of a
paradox around social media, because on
[SPEAKER_08]: the one hand, you guys are saying it's the
most important element.
[SPEAKER_08]: But on the other, I've seen people say
before, you need to avoid social media,
[SPEAKER_08]: try and drive people to your website,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: So... They're both true though.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know two things can be true at the
same time, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But just how do you balance those things?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I guess more concretely,
if you guys are going to use social media
[SPEAKER_08]: or if people here are going to use social
media, what is the best social media
[SPEAKER_08]: platform for cannabis in your guys'
opinion?
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I don't know who wants to kick
off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Madeline, do you want to have a go at that
one?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, definitely to your point,
the website, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can own it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can update it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can shut it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see how the dwell time,
where they're going from what page to
[SPEAKER_03]: what, how long they're staying there,
what they're slowing down on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really awesome resource.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it just gets them to see your
branding and your voice instead of it
[SPEAKER_03]: being through the LinkedIn filter,
through the Twitter filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, a lot of you guys know,
I think the Whova app is actually pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But LinkedIn really is the only place
that's not banning us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can use hashtags with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can share stories, not worry about being
policed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's people on LinkedIn that are
really in the B2B space.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like that's really relevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find that that's the best place to stay
away from some of the lower vibrational
[SPEAKER_03]: energies.
[SPEAKER_03]: People who really have their stuff
together are on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming to these conferences.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of ways, I think that that's
to your point about doing both.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the consumer brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the acknowledgement on the social
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the legitimacy with other
sophisticated professionals that want to
[SPEAKER_03]: see people that really know what they're
doing and care about making this happen
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's a lot of talk and not much
action.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got to get this going.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we don't do it, it's going to be all
kinds of other folks that are not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for the people who've built it,
let's do it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I compliment those?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like when you acknowledge that your
website, it's going to be a free platform
[SPEAKER_06]: for you to do whatever you want in this
space.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you're navigating these difficult
waters of cannabis social media or
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis in social media, how many of you
guys publish written content in your
[SPEAKER_06]: websites to look for SEO positioning?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of us should be doing that if we
are aware that all our websites should
[SPEAKER_06]: have a blog space.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how many of you are aware of ChatGPT
by this point?
[SPEAKER_06]: And are using it in your, okay,
this is a huge trick for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you prompt ChatGPT for SEO
positioning or SEO enhanced cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: content, this is the way that you can
easily position your website even without
[SPEAKER_06]: showing the actual content.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can go into that SEO ranking
easily now with these tools.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I would recommend is to work on
that blog space in your website using this
[SPEAKER_06]: new AI software or AI, just AI,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, that's a trick that we are now
using and it has helped us a lot,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially e-commerce.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could do a whole other session
developing an AI in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mika, you have to come in there,
I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let me say I'm doing cannabis
content.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I started on YouTube, my first
channel in 2006.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that time, stoner content worked very
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, stoner content does not work at
all for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the one side, we have all these
restrictions on the platforms.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the other side, people want to have
serious information about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want to see this stoner stuff
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, some young people are still
successful with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But people who are really interested in
the industry, people who are interested to
[SPEAKER_04]: be in the legal industry, they don't want
to have this stoner stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want to see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wouldn't say there's a best platform
for my content, but I can tell you the
[SPEAKER_04]: more serious I make my content,
the more research, the more time I invest
[SPEAKER_04]: in my content, the more followers I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best impact is the good content in my
eyes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so there was that point around
authenticity and making sure that whatever
[SPEAKER_08]: you're releasing and whatever channel is
real and speaking to the consumers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Stephen, I know you guys do events and
so on.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you keep it real in terms of what
you're trying to do to get the message
[SPEAKER_08]: out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll approach this from a little bit of a
different angle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of more of a ludite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not very active on social media,
and I'm kind of the front-facing guy at
[SPEAKER_05]: these types of events and more or less
doing a lot of the back-end work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's funny, when I hear educated and
empowered, it's like it's stripped
[SPEAKER_05]: straight from our training manual.
[SPEAKER_05]: I truly think that those two are the two
most powerful words that can be used in
[SPEAKER_05]: almost any industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a quick example.
[SPEAKER_05]: A marketing technique that we do when you
start getting front-facing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, like I said, we opened up the very
first retail store in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did just out of this one store $14.7
million worth of sales in one year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were processing about 650 people a day,
and you bet your ass I was the best
[SPEAKER_05]: salesman there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that I absolutely
love.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you have 600 SKUs and you have
somebody that comes in there, and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: just like wide-eyed and just bushy-tailed
being like, oh my God, there's fucking
[SPEAKER_05]: weed here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry for my language.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really special.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you want to be able to refine 600
different SKUs to something that they
[SPEAKER_05]: actually want and not trying to be all and
end all the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So back to education and empower,
you ask five open-ended questions,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I can drill 600 SKUs down to about
five or six.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're the ones that are making the
decisions, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You are asking them questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a choose-your-own-adventure
book.
[SPEAKER_05]: You end up at the end result based on your
decisions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where you can, in my opinion,
is really the strongest form of eye-to-eye
[SPEAKER_05]: marketing that results in them promoting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your customers become your promoters.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to put my like semi-pretty
face like all over speaking eloquently,
[SPEAKER_05]: doing all of these things to be able to
attract attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: I train people that are able to actually
authentically show the passion that they
[SPEAKER_05]: have, otherwise we don't hire them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously basic competency needs to be
there, yada, yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hiring practices are important,
I assure you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you're able to actually educate
people and empower them to make decisions,
[SPEAKER_05]: it opens up an entire different pathway in
their brain.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the boss, not you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of a sudden they feel empowered,
they feel educated, they feel more
[SPEAKER_05]: knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_05]: They walk out of there with one,
a product that they very likely are going
[SPEAKER_05]: to enjoy more because you helped guide
them down that pathway.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden they're your
influencer.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you looked at how many people were
tagging Hello Cannabis, there were 25
[SPEAKER_05]: stores in Ontario, a province of 14
million people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had people driving literally two hours
passing by four other stores to get to my
[SPEAKER_05]: store.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a fact.
[SPEAKER_05]: People taking a city bus across Hamilton,
which is like 30 kilometers, to get to our
[SPEAKER_05]: store instead of walking distance there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the same products, same products.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is seriously as simple as educating and
empowering, building an actual experience
[SPEAKER_05]: around this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Experiential marketing I think is
absolutely critical.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use social media, but it's really
through our people.
[SPEAKER_05]: At our stores we start running real
events.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did Magic the Gathering.
[SPEAKER_05]: We called it Magic the Godging.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a stupid name, but it's
hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we sold out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had 40 people playing a Magic the
Gathering card tournament.
[SPEAKER_05]: You tried to front fee, and we put it in
the back room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably shouldn't have put this on the...
Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the cat's out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, we did it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Screw you, AGCO.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are simple rules that you can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where you are able to kind of just touch
that line of legality.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll stand in front of a judge and be
like, please explain why having a card
[SPEAKER_05]: tournament here is against the law.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no illegal gambling here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no excessive consumption that's
happening here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are bringing like-minded people
together with a niche market that they
[SPEAKER_05]: actually enjoy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you bet your ass that every single
person that was there was filming,
[SPEAKER_05]: was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You combine 40 people in all of the social
media, tagging.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not us doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not getting shadow ban.
[SPEAKER_05]: You had 40 different people saying,
this is the coolest thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm smoking cannabis, and I'm playing a
Magic the Gathering tournament.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the authenticity piece,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, authentic community, I guess,
is the same, whether it's a digital one or
[SPEAKER_08]: one in the real world.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you do events, networking as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your experience with those,
or how do you go back?
[SPEAKER_03]: For us, it's showing up and doing good
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know that there's a lot of business
to be had, but not forgetting the people
[SPEAKER_03]: of color that have been hit by the war on
drugs, not forgetting the women in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry that are getting pushed
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's International Women's Month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday was International Women's Day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really want to have good campaigns
that center around Black History Month.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, every day we posted on our
story a different black cannabis company
[SPEAKER_03]: that was owned by folks of color to
support.
[SPEAKER_03]: This month, we're doing all kinds of work
to feature women.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our dab rigs goes to donating to
the pollinator project to conserve bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: We work with veterans groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do really flexible financing for small
craft businesses and farmers in California
[SPEAKER_03]: that can't afford to buy hardware,
their cartridges, or their disposables up
[SPEAKER_03]: front.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can help work out flexible terms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this authenticity and this,
to your point, the building of the brand
[SPEAKER_03]: loyalty where everyone becomes an
evangelist, that's been huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I helped start Jetty Extracts,
one of the first cartridge companies in
[SPEAKER_03]: California back in 2014, there was not
really a compassion project like the
[SPEAKER_03]: Shelter Project, which we were giving away
unlimited cannabis to anyone who signed up
[SPEAKER_03]: for a program that was not even fatally
ill, but had severe illness, usually
[SPEAKER_03]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we worked with everyone and we
customized, to your point, it's like what
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly is your goal?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a tincture?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it CBD?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the ratio?
[SPEAKER_03]: And people were, when we went into clubs,
we weren't the cheapest.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't the most well known.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with that story that helped them
understand that their bud tenders had
[SPEAKER_03]: something exciting to tell the clients
when they walked in, this is what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: supporting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You buy one, you give one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing more and you're building love
and health in your life while you're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: it for yourself, for other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that's part of what our
events do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do First Friday.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in Venice, California, near the
beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's an art walk every First Friday.
[SPEAKER_03]: We open up our offices, which looks like a
corporate office, and the whole community
[SPEAKER_03]: can come in and learn about dabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are people who don't have to pay
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just right off the street and they
get to walk by throughout the month and be
[SPEAKER_03]: like, hey, I spire and call up to our
office because we're accessible and we
[SPEAKER_03]: feel real.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are tired of fake storytelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're tired of being marketed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're tired of having their intelligence
insulted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that this authenticity thing is
not only to have longevity in the market,
[SPEAKER_03]: but to actually gain people's trust,
which is, I think, the hardest and most
[SPEAKER_03]: vital thing to actually be successful in
the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_08]: So operating in good faith, I think,
is what I'm hearing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mika, you're someone who straddles the
line between media and marketing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You work as a freelance journalist.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're also working in influencing and so
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a question around authenticity
there, I guess, as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: How important is it that those two things
stay separate?
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you manage the kind of relationship
between marketing, media, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_04]: I told you when we talked before that what
I sometimes miss in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_04]: is the great of professionality we have in
other media because I can do some
[SPEAKER_04]: criticism.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can consider some topic critically.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still, the producer of that product
can advertise in my magazine or on my
[SPEAKER_04]: channel, which there's no contradiction in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I'll miss a little bit,
if you have customers, they expect to
insult you, but they expect to listen to
you.
And so you have to be honest with your
marketing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to be able to influence your
content.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that does not work on the long range
because people are sick of this kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: marketing, what we talked about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you do this unhonest marketing,
if you're not honest with your marketing,
[SPEAKER_04]: you won't be influenced a long time,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: People will not trust you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is very important that in the
cannabis industry, we have the great of
[SPEAKER_04]: professionality, like in other industry,
that you can do critical content,
[SPEAKER_04]: but still have partners from the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are not upset if you write a
critical article about this one strain
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's just not tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can still be a partner of that
company, but this one strain is just not
[SPEAKER_04]: tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they shouldn't try to influence that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have the same problems in the
US.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to work for two platforms.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the US, and I know they were the same
problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always hated that and told the
people, please consider it on a long
[SPEAKER_04]: range.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to build up credibility and
reputation.
[SPEAKER_04]: This doesn't work if you say that we
deserve that taste like hell and makes you
[SPEAKER_04]: helps, but it doesn't take good and the
taste good and doesn't ease your pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sitting beside one of the most
authentic people in cannabis in Europe,
[SPEAKER_05]: and he's right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: No disrespect, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is as authentic as it gets,
from brain all the way to his shell.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that I think is extremely,
extremely important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hiring influencers to promote a product
was a big thing in Canada, and it lasted
[SPEAKER_05]: less than a year, and it was deplorable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so flagrantly obvious and
deplorable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll put that on the record.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_05]: And many of these people are friends of
mine because they're popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry that I interrupt you, but this is
what is just happening in Germany,
[SPEAKER_04]: and this is also why I tell the people you
cannot book train reviews.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot book it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you nailed it completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first ones are just like, oh,
there's a really famous person that we
[SPEAKER_05]: know that's got 100,000 followers and
smokes weed all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or like, please forgive using this term,
but he's like a hot babe.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you just need like a very
strategically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's something we haven't talked
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop using sex to sell weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry if that's just an American problem,
but it is so old and boring.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beyond even offensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we literally just said, there's
booths where it's just like four
[SPEAKER_05]: attractive women that know absolutely
nothing about cannabis, and you've got a
[SPEAKER_05]: conference with the vast majority being
male that are just flooding over there,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm sitting here going like,
what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, yeah, I'm speechless and I'm a guy
that likes speaking.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I use my Latino magnetism to kind of,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, imagine how hard it makes it for
women who actually know their stuff about
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis when that becomes the baseline is
that if you could just hire for the
[SPEAKER_03]: beauty, then people assume that all women
in the space are just hired as models.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do got to give one very, very quick
shout out back to, I'm very against this
[SPEAKER_05]: sex sells in unauthentic marketing for
sure, but I got to give a big shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is an interesting trick that a
colleague of mine that was actually just
[SPEAKER_05]: speaking previously, Alex Ravitch,
who represents Loosh Brands, they have
[SPEAKER_05]: edibles that are penis shaped,
by the way, and he jokingly said,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I said, I got to give you a shout out
for this, sex does sell in many ways,
[SPEAKER_05]: but if you throw cannabis in it,
like just look out, man, and it's quite
[SPEAKER_05]: comical because in Canada, we can't even
have anything that is catered towards
[SPEAKER_05]: children.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you have like a marshmallow that's
like Lucky Charms or something like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: or anything catered to a very subjective
term, which is like excitement,
[SPEAKER_05]: or if you take cannabis, you are going to
feel better, which last I checked,
[SPEAKER_05]: you do anyways.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't market to that, and they were
able to actually get a Health Canada
[SPEAKER_05]: approved medical product that is a penis
shaped edible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see the dimples on my face
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not lying.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bloody hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is absolutely hilarious, and it's used
as medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did this like, I'll let you speak to
him for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody has, I'm talking about it right
now, and people are listening,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in my opinion, this is not using sex
to sell, but this is a basically like,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a little bit of a middle finger to
the marketing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess the problem comes when everyone
starts doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, on that bombshell, we've got about
nine minutes left in the panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to throw it up into the audience
because we want to make sure that you guys
[SPEAKER_08]: have a chance to ask the questions that
you guys want to really hear about.
[SPEAKER_08]: So can we get, who's going to go first?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for Shane and everybody on
the panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you have a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's got a question?
[SPEAKER_03]: And please, when you're thinking about
your question, keep it to one or two
[SPEAKER_03]: sentences and make sure it's, okay,
go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please be brief.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't even hear the whole global
history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before you ask your question, we're all
relatively familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently you have given them all the
information they need.
[SPEAKER_08]: There must be one question at least.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wore my comfortable shoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to walk around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for a very stimulating talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of marketing and social media
platforms, what are your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_01]: Tinder recently announcing that they allow
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: But from what I've read, it's a bit more
complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you tell us about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you saying that it's a selection when
you're in your dating profile to say 420?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Twitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can see where your mind's at,
girl.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll just make it real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just PR.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you actually look at it, they just want
the advertising money, but they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: actually more friendly to cannabis than
they kept up the bands.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just are saying that they're going to
accept money, but they're still going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have to go through the same rigor moral.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was to look good, but if you
look at it, they're not cannabis-friendly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just willing to look at our money,
which is what everyone does.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, they're not trying to be
revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get lost in the headline.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not care about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Chile, we use Grindr.
[SPEAKER_06]: They use a lot of Grindr, but they used to
sell drugs there.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people use my face to sell weed
in Grindr.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just my good face.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were smart.
[SPEAKER_06]: People use my face to travel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we really should be aware of the
fact that we talk about a product,
[SPEAKER_04]: even if it's legal, where an advertisement
ban will be averaged.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most countries legalizing cannabis will
have an advertisement ban.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, maybe some have a total
advertisement ban, and some other
[SPEAKER_04]: countries you may advertise up to a
certain level, but in general,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're talking about a product which will
never be free to be advertised,
[SPEAKER_04]: like Coca-Cola or something like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you should put the cocaine back in
Coca-Cola and then they can advertise it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, my Tinder is on right now,
if anybody's looking for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll swipe right on that, buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm less than a kilometer away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's a question here and a
question there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go here.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, thanks for mentioning about sexism
in the media, because this is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important and I hope everyone understands
very well what we're speaking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, I would like to ask about advice
on how to educate people in terms of media
[SPEAKER_00]: and in all general things, because that's
what's really important now and for the
[SPEAKER_00]: future, because for people that really
doesn't know about THC or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: this, they just judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't smoke, they don't know about
even health part of the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely important for us that works
with media to show up how to educate these
[SPEAKER_00]: people that it's not intro the smokers
group, let's say.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to tackle this if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: With respect to the Educate and
Empowerment, one of the biggest platforms
[SPEAKER_05]: that we started was the Goodbye Opioids
campaign.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an opioid survivor after surgery.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got 17 screws in my feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I have these wonderful socks in
case anybody wants to make fun of me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really truly about education.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You start that at the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm face to face with all these different
doctors.
[SPEAKER_05]: 78 different doctors refer patients to my
clinic.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're able to educate people at the
top, there's a trickle down effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't even need social media for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You gather up all of the data.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're able to get somebody that's able to
speak to the same level of them,
[SPEAKER_05]: to be able to educate and empower them.
[SPEAKER_05]: That trickle down effect happens all the
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens even in my corporation with
respect to educating and empower all of my
[SPEAKER_05]: senior staff.
[SPEAKER_05]: They then educate and empower all of the
managers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those managers then educate and empower
all of the employees.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those employees educate and empower every
single different citizen and patient
[SPEAKER_05]: alike.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about really getting to the top and
being able to educate and empower real
[SPEAKER_05]: influencers, not even outside of social
media.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a plethora of data, both medical
and recreational on different
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids, flavonoids, terpenes,
how they interact with everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to dive into all of this stuff
like eat your heart out, let's go,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's my biggest passion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clinical trials, research reports,
we have literally over 3,000 research
[SPEAKER_05]: reports that we've compiled, both on the
medical basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take that data, you use that to
educate people, you empower them to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to educate other people and so on and
so on and so on.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the challenges though, because we
have access to all this data and all these
[SPEAKER_07]: files and you know it and I know it,
I got an Instagram, you got an Instagram,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can post until you turn blue in the
face.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got 71,000 Instagram followers and if I
post a weed meme, Instagram loves that and
[SPEAKER_07]: I get thousands of likes.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if I post some sort of thing about
real cannabis, here's a picture of some
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis or here's some, this is what
these different terpenes do, they kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: squash that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so how do you reach beyond that is the
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you get around that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the documentary?
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't everyone love watching movies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Get these folks, to me what you're saying
is where people come before, but the app
[SPEAKER_03]: that comes first is the why.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be my answer is get them to
watch giving RSO or CBD to a child having
[SPEAKER_03]: a grand mal seizure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave the bubble.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a story told and pop the bubble,
leave the bubble and pop it that once they
[SPEAKER_03]: see the why, then they're fascinated by
the research.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's documentaries out there,
there's many documentaries like this now
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis or there's beautiful stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it has to start with a story
of people seeing that this is not a joke,
[SPEAKER_03]: this isn't about us wanting to get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a life-saving intervention that
has been grown and cultivated for
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of years by indigenous people
and women.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is our birthright.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't something new.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's crazy to me that people of
color in the United States and all around
[SPEAKER_03]: the world are extra scared of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense that black and brown people
don't want to get involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not mad at the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have an issue with the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want problems with the boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my eyes, it's also very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you make cannabis content, your
orientation is mainstream media.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to reach out, you want to leave
the bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: So look how mainstream media works and use
the same tools like mainstream media.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make serious content.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you leave the bubble.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have experienced that with a few,
not only with a few videos.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can leave the bubble, but you have to
be very, you have to be taking serious and
[SPEAKER_04]: not to be taking what I said before,
taken as the stoner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mainstream, stoner content.
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed there was a lot of B2B people
here and all of this is completely
[SPEAKER_05]: applicable too with this educate and
empower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say Instagram is basically B2C.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're an influencer, it goes directly to
C.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you start looking at B2B,
which is what I was talking about with
[SPEAKER_05]: respect to talking to a doctor,
that's B2B.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they're B2C.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I educate and I empower you to buy into
cannabis and to buy into all of this,
[SPEAKER_05]: you then become the influencer that's B2C.
[SPEAKER_05]: My job is B2B.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm B2B all day long.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this B2C stuff, but ultimately I'm
using B2C to talk to B2B.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: One more question here.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more question and then that's probably
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Michael.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an attorney at Law in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, how does the industry in
the States deal with the fact that the law
[SPEAKER_02]: regulating the advertisement on social
media, how does the industry pushes its
[SPEAKER_02]: interests into, let's say, the legal
texts?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have something here from Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, unless authorized under this act,
it is prohibited to promote cannabis by
[SPEAKER_02]: presenting it or any of its brand elements
in a manner that associates it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vague.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's like they're not even
transparent about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have people that are part-time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're spending money and every day
having a right to Instagram to get
[SPEAKER_03]: unbanned.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing it to tire us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the problem with the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not want us to heal ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's big pharma.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a military industrial complex,
all of these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds conspiratorial, but that's to
Simone's point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it educational.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you see the Nike Swoosh, you don't
see a picture of a sweating person playing
[SPEAKER_03]: basketball.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not saying what they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone goes to HQ, Ache Coup,
it's one of the best clubs in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their sweatshirts just have, if you know,
you know on the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need to overtly market this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually appreciate that we need to
operate a little bit in the shadows
[SPEAKER_03]: because this plant deserves a little
shade.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs a little protection.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't need to be as exposed and as
exploited as a Coca-Cola, to the example.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's smart that we're rolling out
plant medicine in a thoughtful,
[SPEAKER_03]: slow way because it deserves that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want this to be a green rush.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already seen what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green rush sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one wins, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Best thing is the broccoli emoji on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, nobody uses this one for
broccoli anymore because cannabis is
[SPEAKER_04]: totally banter.
[SPEAKER_04]: The emojis and everybody does broccoli.
[SPEAKER_05]: We forgot all about that, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are old.
[SPEAKER_07]: You forgot about the broccoli emoji?
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot about using the broccoli.
[SPEAKER_07]: You won't mention the eggplant.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got claps on that one, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for the panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just about out of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for Shane and Luna and for
Vick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just thanks to everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to the panelists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to take a selfie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone in the audience, real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to take a quick selfie.
[SPEAKER_05]: We love doing this, everybody,
and appreciate you all being here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free to grab us and feel free to
talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone say we.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We love you.
