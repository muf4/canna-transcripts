[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for Peter Homburg Thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you very much for this wonderful and kind
introduction We are leaving this
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific space of this morning,
which was so informative for everybody and
[SPEAKER_01]: now entering the legal space and You said
I'm usually entertaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to do my best after the lunch break
Everybody's a little tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe so we'll see what I can wake you up
a little with what is going to happen in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany as one of those countries within
the European Union which is on the
[SPEAKER_01]: forefront of the legalization of Cannabis
in general and Here's what I would like to
[SPEAKER_01]: do with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some of you know that joke What is
the difference between a speaker from the
[SPEAKER_01]: UK and the US and a German speaker?
[SPEAKER_01]: The diff the difference is that the
speaker from the US and the UK usually
[SPEAKER_01]: starts with a joke the Germans start with
an agenda and here's mine What
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to do is to give you an
overview about the legal status of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis in Germany at this point in time
in particular with respect to where do we
[SPEAKER_01]: stand with medical Cannabis we have a six
years history of using medical Cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany already And where do we stand also
with respect to the legalization of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis for recreational purposes which
is heavily discussed Right now they are
[SPEAKER_01]: already the first steps taken for a
legalization And some setbacks which we
[SPEAKER_01]: have actually experienced in the
constructive talks with the European
[SPEAKER_01]: Commission So let's go and start into the
overview here as you can see the current
[SPEAKER_01]: legal status is that medical Cannabis is
actually allowed since March 2017 With the
[SPEAKER_01]: consequence that physicians can prescribe
Cannabis as a narcotic for the treatment
[SPEAKER_01]: of certain diseases for Patients and we
have heard this morning different
[SPEAKER_01]: indications In Germany, it is not limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no limits with respect to what
does the physician Think about using
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis for the treatment of a certain
disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are no limitations There are of
course to a certain extent recommendations
[SPEAKER_01]: for the physicians for which indications
they could actually use Cannabis of course
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you look into the respective study
of the Bay Farm the majority of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Prescriptions since 2017 are in the field
of pain chronic pain and other pain Up to
[SPEAKER_01]: 70% of the prescriptions and then we have
to follow on a number of different
[SPEAKER_01]: indications and This is kind of
interesting that there is no limitation to
[SPEAKER_01]: that indication list What you should also
know with regard to medical Cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have a public health care system
Which is compulsory though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody actually has to have Health
insurance scheme has to be in paid for of
[SPEAKER_01]: course together with his employer to that
scheme with the consequence That the
[SPEAKER_01]: health insurance system is going to
reimburse patients and also Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: patients the Cannabis patients in
comparison to other patients and that is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a break in the system have to
apply to their respective health insurance
[SPEAKER_01]: for the reimbursement of their of their
prescription of Cannabis products by and
[SPEAKER_01]: do that together with physician and if
they're going to be Reimbursed or if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to be Confirmed that they
are applicable to this scheme They are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be reimbursed for their Indian
for their respective treatment with
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Around 60% of all applications
are approved by the public health
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance companies 40% are rejected for
whatever reasons But you can refile of
[SPEAKER_01]: course together with your with your
physician However, you should also know
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have a great number of Self-payers
meaning they go to the physicians the
[SPEAKER_01]: physicians prescribing the respective
therapy with Cannabis and they go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacy and pay by themselves This they
do not appear in the reimbursement system
[SPEAKER_01]: The other point is of course where do we
stand with recreational Cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently the possession the cultivation
sale transfer etc of Cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational purposes is forbidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's prohibited the violations are very
clearly defined in the respective
[SPEAKER_01]: narcotics act and then other acts with a
possible with the consequences that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually There is no market for
recreational Cannabis at this point in
[SPEAKER_01]: time However, do we have any idea how much
and how the quantities in the illicit
[SPEAKER_01]: market in Germany are currently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, okay, I give you I give you a hint
The medical market is around 20 to 25
[SPEAKER_01]: metric tons per annum in Germany currently
What is the medical market?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the illicit market for Cannabis
for recreational purposes?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is it is around 600 to 700 metric tons
a year so that is and increasing and that
[SPEAKER_01]: has actually caused of course the
government to reconsider whether the
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition Of Cannabis is actually the
right the right thing to do or whether
[SPEAKER_01]: they should do it differently And if we
look into the timeline here You see that
[SPEAKER_01]: the new government relatively new because
it was actually elected in in 2021 decided
[SPEAKER_01]: actually that in their coalition agreement
To legalize the recreational Cannabis two
[SPEAKER_01]: sentences in their coalition agreement
great whatever what happens then actually
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is necessary to say that
there was a consultation process with
[SPEAKER_01]: experts, so how can we do it and
Unfortunately, they did not invite any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of legal help there and legal
consultants because actually the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: framework for the legalization of
recreational Cannabis is relatively narrow
[SPEAKER_01]: You all know the UN conventions from 1961
from 1971 and from 1988 all these UN
[SPEAKER_01]: conventions of which Germany is a member
which they have signed on beyond the
[SPEAKER_01]: conventions prohibit any kind of transfer
any kind of import and any kind of use of
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs in general for recreational purposes
including Cannabis and THC rated products
[SPEAKER_01]: So the German government in October 2022
thought about how can we actually manage
[SPEAKER_01]: this and They came up with the white paper
with a program In which way they would
[SPEAKER_01]: like to legalize recreational Cannabis in
Germany And it was very very detailed so
[SPEAKER_01]: what they wanted to do is they wanted to
have the cultivation domestically done in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany For the recreational market they
wanted to establish a government
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled distribution via license shops
or pharmacies or whatever in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: fulfill the following Needs number one
they wanted to attack the illicit market
[SPEAKER_01]: which was and is still increasing They
wanted to protect the youth from misusing
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis and of course they wanted to
increase the Quality for the consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: because what you can buy on the illicit
market and we all know that is probably
[SPEAKER_01]: not of a quality standard which you Really
would like to have as a consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen a list of what has been
Actually inserted as well into Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: sold on the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to know what all is in
there and frankly speaking these arguments
[SPEAKER_01]: are Valid arguments from my point of view
and have been used in order to create
[SPEAKER_01]: these new legalization of Cannabis in
Germany besides other effects With regard
[SPEAKER_01]: to the enforcement and the enforcement
costs, etc However, this wonderful white
[SPEAKER_01]: paper and the arguments of the government
were presented to the European Commission
[SPEAKER_01]: why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany wanted to go actually in contrast
to the UN conventions and in contrast to
[SPEAKER_01]: the Schengen agreement and the respective
protocols because the Schengen agreement
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the basis for the European Union
and their protocols also include a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent prohibition of recreational use of
of Cannabis of course of drugs but also of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis and the European Commission is
also a member of a party to the UN
[SPEAKER_01]: conventions themselves So what the German
government actually wanted to do back in
[SPEAKER_01]: October November 2022 is to get at least
kind of a confirmation and nodding that
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany can go actually this route by a
government controlled cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: Distribution and of course consumption as
far as possible under in Germany so the
[SPEAKER_01]: constructive talks with the European
Commission led to a clear No, you can't do
[SPEAKER_01]: that Why is that so well the the European
Commission very clearly followed the
[SPEAKER_01]: Schengen agreement and what has been
agreed in the respective protocols and
[SPEAKER_01]: said Germany if you go this route And
that's of course also an indication for
[SPEAKER_01]: other EU member states We will definitely
initiate a respective protocol Proceedings
[SPEAKER_01]: before the European Court of Justice for
breach of the Schengen agreement and in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany had some bad experience in the
past with the European Court of Justice
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, you may recall this decision
against Germany for implementing a toll
[SPEAKER_01]: for private cars on their highways Which
was clearly rejected by the European Court
[SPEAKER_01]: of Justice despite the fact that we had
invested millions already in that system
[SPEAKER_01]: and the other one was for the collection
of data and storing data personal data
[SPEAKER_01]: over a longer period of time that was just
recently and The German government didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to have another proceeding before the
European Court of Justice though the
[SPEAKER_01]: thought about Plan B Plan B came out in
April this year and Everybody was
[SPEAKER_01]: surprised Because if you look into the
industry and what we expect At all was a
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a plan B, which was following more
or less within the borders of the Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: of the UN conventions and the respective
Schengen agreement and but now the German
[SPEAKER_01]: government came up with this wonderful
idea I will elaborate in a minute that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have a two-pillar Two-pillar program for
the legalization of cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational purposes and in April 2023
Karl Lauterbach and Cem Özdemir,
[SPEAKER_01]: the two ministers presented this second
key point paper with this new plan and I
[SPEAKER_01]: will enlighten you on that in a minute How
are we going to legalize cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: In July so not too far back actually the
German government then presented for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time a draft law on that so how does
this two-pillar program look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first pillar is the legalization of
individual cultivation so every adult in
[SPEAKER_01]: every household can actually Cultivate
three female plants at home and can you
[SPEAKER_01]: use the flowers for their own consumption?
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly there is this concept of
community of joint I would say joint self
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivation with I would call it cannabis
clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better to say Cannabis cultivation
associations because that is what it is
[SPEAKER_01]: And I come back in more detail and what
these kind of ecolic cannabis clubs for
[SPEAKER_01]: these Definition today.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can these cannabis clubs do?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are they created?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many members can they have?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can they actually cultivate?
[SPEAKER_01]: and I will enlighten you on that in a
minute the second pillar which was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually not only my favorite solution but
the solution which the industry would have
[SPEAKER_01]: preferred is a regionally limited
scientifically monitored model project
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that is within the boundaries of the
UN Convention because if you look into the
[SPEAKER_01]: UN Convention Cannabis can be used of
course under government control for
[SPEAKER_01]: medical and scientific purposes So that is
exactly what Switzerland is doing right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have respective projects already
established in two major cities where
[SPEAKER_01]: registered Consumers can use and can get
cannabis for recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is under scientific control in order
to collect data Because that is necessary
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to convince even in the long run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say in four years from now even the
European Commission and the European
[SPEAKER_01]: member states that the respective
legalization may have a not negative but
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even a positive impact for example
by decreasing the illicit market The
[SPEAKER_01]: duration for that is five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first pillar is now already Drafted
the respective law is drafted and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: was published not too long ago on August
16 This law actually and I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: bother you with too many of these articles
here, but this law actually Defines and
[SPEAKER_01]: stipulates in which way Cannabis can be
consumed and there are some details in
[SPEAKER_01]: that law which I will show you in a minute
Which are to a certain extent at least
[SPEAKER_01]: questionable In order to go through that a
little bit more in detail, let me just
[SPEAKER_01]: jump to the next slide So here we are
again with the three plans and of course
[SPEAKER_01]: the obligation to prevent access By
miners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that is I think self-understood How
you do that and how you control that is of
[SPEAKER_01]: course not laid out in this wonderful
draft law Because you know if we have
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say 80 million people and we have
consumers I would say around at least say
[SPEAKER_01]: four to four to six million For cannabis
if they start growing at home Do you sense
[SPEAKER_01]: police to their home and ask how many
plants they have there and how many people
[SPEAKER_01]: are living in the household?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know whether this is workable or
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my doubts on that I believe it's
not really controllable however,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you look into the Cannabis clubs on the
on the right side.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can have up to 500 members It's a
non-profit organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very clearly stated in the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for non-profit, which means that
each member has to pay an entrance fee
[SPEAKER_01]: probably and membership fee and is going
to finance actually then the cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cannabis by that cannabis club
because this cannabis Cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: Association is allowed to cultivate
cannabis for its members Up to 500 per
[SPEAKER_01]: club one person can only be a member of
one club not of two clubs so now you start
[SPEAKER_01]: looking into where can we position those
clubs for example in Berlin the capital
[SPEAKER_01]: city, so there are very clear Measurements
that you have to stay away from schools.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to stay away from sport arenas
and so On and old age homes which is
[SPEAKER_01]: understandable Let's but there is not much
space left in Berlin to find Cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: despite the fact that it's really
expensive to find a lot In the city itself
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to do the cultivation Furthermore
the the quality standards are not yet
[SPEAKER_01]: defined is it GACP or even GMP which I
don't believe will be the case but the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality standards are are not Yet defined
for the cultivation and this is also left
[SPEAKER_01]: open for the time being and it's left to
the states To really do the respective
[SPEAKER_01]: qualification and of course granting the
respective licenses for that for these
[SPEAKER_01]: clubs Can you imagine the first members
assembly of let's say 500 members
[SPEAKER_01]: discussing what kind of cultivars the club
should Cultivate It can be a very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting discussion to be very frank So
and here comes here comes the next thing
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumers the the who are allowed to
actually Grow three plants at home have to
[SPEAKER_01]: get their seeds from those cannabis
associations Even if they are not a member
[SPEAKER_01]: they should find a member and ask for a
limited number of seeds to be used for
[SPEAKER_01]: their at-home cultivation and Another
interesting point is that those those
[SPEAKER_01]: members of a cannabis club who are in the
age of 18 to 21 can get 30 grams per month
[SPEAKER_01]: But only with a THC content of up to 10%
Or do you control that Well, it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled of course by self-control,
you know, the cannabis clubs is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a register where the members are
coming in a date of birth and then they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to register and Really look who has
received which cannabis flower with which
[SPEAKER_01]: content Frankly speaking again here
control is an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have a new then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Administration looking into not only
granting the licenses to the respective
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis clubs plus Looking into whether
they are cultivating under the respective
[SPEAKER_01]: quality Measurements and then of course
only handing over these cannabis to their
[SPEAKER_01]: members in a limited quantity 50 gram for
the other adults per month 25 grams per
[SPEAKER_01]: visit Now frankly speaking, this is
difficult to control These are the I would
[SPEAKER_01]: say parts of that law Which are I would
say discussable at least what is I think a
[SPEAKER_01]: good step forward is Which you can see
here in the lower part is a
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalization Cannabis and THC will be
taken out of the German narcotics act It
[SPEAKER_01]: will actually be implemented in the new
Cannabis Act with the consequence that the
[SPEAKER_01]: punishments for respective Offenses are
first reduced because Everybody can now
[SPEAKER_01]: carry 25 grams of cannabis without being
punished But also the respective trade
[SPEAKER_01]: which is forbidden of course will be
implemented in this new Cannabis Act and
[SPEAKER_01]: if you look into the Draft law in article
2 to 7 actually the removal of Cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually from my point of view and we see
us although in the medical market I look
[SPEAKER_01]: into the impact right now in a Minute
positively and I think it's a good step
[SPEAKER_01]: forward So if we go into the impact of
this Cannabis Act on the medical industry
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think it has its positive effects for
the medicinal cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may say well all those patients May
then go rather to The Cannabis Club or
[SPEAKER_01]: start home growing Well, the point is,
you know if you're going to be reimbursed
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway As a patient, why should you do
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's number one number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know exactly what you get if you go to
The medical market, you know exactly what
[SPEAKER_01]: is the content?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the product who has produced it
and you have a much better quality control
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Self-Payers even today would go to
the respective Cannabis clubs or to start
[SPEAKER_01]: home growing I would say is questionable
the prescription Would be valid for a
[SPEAKER_01]: longer period of time because it's not
anymore Narcotic the psychological barrier
[SPEAKER_01]: of physicians prescribing a narcotic is
going to be removed It is now an RX
[SPEAKER_01]: product which has also the positive effect
that it is can be probably used as an
[SPEAKER_01]: e-prescription which is important for the
for the respective IT market and these
[SPEAKER_01]: respective Prescriptions can be Issued by
other EU member states and are and the
[SPEAKER_01]: countries and Switzerland So coming to the
end a brief evaluation of the of the law
[SPEAKER_01]: here actually As I said it is to a certain
extent Difficult to control of this first
[SPEAKER_01]: part and everybody expected that the
second part would be implemented Which is
[SPEAKER_01]: the scientific control pilot project?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which the German government decides
differently it is a draft law It has been
[SPEAKER_01]: gunned through the cabinet which means
Chancellor and the ministers approved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes no to the Parliament and if we
look into the respective Provisions which
[SPEAKER_01]: are important and I mentioned that before
these are the UN conventions and whether
[SPEAKER_01]: we will get a visit from the INCB,
which is the International Narcotic
[SPEAKER_01]: Control Board, which is the police of the
UN conventions Is questionable because you
[SPEAKER_01]: know home grow and cannabis clubs may not
really be actually in line with the UN
[SPEAKER_01]: conventions But what is going to happen
Canada after the legalization of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: has received some warning letters from the
INCB so far the EU law may also be at
[SPEAKER_01]: least a Little hurdle here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they have talked to the EU European
Commission and they have to a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: extent Said you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they nodded and say let's do this
But we don't know that and I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's see you how this will work out So
what is going to happen here is the
[SPEAKER_01]: implementation the cannabis Gazette's as
we call it has already been approved by
[SPEAKER_01]: the Federal Cabinet as I said It is now
going to the Parliament There's a question
[SPEAKER_01]: whether this law has to be approved by the
second chamber, which is the Bundesrat in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany the government Is not of the
opinion they think think that with the
[SPEAKER_01]: respective majority of the Parliament of
the Green Party the liberals and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Social Democrats they can actually put
that new law Which the first is a first
[SPEAKER_01]: pillar in place the second pillar and the
respective draft law will probably come
[SPEAKER_01]: out in October We'll see whether the
discussion how the discussion will go on
[SPEAKER_01]: here This first law the first pillar has
received significant criticism and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have heard already for me that they're Our
arguments which you can actually use
[SPEAKER_01]: against that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look into that time frame I do
not expect implementation of that
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization of cannabis in the first
pillar before I would say mid 2024 if we
[SPEAKER_01]: are lucky from my point of view Alright,
so I hope I haven't bored you to death
[SPEAKER_01]: with that wonderful development here but
it's I think important to see because we
[SPEAKER_01]: are the country in Europe who has actually
made some significant efforts in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize it which is good There's no doubt
about that whether the measurements which
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to taken right now is I would
say The best way to do it and the
[SPEAKER_01]: blueprint I have my doubts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to get on to the next panel,
but thank you so much And I'm sure you can
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to him in the hallway or at the party
tonight You'll be at the party right Peter
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the best-known partiers in all of
Germany You can't tell to look at There's
no more knowledgeable attorney in the
whole country of Germany so thank you
Peter again You
