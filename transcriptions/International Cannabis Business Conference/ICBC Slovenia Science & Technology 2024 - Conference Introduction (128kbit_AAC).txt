[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all right, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all right, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, how's everyone feeling today?
[SPEAKER_00]: All feeling good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let me ask again.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are y'all feeling?
[SPEAKER_00]: You feeling good today, everybody?
Hey!
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring a little enthusiasm here to Lake
Bled.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our second annual ICBC Bled in
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Alex Rogers.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Slovenia is a little bigger than last
year, but I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, but I'm still learning a little
bit of Slovenian now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it more now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to play a little now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this, look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful honor to live in
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful honor to drink wine from
Gris Geberdo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful honor just to be here in
general in your wonderful, clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: safe, sympatish country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anyone needs translation devices,
they're outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the program today will be in
English.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, as we well know, Slovenians are
super smart, and pretty much everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: speaks perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody speaks perfect English.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to thank everybody for
coming to this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Alex Rogers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the owner of the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am very fortunate to live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have helped with cannabis policy for 30
years, starting in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: then to Oregon, and then to Germany,
and now to Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite place, not in the world,
but in the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just have to keep pinching me,
because every time I wake up, and I see
[SPEAKER_00]: the mountains, and I smell this fresh air,
and I eat this Dobro Hrana, I really think
[SPEAKER_00]: that this is a dream here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our advantage in Slovenia is that
we're small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people would say that's a
disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell you right now, the fact that
Slovenia is small, it makes it nimble and
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not as bureaucratic as some other
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you've been to the Aprilana Anota
lately, maybe you disagree with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the truth of the matter is we create
our world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're doing with cannabis
policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Slovenia, there's a lot of exciting
things to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're here to change the world for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it really, ultimately,
when you legalize cannabis, or you
[SPEAKER_00]: modernize cannabis policy, this is a
compassionate thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to do with civil liberties and
civil rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, no medicinal plant should be
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some reason, cannabis has been
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know why cannabis was made illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general consensus is because of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it went against the narrative of
the petrochemical industrial complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is back in the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people know the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now's the time for Slovenia to
modernize their cannabis policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will tell you, ladies and gentlemen,
today, we have an amazing lineup of
[SPEAKER_00]: speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are actually going to probably and
likely learn a few things today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's important is we take this
energy and this momentum from events like
[SPEAKER_00]: this in today's conference, and we push
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean is don't be afraid to
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid to speak your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've awoken the sleeper cells now
in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are ready to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank God for Germany of what they
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now we don't have to say we did
anything different than our big brother
[SPEAKER_00]: from the north, Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Peter, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate our German brethren that are
here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say, once again,
thank you for everybody for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before our first amazing speaker,
I'd like to introduce our emcee,
[SPEAKER_00]: the emcee of the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You love him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, ladies and gentlemen, give a nice
Slovensko round of applause for Unga
[SPEAKER_00]: Jovilo!
[SPEAKER_00]: Dobro jutro!
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that and Krimschnita.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my two Slovenian words.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll get me almost anywhere in Lake
Bled.
