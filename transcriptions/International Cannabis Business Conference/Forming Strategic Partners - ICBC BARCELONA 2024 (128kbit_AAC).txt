[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing good.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's three o'clock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's been here all day?
[SPEAKER_07]: Raise your hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're fucking jeez.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who just got here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you were out all last night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm David Downs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a senior editor at Leafly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for being here for the ICBC panel
on forming strategic partnerships.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go ahead and let our
panelists introduce themselves real fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take it away, Desiree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Desiree, and I'm an intuitive
and behavioral trans person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a personal psychoanalyst.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also a published author on the
cross-cultural study of depression,
[SPEAKER_04]: the universality of it, and its
medicalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am also the vice president and director
of the Human Resources, with a
[SPEAKER_04]: transformative wellness retreat and a
distributorship company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is Healthy Self, and what we have
there are all ancient healing plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're wearing a lot of hats out of San
Diego, Desiree.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do, plenty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sonny, take it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Sonny Moerenaert, one of the partners
at Cultivators from the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're active in grown consultancy and
cultivation, cannabis research,
[SPEAKER_03]: and education.
[SPEAKER_02]: George, hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: George Tantsev, CEO of Comerq.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comerq is a European-based company.
[SPEAKER_02]: For 25 years into the fragrance and
flavor, the last 10 years into cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: developed proprietary technology under the
trademark of Pure 5, for extraction of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis at ambient conditions,
full terpene profile, and preserving all
[SPEAKER_02]: vitalities of the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Comerq's in like 40, 50 states in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: and going hard in Europe this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nathan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Nathan Kroeger, I'm with RAD
Source Technologies.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are a medical device company that has,
as of about eight years ago, expanded into
[SPEAKER_05]: the cannabis industry, and our equipment
is used to sanitize cannabis flower
[SPEAKER_05]: primarily, so that people can pass
microbial testing and reduce risk for
[SPEAKER_05]: people who have compromised immune
systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really diverse set of panelists,
but I think one thing that we can all
[SPEAKER_07]: relate to is the idea of forming
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted you to raise your hands if you've
ever been in a bad partnership in business
[SPEAKER_07]: or in your personal life in your life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Reflect on those for a moment right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone cackles.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember doing events with the team on
one project, and you're like, gosh,
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe I got into this boat.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to get to the other side of the
lake so I can get out of this boat as soon
[SPEAKER_07]: as I can.
[SPEAKER_07]: To start about strategic partnerships,
Sunny Cultivators is working as a project
[SPEAKER_07]: manager on 12 different companies that
I've worked with in the past, and they've
[SPEAKER_07]: done a lot of research on different parts
of growing as part of the World Horta
[SPEAKER_07]: Center.
[SPEAKER_07]: How did that partnership come together?
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a need for research in
cultivation, and together it makes it more
[SPEAKER_03]: affordable for everybody, so they asked us
to help them setting it up and bringing
[SPEAKER_03]: companies together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it just a lot of meetings?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you have to meet people and befriend
them and win them to your side?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course that is part of it,
but it's really like all have the goal in
[SPEAKER_03]: creating new knowledge and sharing that
knowledge, so we are still in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a young industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all need to learn a lot still and
making it more professional.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the key things is genetics,
so one of the partners is an F1 SeaTec,
[SPEAKER_03]: is a breeder with F1 hybrid seeds,
which is completely new.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be a game changer, so we want
to be upfront with that and knowing what
[SPEAKER_03]: is happening in that field.
[SPEAKER_07]: Desiree, you've been doing indigenous
partnerships, strategic alliances in South
[SPEAKER_07]: America.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you take us inside some of those
experiences and talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_07]: how forming partnerships with indigenous
communities has been different than at a
[SPEAKER_07]: broader level with Western worlds or with
countries?
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, being the president of and
co-founder of the Foundation for Human
[SPEAKER_04]: Kindness and Compassion, which is the
non-profit company or organization that we
[SPEAKER_04]: have alliance and we're forming strategic
alliance with these indigenous
[SPEAKER_04]: communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the main problem with that one is
because each country, they have their own
[SPEAKER_04]: laws, but the indigenous people also have
their own laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, one of our experiences is what
we had with Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the community there were in...
Yeah, shout out Columbia, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Lucky is agreeing with me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of the laws that they have,
which is so different from whatever the
[SPEAKER_04]: Fed, I'd call it Federal Columbia one,
it took our proposals at least three
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within that, it's still like fighting
within the community.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're really having a hard time putting
that together, but at least in some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: other indigenous communities that we have,
like in Peru and in Mexico and Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least with that one, we don't... It's
going slow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really very slow because of that
reason, but it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you just Google Columbia?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, we had one big meeting and our
proposal when we did our first proposal
[SPEAKER_04]: with the NASA community of Cauca that's in
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, there's two indigenous community
that we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have in Columbia, one is the Koji
community for the Taronga and the Sierra
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevada.
[SPEAKER_04]: The three years one is the one that's
happening with the Cauca one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go in there, everyone, the leader,
the women, the leader of the women are
[SPEAKER_04]: there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I also wanted to go and start
mental health on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because every time all of these strategic
alliances that we have with each
[SPEAKER_04]: indigenous communities, we really want to
attend to their health.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only just the health, but we want to
develop all the businesses that they have
[SPEAKER_04]: that is fit within that community.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been working on this new
understanding of cannabis, trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: change mindsets around the healthfulness
of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do these communities see it that way or
are you reorienting them?
[SPEAKER_07]: I imagine a lot of Colombian communities
have been really impacted by the war on
drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is one of a really good thing that
you brought up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because not only Columbia, but Peru,
Mexico, and even the Jamaican with the
[SPEAKER_04]: Rastafari in there, because we're also
involved with some of the Rastafari
[SPEAKER_04]: communities they use cannabis,
they grow cannabis, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They understand the spiritual side of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want people to understand,
whether we use it medicinal or
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to understand, we have to be in
relation and vibrating together with the
[SPEAKER_04]: consciousness of that plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do understand that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is something that we want to really
bring and change the mindset of each and
[SPEAKER_04]: every one.
[SPEAKER_07]: George, over in Germany, we're seeing
decriminalization and the beginning of
[SPEAKER_07]: further medical legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you looking at Germany?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you looking for new partnerships in
Germany?
[SPEAKER_07]: How is your approach to this year and next
year going to go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, everybody is looking at the new
legislation in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, the decriminalized flower,
we expect by the end of the year,
[SPEAKER_02]: to allow extraction that will bring a lot
of business into Germany, because
[SPEAKER_02]: currently all the products that come in
Germany are either extracted in
[SPEAKER_02]: Switzerland or around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, this is going to be the
cracking point of the entire Europe,
[SPEAKER_02]: because everybody is looking after Germany
and France as the major leaders of the EU.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is essential to see that change.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you need on the team?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you need anything to expand in Germany?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if we talk about partnerships,
of course, you first look at the holes of
[SPEAKER_02]: your organization and try to fill them
with the resources that you don't have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, partnerships are formed like if
you read the books for partnerships,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what it says.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, what partnership helps is to
save money from tax and from investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the major things of building
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, we're going to be partnering with
companies in Europe to provide systems to
[SPEAKER_02]: start extracting, to start processing the
best way possible, and that's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: mutual effort, of course, to minimize the
expense.
[SPEAKER_07]: What types of partnerships are you looking
at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there are different partnerships.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say marketing partnerships.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marketing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better to find a marketing partner in
Germany to be able to get to a German
[SPEAKER_02]: audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a supply chain partnership.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, as an extractor manufacturer,
we have a pretty sophisticated process for
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturing systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at a lot of sourcing
components.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be looking for companies to
install in Germany, which is an
[SPEAKER_02]: installation partnership.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be looking eventually
also at financial partnerships,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to finance the system for the local
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a lot of things that we're
going to be looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of things that can help setting up a
vertical integration, which I see in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe is very typical to outsource your
niche that you're not too competent to
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody else to help you with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Raise your hand if you're looking for a
partner today.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we've got a couple.
[SPEAKER_07]: Save your questions for the end,
huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: How have you gone about building some of
your more fruitful partnerships over the
[SPEAKER_07]: years when you think back on the ones that
have worked?
[SPEAKER_07]: How did they come together?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the learnings there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you are successful with your
first partnership, that means that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: either lucky or destined to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 90% set to failure, your first
partnership.
[SPEAKER_02]: 90%?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: God damn, okay, good.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why that didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the thing that doesn't tell you is
you have to figure out the people you
[SPEAKER_02]: partner with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to figure out the people you partner
with, like usually the books say,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, first you need to see what you need
to source.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, you need to find a partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Third, you write a contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fourth, follow the contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless your partner is a person that can
keep parts of it, is dedicated,
[SPEAKER_02]: is passionate, then there's no contract
that can save you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like temperament.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like ethics.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't show up in a fucking RFP.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to go and see how they treat the
waiter.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a marriage.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's worse than a marriage.
[SPEAKER_07]: You spend way more time talking to this
person.
[SPEAKER_07]: With a contract.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're chuckling over there, Nathan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you experienced this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, as I mentioned, we're a medical
device manufacturer, so we have equipment
[SPEAKER_05]: all over the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally have been in Mongolia,
China, installing equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you have a good partner,
things go well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you don't, you show up and they
don't have the equipment there or they
[SPEAKER_05]: want you to pay them under the tables.
[SPEAKER_05]: They get, you know, get certain things
done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that makes life really miserable.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I like the idea that George
says about luck, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: just having to get on the ground and go
talk to some of those people is the only
[SPEAKER_05]: way to get it done sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys, I've never done one yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go hang out with the person you're
going to do it with for a while and you're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to know really fast whether it's
going to be like a fit.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like Desiree, you're chuckling,
but I mean, you have like a psychology
[SPEAKER_07]: background.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you drill down into this a little bit?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like there's this phrase that
personnel is policy, but the people are
[SPEAKER_07]: the personnel.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the people end up being the policy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but can you build on what they're
saying?
[SPEAKER_04]: In what sense?
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you suss out whether someone's a
good partner like as a person?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well... What are the red flags?
[SPEAKER_04]: You should... Well, red flags is... How do
I say that?
[SPEAKER_04]: With a partner as being... See,
it's the same with being in a
[SPEAKER_04]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like because it's really true that
being in a business is like being in a
[SPEAKER_04]: marriage, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like the same as if you're the
president or anything, you treat the
[SPEAKER_04]: country as a business as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a business sense itself,
if two people, let's say the relationship,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that is the most important thing in
any part, whether you're in business,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether you're in relationship,
if you know that there are two... You
[SPEAKER_04]: don't really agree on some things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then, and if the other one really cannot
accept, it's more of the acceptance of
[SPEAKER_04]: what each other's got.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, versus the like... Versus of go...
Rock, unmovable... You know, I don't like
[SPEAKER_04]: what you're saying and I'll fight.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be... You've got to have more of
an open mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it depends on what sort of course of
business that you've got and the person
[SPEAKER_04]: that you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because most of the people don't want to
go and get new information, even though
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, okay, this is my belief.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there's new information that I have
received.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, people should be able to go and
adjust that or adopt it to whatever they
[SPEAKER_04]: already believe so that at least... It's a
different way.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least you're opening your mind a little
bit to what the other person is saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of being really closed because,
hey, this is my belief.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sticking with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't believe whatever you say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is how we're going to go do
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how we're going to put where our
money is and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, do they have a goal orientation?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they about solving a problem?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do you have two members on the team
that are an unstoppable force,
[SPEAKER_07]: meaning an immovable object?
[SPEAKER_07]: You ever been on the seams with those two
people?
[SPEAKER_07]: One guy's just bashing, the other guy's
never laying up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the phrase that came to mind is like,
styles make fights.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could have two really effective
people, but if they have different styles
[SPEAKER_07]: of operating, then they're going to
conflict and the... Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just to add to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a group that we were working with
in Brazil that I was working with and we
[SPEAKER_05]: were getting along fairly well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we had a new person came in and
they had a very different style.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wasn't very long after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a different partnership with the
people in Brazil just because those are
[SPEAKER_05]: the people that got along with the guy
that we were working with that we sent
[SPEAKER_05]: down there to set that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, to your point, I think a big part of
it isn't just similar goals, but also has
[SPEAKER_05]: to be similar personalities.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one thing I would add is like,
and maybe you guys can talk about this,
[SPEAKER_07]: like, is there a way to go slow with
partnerships?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you break off a little bit and do a
little bit together and then build so it's
[SPEAKER_07]: not like getting married on the first
date?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can anybody talk about being more
iterative with forming strategic
[SPEAKER_07]: partnerships?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you guys ever gone slow or you
guys just paper it up?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about financing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have 20 million, you can do
everything vertical, but if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: 200,000, you got to find somebody to fill
the holes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are the main differences in
partnerships structures in the US versus
[SPEAKER_07]: the EU?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started first in the EU.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started with cannabis in 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: We tried to do it ourselves by doing the
way in the US, like we acquired a farm
[SPEAKER_02]: company because we didn't work with this
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started to work with farming,
then extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot design an extraction system
unless you work with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we spent a lot in that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was beneficial at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I saw was a difference between
the markets that in US, everybody wants to
[SPEAKER_02]: be vertical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually, probably because it's much
easier to get to a hard amount of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they buy the building, they start to
grow, then they think about extraction,
[SPEAKER_02]: then they think how to make products,
then they start marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this under one roof, probably the best
way to have most margins.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it's about if you don't have
the funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Europe, I noticed that companies are
specialized in making products,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they source their material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a partner that they source the
materials from, and they're more than one,
[SPEAKER_02]: like packaging, actives, and base
ingredients and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're sales partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go to sales networks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a partnership.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Europe, it's more open to do their
little niches and getting partnerships.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of the first way to look
into a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, who do I work with to achieve
that structure?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sunny, you're nodding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you seeing this type of heterogeneity,
horizontal integration, less vertical in
[SPEAKER_07]: Europe?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you build on what George is saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: With vertical integration, you mean really
going together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Working in Europe, it sounds like
everyone's got a piece.
[SPEAKER_07]: No one can do one whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we are, in Europe, more used to
really working together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Together with different companies than in
America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Together, you know more than alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is also why the horticulture
industry in the Netherlands got so big,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you can also learn from your
neighbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your competitor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But together, you know more than alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that way, we are still number one,
if you talk about growing in greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_03]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's also in the cannabis sometimes
a bit frustrating, because everybody is so
[SPEAKER_03]: closed and don't want to say anything how
they are doing, what they are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm true believer that if you talk
with each other, you get to know more
[SPEAKER_03]: details.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can get a better product in the
end.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: How does a partnership look on paper?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the standard type of agreement?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any standard type of agreement,
George?
[SPEAKER_02]: I already mentioned that whatever you put
on paper may not have the power to protect
[SPEAKER_02]: you at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your partners are not honest and not
right people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But usually, you've got to first define,
like, I never do three-way agreements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would never do a three-way agreement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always needs to be a two-partner
agreement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have to clearly define
responsibility of the first party,
[SPEAKER_02]: responsibility of the second party,
confidentiality terms, because if it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: confidential, it's not a real partnership.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your partner needs to care about your
success, your confidentiality,
[SPEAKER_02]: your passion needs to improve himself
continuously as you do improve yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you try to capture these things into
the agreement, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least outline in the agreement as many
things as you can so both parties are at
[SPEAKER_02]: least aware what page they are on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to see how it goes
through the signing process, because when
[SPEAKER_02]: it goes to attorneys, this is the point
where then a lot of things break.
[SPEAKER_02]: As partners, you can see if a partner is
committed at that point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, these all sound like things they
tell you in relationship advice,
[SPEAKER_07]: like define responsibilities, like have
confidentiality, like commit to
[SPEAKER_07]: self-improvement.
[SPEAKER_07]: One member of the team can't be like
learning on Duolingo and the other one
[SPEAKER_07]: just playing video games all night and
day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you don't really know what you
got, until you get in a pickle together
[SPEAKER_07]: and you have to get out together or you
see what people are made of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, Desiree?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_04]: Agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I concur.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a good relationship consultant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sunny, the World Horta Center is putting
out knowledge in the form of articles.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are some recent articles that you
guys have the fruits of the partnership so
[SPEAKER_07]: far, and then what do you want to do next?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what we're bringing out is new
knowledge which we got it through
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation research and new things which
will be coming up is new strategies in
[SPEAKER_03]: growing how you can influence the final
content.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how can you influence cheminoid levels,
terpene levels in the final product?
[SPEAKER_07]: What type of strategies?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you had mentioned earlier that you
just published some papers on screening.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's three types of screens now,
blocking solar energy, saving energy,
[SPEAKER_07]: improving heat energy, and then blocking
out light entirely for light debt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are certain examples where you can
look at how can you in that way influence
[SPEAKER_03]: the final ingredients in the dry flower in
the end, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you can also play with
irrigation fertilizers and seeing how you
[SPEAKER_03]: can affect plant growth and development
and the content of the final flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can anyone talk about the law side of it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there something you shouldn't do if
you're an American coming over here and
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to do a handshake deal to start a
partnership?
[SPEAKER_07]: George, have you ever run into like what's
the legal things to sort of think about?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you just do a contract like you do in
the United States and like give someone
[SPEAKER_07]: percentage of the company or those kind of
arrangements?
[SPEAKER_07]: How are the EU and the US different that
way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've done anything between a single
page to 10 page agreements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends on the urgency, depends on the
commitment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, disagreements are not to give
percentages from the company, but to
[SPEAKER_02]: define forms for JV that two companies
have equal responsibilities in this
[SPEAKER_02]: project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that even a single page
agreement can be powerful enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: protect both sides unless everything needs
to be listed inside and everyone needs to
[SPEAKER_02]: be on the same page what they have to do
in order to commit and fulfill.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to add to that, one of the things I've
found is that people in general are good
[SPEAKER_05]: people, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody wants best for their neighbor
relatively in my experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we found is that contracts that
are a little more in detail that reduce
[SPEAKER_05]: potential ambiguity increase the
likelihood that you're going to both be
[SPEAKER_05]: happy with the outcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that reminds me when the Catholic
priest pulls the young couple together,
[SPEAKER_07]: you really want to get married and they
like start ironing it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: They make you do a consulting where you're
like you guys are going on the same page,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Before you because like let's make sure
we're going to agree to split the money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Goals go in the same checking account like
all the little details.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you don't have the details and
you go into it, you both might be going
[SPEAKER_05]: into a relationship, a partnership with
different expectations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when those don't happen or when
something unexpected happens, if you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: have a way to handle it, both parties
could be very unhappy and you could find
[SPEAKER_05]: yourself in a legal court trying to figure
things out, which is not good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, we're going to close here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to take some questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted you guys to go down the line and
tell me what partners you're looking for
[SPEAKER_07]: next.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're looking for financing partners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the biggest prohibitor for us to expand
into Europe, technology works,
[SPEAKER_05]: industry is acceptance of it, but it's
finance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our equipment is not inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if we're looking for people who are
willing to take on the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_05]: to finance it, it took us a while to find
partners in the United States and they
[SPEAKER_05]: helped us grow significantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we're looking for in Europe
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: George, next partnership.
[SPEAKER_02]: My challenge all these years in the
cannabis industry has been education.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that when a product of ours gets in
the hand of customer, we win always.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem for me, so the partner that
I'll be looking for is going to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: distinct distribution partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Distribution partner that can talk the
right language, that can have the right
[SPEAKER_02]: access to the customer base.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to distribute the product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like that might be like CBD extracts,
cannabis extracts.
[SPEAKER_07]: We manufacture machines, technology.
[SPEAKER_07]: The tech.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sunny, next partnership.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we're just finalizing it and a
partner where we can do together practical
[SPEAKER_03]: trainings on cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Practical?
[SPEAKER_03]: Training.
[SPEAKER_03]: Training, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really doing the cloning, the growing,
but also post harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just finalizing it and the website
should be soon live that we really promote
[SPEAKER_03]: that, that LPs can send their stuff to us
in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can be trained for a week or two
weeks so that they are ready when they
[SPEAKER_03]: start up their own facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where in the Netherlands do we get to
learn in Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: The South.
[SPEAKER_07]: Desiree, next partnership you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the communities and the families
that we are involved with are mostly in
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're in the growing and of course
all other ancillary services like the
[SPEAKER_04]: clothing, handicraft, biochemical,
bio plastics, bio constructions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the most important thing is these
people are the custodians.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the traditional medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they wanted to do is to also
share it with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that sense, that's where we need
economic support because we want to
[SPEAKER_04]: manifest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want, we want them to manifest their
dreams.
[SPEAKER_07]: Groovy.
[SPEAKER_07]: If anybody's got a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it for David Downs and Desiree
and Sunny and George.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Nathan already.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to start the question for that
audience.
[SPEAKER_08]: The 3 p.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: crowd going strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: First question is over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: The the you guys touched on a lot of how
to form partners within the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: sector.
[SPEAKER_06]: Were there different or in your
experience, has there been different
[SPEAKER_06]: partners, say with ancillary businesses or
certain say cultivars processors?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even dispensaries that you would
recommend or recommend shying away from?
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll give everybody like 30
seconds answer because we're going to wrap
[SPEAKER_07]: it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say look for who's got cosines
like as someone reputable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have they been around to other people
cosign them?
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a track record of experience
versus like an unproven partner where
[SPEAKER_07]: they're saying they're promising the
world, but they don't have much to show
[SPEAKER_07]: for it yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a reason why people with a large
reputations might be more pricey to work
[SPEAKER_07]: with than someone new.
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, in the cultivation space on
the breeder side, it's wild and woolly
[SPEAKER_07]: right now and seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when I'm writing about seeds and
who's got good ones, I look for who's
[SPEAKER_07]: winning awards, who other growers want to
work with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is like a proxy for their
quality, like the cosines.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody else coming build on that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just gossip among your friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have another question over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in the back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Stephanie Pow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the founder of Emerald Lane
Recruitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're revolutionizing how recruitment and
HR services are delivered to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: space across the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is these days there's a lot of
people who are consultants and fractional.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzzword is fractional everything
these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I see from my side is the
difference between a partner, a true
[SPEAKER_00]: partner and a consultant and so as people
are and there's so many consultants
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to actually be a true partner to
our clients and to customers we're
[SPEAKER_00]: serving, what do you see the big
difference between actually being a
[SPEAKER_00]: partner versus a consultant and how has
that been successful with the companies
[SPEAKER_00]: you've actually truly partnered with?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can answer that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you are a partner into let's say a
manufacturing company, you need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: vested into the products that is
developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: As example, we work with a number of
universities and we hired consultants in
[SPEAKER_02]: the beginning but they're professors in
university that help us to develop our
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've been awarded even after we
start selling the systems because their
[SPEAKER_02]: direct work was appreciated and was in the
foundation with what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we treated them as partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as you're vested into this
business with your customer then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: become partner but they also have to
recognize you for that and give you the
[SPEAKER_02]: credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a long term relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like a year or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as soon as this value is built and
created and improved every year this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: great way to create a partnership.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have one more.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm back here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sitting down.
[SPEAKER_08]: My feet hurt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Luke Monroe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fund of Plan Purpose Media,
filmmaker, storyteller.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very lucky to interview people from
the international cannabis industry for
[SPEAKER_01]: the last 10 years and hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen people who knew their why
being very successful in forming strategic
[SPEAKER_01]: partnerships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would really like to know from you
on stage what's your thought on knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: your why and how this is helping you not
only form successful partnerships but
[SPEAKER_01]: being successful in the long term.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can tell you from for our company
it's about we're a life science company.
[SPEAKER_05]: The goal is to try and improve health.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's ultimately what we're trying to
do whether it's with the cannabis or with
[SPEAKER_05]: the cancer research or with vaccine
production or large scale insect pest
[SPEAKER_05]: control.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our goal is to make the world better
easier for people to live in and help
[SPEAKER_05]: people be more healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean that's that's what our ultimate
goal is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's that's why we look for partners
who are trying to do the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go George.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't be emotional.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Passion and emotions are two different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Passion helps you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Emotion harms you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: In business everything is numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be sure you have the value
that value has a number and you have the
[SPEAKER_02]: return that you expect to and do it with
passion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we at time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well this is such an important topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got eight and eleven year old boys.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're forming strategic partners for
life right now making friends on the yard.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't get any more basic than this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean these people will be with them
their lives and in the business sense
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe it's not like that kind of
friendship but it's that kind of long term
[SPEAKER_07]: strategic relationship.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it doesn't get any more
foundational.
[SPEAKER_07]: The why is so important.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't know a person's why their
reason for being what what's motivating
[SPEAKER_07]: what's operating them you don't know the
first thing about them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I hope you take some of these
lessons out in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dig deep into the people you want to work
with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you're aligned and then start
small and build outward from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure it's the right fit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't don't get into something you need to
get out of later.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad to hear was 90 percent fail rate
for the first one though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks George.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it again for our panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure they'd love to talk to you more
in the foyer if you like.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the International Cannabis
Business Conference Barcelona 2024.
