[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an extraction guy myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been involved in just learning and
educating about the glandular trichome and
[SPEAKER_00]: where these medicines that we are so often
talking about, where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthesized in the plant, where they're
produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I learned a lot about glandular
trichomes and the different types and how
[SPEAKER_00]: these different cannabinoids and terpene
compounds are biosynthesized inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: glandular trichome head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I helped popularize water
hash over the course for the last 17
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very much more into like sieving than
extracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a unique panel for me
to moderate because both of these
[SPEAKER_00]: gentlemen are doing things that I haven't
been involved with as much over the course
[SPEAKER_00]: of the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm also very excited to hear what they
have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start out with... My name is Andy
Joseph.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Apex Supercritical.
[SPEAKER_02]: My story briefly, I started Apex
Supercritical as a side job in 2001.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spent six years in the Navy, did
submarines out of Pearl Harbor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after I got out of the military,
went to Ohio State for welding
[SPEAKER_02]: engineering, GI bill doesn't pay for all
of your school.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to make a few extra bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started a fabrication business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ran across a customer who needed some
botanical oil extraction equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I don't know what that is,
but I'll make it and give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really wanted to have boots on the
ground to understand the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of our employees are from the medical
industry, both the growers and our lab
[SPEAKER_01]: techs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of were good at knowing what we
don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we knew we didn't know enough about
extraction and about concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we found the best team that we could,
brought them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really when we started
exploring molecular separation and
[SPEAKER_01]: distillation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought the technology in about three
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really had to dial in the parameters
of the equipment that we were using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we figured out how you were able to
basically target cannabinoids and leave
[SPEAKER_01]: behind the impurities and the undesirable
part of the plant, we really thought we
[SPEAKER_01]: were headed somewhere with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We contacted the manufacturer,
which was VTA in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been a global leader in
manufacturing distillation equipment over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last two and a half decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their equipment is used in petroleum
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used in agricultural industry and
the pharmaceutical industry.
