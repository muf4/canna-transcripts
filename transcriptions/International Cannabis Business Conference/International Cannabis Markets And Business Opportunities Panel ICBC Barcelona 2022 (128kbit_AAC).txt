[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, to discuss international cannabis
markets and business opportunities,
[SPEAKER_02]: leading this panel, co-founders of SNF
Abogados, please welcome Guillermo
[SPEAKER_02]: Fernandez Navarro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, hello.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, hello.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning to everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Guillermo Fernandez.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a co-founder and attorney at SNF
Abogados.
[SPEAKER_05]: SNF Abogados is a law firm specializing in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are based in Madrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been working on cannabis over 10
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are involved in any single cannabis
area, such as medical cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_05]: licensing, hemp, CBD products,
cannabis clubs, criminal defense.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say that it's amazing to see
this theater full of people again after
[SPEAKER_05]: two years talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say thank you to ACBC for making
this event a possible event.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope everyone enjoys it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's start with this amazing panel we
have today.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to talk about legal framework and
business opportunities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please let me introduce our panelists.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Chloe Grossman.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chloe is the executive director of
Corporate Growth at Trulip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trulip is the biggest cannabis company in
the US right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, we have Kai Frederich.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a founder and lawyer at KFN Plus in
Berlin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have Juana Vasella.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're at MME Zurich.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's have them introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chloe, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Chloe Grossman.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm executive director of Corporate Growth
at Trulip Cannabis Corp.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're a multi-state operator in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my job entails overseeing post-merger
and acquisition integration, as well as
[SPEAKER_06]: expansion into new markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the reasons I'm on this panel
is I have a long history of working in the
[SPEAKER_06]: competitive licensing field in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_06]: So happy to be here with all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Kai Frederich Niemann.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a lawyer from Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a lawyer since 2003 and started to
work in the cannabis space in 2017 as
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany legalized medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm consulting CBD companies, hemp
companies, medical cannabis import
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also an advisor to IHA, to the
European Industrial Hemp Association,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is setting up a novel food joint
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we are looking for legalization
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of my main focus,
regulatory approvals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, as well, Guillermo,
for a kind explanation and introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Juana Vasella.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm specialized in medical law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm here, because I want to
speak about medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as well, I'm a professor for business
law, specialized in health law in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have, like, two point of views.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a disclaimer, as a lawyer,
maybe I will have, let's say, a weird kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of view on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's start with the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk, first of all, about the
licensing process and legal framework.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you please, Chloe, let us know how is
the situation in US or in the United
[SPEAKER_05]: States?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the situation in the United States is
pretty unique.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first thing to note is that at the
federal level, cannabis is actually not
[SPEAKER_06]: legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's considered a schedule one controlled
substance, meaning it doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_06]: recognized medicinal use and also is
considered to have high potential for
[SPEAKER_06]: abuse.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the way that American law is set up,
the division of state and federal
[SPEAKER_06]: authority gives states a lot of power over
writing their own laws within their own
[SPEAKER_06]: boundaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that has allowed states to experiment
with cannabis policy within their borders.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they effectively decide whether to
regulate cannabis as well as how to
[SPEAKER_06]: regulate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this has led to patchwork of state
regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So every state is very different,
which I think is important to understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the licensing structures and the
markets and the way that the markets are
[SPEAKER_06]: structured are very intertwined in the US
and I think probably everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the dynamics between those two shape
the business opportunities as well as the
[SPEAKER_06]: strategies that businesses use to succeed
in this market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll talk a little bit about that
later.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of the ways that states differ
in structure and licensing process,
[SPEAKER_06]: there are some more restrictive states
which tend to have limited license systems
[SPEAKER_06]: and those systems typically have higher
barriers to entry and are attractive for
[SPEAKER_06]: reasons that I think we can all
understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many unlimited license states see
explosive growth and one of the things
[SPEAKER_06]: that's really interesting about those
states is you really see the innovation
[SPEAKER_06]: and the excitement of a true capitalist
environment that's hyper competitive.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also licensing both at the state
and local level, sometimes both at the
[SPEAKER_06]: same time in one market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So some states, typically more
conservative ones, choose not to give the
[SPEAKER_06]: localities any control, whereas others
like California actually give a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: control to the localities and that creates
a whole different situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when the localities do have control,
you tend to have longer licensing
[SPEAKER_06]: processes, you tend to have higher costs
and just frankly more headaches.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is something to watch out for if
you're looking at cannabis markets in the
[SPEAKER_06]: United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are also four different licensing
processes that I would categorize them
[SPEAKER_06]: into.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first is competitive licensing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is typical of limited license
processes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, high barriers to entry and it's
kind of like a professional battle royale
[SPEAKER_06]: for these coveted licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second type is a lottery licensing
model.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in that case, all companies that meet a
set of minimum standards have their name
[SPEAKER_06]: thrown into the hat, so to speak,
and are randomly selected to get licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the purpose of that model is basically
to try to leave in the playing field and
[SPEAKER_06]: also cut down on bias in the license award
process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another different model is just a straight
minimum standards model and this is very
[SPEAKER_06]: typical of unlimited license markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anybody who meets the minimum standards
is able to get a license.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then finally, this is a little bit
different, but there's grandfathering of
[SPEAKER_06]: existing operators.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's say a market is going from
medical to adult use.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at that catalyst point, the medical
operators are typically grandfathered in
[SPEAKER_06]: or have some process for converting into
the new market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they kind of get first right of entry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I think those are the key points
and I will pass it back to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you, Chloe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to add one line more, when do you
think we will see a federal regulation?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the billion dollar question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are seeing support on both sides of the
aisle at the federal level now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it will be within the next
year, but we've been saying within the
[SPEAKER_06]: next two years for quite a while now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's anyone's guess, but we are
definitely pushing behind the scenes for
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Kai, how is the situation in Germany?
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people are excited about the
latest news.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Germany had a federal election last
year in September and the parties,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially the Green Party and the
Liberals, they declared or they said they
[SPEAKER_01]: want legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Social Democrat Party they were in
favor of model projects before that,
[SPEAKER_01]: beforehand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it turned out in the coalition
negotiations that they really agreed on a
[SPEAKER_01]: free market model on a legalization with
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a short passage in the
coalition agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they say it's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have no problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the draft of the law will be
dealt.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ministry of Health is responsible,
is in charge for this draft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Ministry of Health is also
responsible for corona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is also responsible for the health
crisis coming by the Ukraine crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have lots of refugees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're expecting 10 million refugees in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many people will come to Germany as
well again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have to integrate these people
into the health system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Ministry of Health is very,
very busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is in charge of the draft because
it's a health issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a harm reduction health issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Ministry of Health is supposed to
deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said already, Karl Lauterbach,
there won't be a draft this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he will start working with his
ministry, with his house.
[SPEAKER_01]: He will start working on the draft early
next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the debate is sort of in the opposite
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of off this year on the
legalization side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are still some really problems,
some crucial problems we have to solve,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially the licensing question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a draft in place by the Green
Party, the so-called Cannabis Control Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: They brought that to Bundestag in 2017,
the first time, and last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: the second time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this draft foresees caps and minimum
distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minimum distances between schools and
youth facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minimum distances are no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the caps, the restrictions on maximum
numbers for dispensaries in a community,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is a real problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you issue a license and the
authority exercises its discretion,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to pick, who to pick, and if you have,
let's say, 20 licenses you can give away
[SPEAKER_01]: in one community, but you have 200
interested parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the authority has to make a decision
who to pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they didn't use their discretion
properly, and your competitor says,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, no, the authority made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they start a lawsuit, a competitor
lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you may get your license and
start working and start selling and start
[SPEAKER_01]: investing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after two years, the court says,
no, I will withdraw your license because
[SPEAKER_01]: your competitor won.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be a big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will do all we can this year to
convince the lawmakers that there are no
[SPEAKER_01]: need for caps, for maximum number
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is no need.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all say we need restrictions on the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scientists, the drug scientists,
and social workers are saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you have an unrestricted number of
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantage is you can start from day
one with enough dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can fight the illicit market really
effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there will, of course, be a market
checkout.
[SPEAKER_01]: After two or three years, because of the
oversupply.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what I think is the better
option for Germany to choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will see how that will unfold this
year, the debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's saying it's coming from the
government.
[SPEAKER_01]: But please be patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also demanded decriminalization in the
first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the coalition said, no, we want one
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want one draft.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want one solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not decriminalization beforehand and
then legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that endangers the whole project.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, courts are still judging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Law enforcement is still working on
cannabis cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still chasing after consumers
right now, after CBD businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we still have to do some advocating
this year and some lobbying this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm convinced it's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all saying, all members who have
the power in the coalition say that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's not going to be easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really hope that Germany regulates
cannabis because that would be an amazing
[SPEAKER_05]: example for the rest of countries in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let us know, Juana, how is everything
going in Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Switzerland is called the
European hub of cannabis, as you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the social relation of cannabis
differentiates between the three different
[SPEAKER_00]: uses, the industrial, the medical,
and the recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, I had three different
regulations I'm going to speak about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least, I will speak about the
latest developments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to know, it's all about the
T8 and THC concentration and respect of
[SPEAKER_00]: the CBD content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike THC, CBD in Switzerland is not
considered as a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So firstly, let's have a look on the
industrial use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Swiss laws regarding the industrial
use is very liberal, as you know already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the industrial cannabis that is less
than 1%, we speak always about this limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1% is not legally a narcotic, but is
subject to the regulation of how it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's food, cosmetics, tobacco,
whatever else, chemicals, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the uses permitted are determined by
these regulations, food, cosmetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: liquids for tobacco, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want some, I can give later on
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the discussion, detailed information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the status for the industrial use,
it is legal in Switzerland, as long as it
[SPEAKER_00]: contains less than 1% of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a look on the medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Swiss law regarding the medicinal
cannabis is, let's say, surprisingly
[SPEAKER_00]: limited in comparison to the industrial
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing, selling, importing cannabis
for medical uses or medical purpose is
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's a distinction between
cannabis containing at least 1% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to differentiate between the
cannabis at least 1% THC and less than 1%
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, cannabis containing at least
1% THC is qualified as a narcotic,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it can be qualified as a medical
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be very interesting for some of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, the specific, specific
medicinal product relation applies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the cannabis can only be grown,
imported, and sold for medical use if
[SPEAKER_00]: permitted by the federal office for the
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's permitted, but you need the
permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis containing less than 1%
intended to be used for medical purpose is
[SPEAKER_00]: subject to the general, just the normal,
let's say, normal regulation of medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that, you can manufacture,
who will say, a marketing and market
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, or in these days, the patients have
access to authorized cannabis-based drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: only on medical prescription, but they
have access.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cannabis containing at least 1% THC,
patients can apply via their physicians
[SPEAKER_00]: that permission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can have say, or we can say it's
legal, cannabis in Switzerland is legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it contains more or at least
1% THC, but you need an official permit
[SPEAKER_00]: and a medical prescription, but it's
allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thirdly, the recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some of you will be interested in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the adult recreational cannabis use has
been decriminalized in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis containing at least 1%,
at least 1%, in comparison to other
[SPEAKER_00]: European countries, a lot, is qualified as
a narcotic, but production, importation,
[SPEAKER_00]: selling of cannabis use is not allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting, the personal
possession of cannabis with at least 1% of
[SPEAKER_00]: fewer than 10 grams, is not even subject
to a fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not allowed, but you can have at
least, or not, you can have up to 10 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: and you will not be fined.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very Swiss approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the status regarding the recreational
use is it's illegal if it contains at
[SPEAKER_00]: least 1% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1%, less it's allowed, but at least 10%
it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though you will approach very low
fines.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be very interesting is to speak
about the latest developments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two movements regarding firstly,
the recreational use, and secondly,
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding recreational use, in May 2021,
the Swiss government started a limited 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years pilot program, a pilot project to
study the economic and the health impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: of non-cannibal uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember, the medical use is allowed,
but now we have the pilot project to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a look on what happens with the
non-medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the Swiss Federal Office of
Public Health, issues production permits
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis growers to supply the program,
and a variety of THC and CBD products will
[SPEAKER_00]: be available to the pilot participants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe somebody of you want to be a
volunteer with this program, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis pilot schemes are
requested by public or private
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations, and they have to work
together with research institutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a look on the conditions when
you get or how it's possible to get such a
[SPEAKER_00]: permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have to fulfill?
[SPEAKER_00]: The programs, they must have a specific
research goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, such as acquiring data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So acquiring data, it's a very wide idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody of you would be interested in,
for example, data on the socioeconomic
[SPEAKER_00]: effects on the cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pilot programs have to be limited,
that's a problem maybe, to a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: municipality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may run for five years, but there's the
opportunity to extend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I thought, it's very interesting,
the participants are limited to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: milligram THC per month, and the products
cannot, in the law they say, they cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: contain more than 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a lot in their hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, some opportunities for the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So producers are held to strict quality
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to follow field tries that are
conducted in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are allowed, as I said before,
volunteers, participants, up to 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe some of you would be joining or
wanted to join.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and there's another late development
regarding medical use, as I said before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland, or the Swiss government,
plans to facilitate the access to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: use treatments, cannabis use or based
medicinal products for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in June 2020, two years ago,
the federal council issued the draft
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation, and it has to come in force
this summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very close that we will be offered
with new opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under the amended law, patients will
be able to obtain cannabis-based
[SPEAKER_00]: treatments directly from doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will no longer be necessary to
require an exceptional permit by the
[SPEAKER_00]: authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can explain about the medical use
program later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in the end, about the license,
as I said before, there's a national
[SPEAKER_00]: program that opens opportunities for
growers, producers, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just the last year, the federal office
already issued some licensees,
[SPEAKER_00]: the so-called cannabis licensees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the regulations and requirements of
the procedure are extremely high,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we could help to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among other things, a safety concept and
the quality management must be
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can fulfill, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, experience in cultivation of
cannabis and the compliance with the GA CP
[SPEAKER_00]: guidelines, it means good agriculture and
collection practice, and the attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainability and ecology will pay off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at last, it would be easier,
but it's not a condition that it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis product of Swiss origin that
complies with the Swiss rules of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want, I can give you some
detailed information later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially, I have a checklist prepared
for producers, growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the interest to go into the
Swiss market, especially for the pilot
[SPEAKER_00]: trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, thank you so much, Juana.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope Switzerland moves forward to get
the integral regulation sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: To add two lines about how the situation
in Spain, we still have a lot of work to
[SPEAKER_05]: do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are working on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the use of medical and recreational
cannabis in Spain is not regulated yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: The latest news is that an expert
commission to talk about medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: just started two days ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will work until June.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see what happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see if it's positive and wait for
the result.
[SPEAKER_05]: About CBD, the CBD market is not regulated
either in Spain.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a really big CBD market in Spain.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find different products.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go around the city, you will see so
many shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find cosmetics products,
maybe some food supplement either.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as I said, it's not regulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: All these companies are working in a gray
area.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the market is getting bigger and
bigger, even more after the European court
[SPEAKER_05]: resolution, like almost two years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I cannot wait for the European Union
regulation to regulate at least CBD sooner
[SPEAKER_05]: than later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, we have in Spain some companies
growing medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But these companies have to export the
product to legal markets with an
[SPEAKER_05]: authorized or a legal distributor.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how is the situation in Spain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we can keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's talk about the second point.
[SPEAKER_05]: In front of this panel, let's talk about
licensing requirements.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please, Chloe, let us know.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we need to get a license in the
United States?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just like pretty much everything in the
United States related to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: it really differs substantially from state
to state.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some common threads,
though.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are what I'll focus on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So first of all, the most boring one,
but the business basics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to have business formation
documents, usually insurance, tax
[SPEAKER_06]: accounts, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's pretty typical.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second thing is your team and a lot of
documents related to your team.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what your team consists of depends on
the state, how they define it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's typically owners, people who are
operating the business, or controlling the
[SPEAKER_06]: business, financial interest holders,
and in some cases, employees, contractors,
[SPEAKER_06]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think one of the things that always
shocks people when they start to get into
[SPEAKER_06]: the licensing process in cannabis in the
US is that if you are an owner or one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the other people who needs to make
disclosures, you are going to have a very
[SPEAKER_06]: deep dive into your background.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll give you one example.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a state that I previously worked in,
there were requests for the tax returns
[SPEAKER_06]: for the last five years, not just of the
owners, but of their spouses and for every
[SPEAKER_06]: business that they have any amount of
business interest in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's like an unbelievable amount of
documentation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, some states require the team to meet
professional standards.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you may have to have a chemist on board
or something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, states also sometimes try to
limit ownership only to people who are
[SPEAKER_06]: local to that state, but that often gets
chucked down in courts of law.
[SPEAKER_06]: So beyond team, property is probably the
most critical thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So locking down a property early,
very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: You also have to typically have local
zoning or land use authorizations to go
[SPEAKER_06]: along with that property.
[SPEAKER_06]: So property control is a must.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether current or conditioned on
licensure, and highly recommend
[SPEAKER_06]: conditioned on licensure because there's
often lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you locked down a property,
you may be paying a lease for two years,
[SPEAKER_06]: three years while lawsuits are being
resolved.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you have all of that taken care of,
then you typically have to provide a
[SPEAKER_06]: repair facility design, a construction
schedule because there's often,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially in new markets, a lot of
interest in how quickly you can get to
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Funding is also a critical thing,
and the amount of funding that you have to
[SPEAKER_06]: have in order to apply differs greatly
from state to state, but we've seen having
[SPEAKER_06]: to have $2 million in liquid capital in a
bank account.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it can be quite substantial.
[SPEAKER_06]: You also have to have plans of operations
or what we refer to as narratives.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could submit standard operating
procedures in some cases, but you
[SPEAKER_06]: typically don't want to in order to
protect your processes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you end up preparing these very
detailed descriptions of exactly what
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to do in your business.
[SPEAKER_06]: So cultivation, manufacturing,
dispensing, but also things like security,
[SPEAKER_06]: community impact, and so many other
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's where consultants often come
into play because sometimes applications
[SPEAKER_06]: can be a thousand plus pages.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, local support is really important,
so you may have to actually have a letter
[SPEAKER_06]: of support from the local government or
some type of local license depending on
[SPEAKER_06]: what the application requirements are.
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally, things that set you apart.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that may be partnerships, research that
you're doing, philanthropy, environmental
[SPEAKER_06]: initiatives, diversity, equity,
and inclusion initiatives.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really just depends on what your
company specializes in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I'll just go over a few pieces of
advice for how to win in these competitive
[SPEAKER_06]: markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: So first, play to your strengths,
but also understand what the state is
[SPEAKER_06]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's really critical to analyze
public meetings, laws and regulations,
[SPEAKER_06]: application materials, and also who are
the key players who are involved both in
[SPEAKER_06]: regulating cannabis, writing the laws,
etc., and understanding by reading between
[SPEAKER_06]: the lines what the priorities are and what
they're looking for in a licensee.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you can find where you can deliver
based on your unique value that you bring
[SPEAKER_06]: as a company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second, if you are in a competitive
licensing process, you absolutely must
[SPEAKER_06]: distinguish yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: You cannot just rely on the bare minimum
of what they're asking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had clients in the past say,
oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to give them exactly what
they're asking for across the board.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can tell you, those clients pretty
much always fail.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to go above and beyond in every
regard.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's a lottery process, you should be
strategic and consider the fact that it's
[SPEAKER_06]: a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there are geographic limits and you
can only apply once in different
[SPEAKER_06]: geographies, you should probably apply
once in each geography.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, if you can apply both in populated
areas and less populated areas,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's also a pretty good strategy because
if the pool is smaller, your probability
[SPEAKER_06]: of winning is higher.
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally, expect lawsuits don't lock
yourself into anything that is going to
[SPEAKER_06]: drain you financially if you have to wait
for two or three years while legal matters
[SPEAKER_06]: are resolved.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kai, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I can add, I can agree on most
points except of the lottery system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only have the draft in Germany,
the cannabis control act by the Greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the blueprint because it's a
complete law.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really 60, 70 pages long,
export, import, free market model,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will also be a federal law so there
won't be any interstate commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can have as much licenses as you
want to when you get one in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is also clear is that the staff
members, the staff has to be trained.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Ministry of Justice, the Secretary of
Justice has confirmed that the basic
[SPEAKER_01]: thought of the cannabis control act is the
social responsibility of this act.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get the free market, you get the
legalized market, but on the other hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: to regulate that,
[SPEAKER_01]: to fight the negative consequences,
you have to have strict social
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibilities in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the staff has to be trained.
[SPEAKER_01]: The staff has to have a certificate of
responsible selling in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knows yet how intense and how long
these education will look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have to look at the US or Canada
for other examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the law says the staff member has to
know about how cannabis works and about
[SPEAKER_01]: prevention options.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to identify risky consummation
patterns with their clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to talk about it with their
clients, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the shops have to have a social
concept in place so they have to have in
[SPEAKER_01]: written concept how they will fit in their
community, in the neighborhood,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what are they doing about prevention
and drug addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have to be affiliated with the
drug prevention associations, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole set of regulations concerning
the social responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have to work this out as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, next year, the details,
how intense it will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this will come.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your expertise, Kai.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are soon to come to the end now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like always, we have to give the
audience a chance to ask a few questions,
[SPEAKER_03]: or at least one question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's not more time than one
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's a question, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see there's one question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you the microphone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Niemann, you mentioned about
dispensaries and shopping in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what about the growing licenses in
Germany?
[SPEAKER_04]: As I know, there is 13 lots in 2019 after
the last tender.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they planning to give more licensing
in this draft?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cultivation is also possible,
according to this draft, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I doubt that cultivating of
recreational cannabis in Germany has a
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have a demand of 400 to 600
tons for dried flowers alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would have to set up facilities and
plants for cultivation, like we see them
[SPEAKER_01]: in Switzerland, with big investments of
20, 25 million pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would need 20, 30 facilities of these
to cover the demand domestically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think this makes sense from a
climate perspective as well, because these
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities are really energy consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are many, many facilities all
over the world, in Lesotho, in South
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa, Colombia, North Macedonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their facilities in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have better weather conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Germany, I think, will have to rely on
imports for a long time, or for all most
[SPEAKER_01]: of the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have three domestic licenses
granted in 2019 for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Liberal Party said they want to
make Germany a medical cannabis export
[SPEAKER_01]: nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we might see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be new tenders for medical
cannabis cultivation, so that Germany can
[SPEAKER_01]: also supply domestically the medical
cannabis market globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you should come to Switzerland,
because we have a use rate of 8.7%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very big black and white market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you could discuss later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much to the panelists.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we do have time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're running up against it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it again for our panelists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, let's hear it for Mika, for running
around handing people a lightning bolt.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have more questions, I'm sure
they'd love to meet you outside,
[SPEAKER_02]: right outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could practically corner them and
ask them all the questions you want,
[SPEAKER_02]: politely, politely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure people, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all so very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it one more time for our panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to move right along.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super lightning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
