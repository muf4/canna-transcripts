[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to thank you all so much
for being here today at beautiful Lake
[SPEAKER_01]: Bled I've got to tell you guys all that I
Envisioned this that the first time I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought about this event was five years
ago, and I thought It's time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be time soon to come to Slovenia and
help Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife is Slovenian I'll speak a little
Slovak, but today only English because my
[SPEAKER_01]: Slovak is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But give me one or two years and I will
love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be better, I promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You Slovenians are so cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really hard language.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a little time, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a great event for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to say a couple things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank the Tallman Group.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all the people in the Tallman Group
that helped put this event together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to give a big shout out to the
director of the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you had communications with her,
Liza Vieta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please give it up for Liza.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to thank our development
director for Tallman Group who's running
[SPEAKER_01]: media today, Jaka Jez.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give it up for Jaka.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's making a lot of things happen here
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of all I want to thank you guys
because you're here and we have a goal and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's to modernize cannabis policy in
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we all know in Slovenia what
some of the circumstances are or have been
[SPEAKER_01]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slovenia has been maybe a little behind on
their cannabis policy reform, but that all
[SPEAKER_01]: changes now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it changes because we are all here
together as an industry, as a community,
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing this public policy forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very important that when we push
public policy forward for Slovenia that we
[SPEAKER_01]: understand Slovenia's sensitive ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not just ecologically, that's
socially.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a small country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a special country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything we do has to be special.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people don't know that when they come
to Slovenia and everyone seems to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my God, they think it's some outback,
Far East outback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here you come to Slovenia and you get
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's very impressed with
everything Slovenia does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is very friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it happens to be my favorite country
in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to thank all you Slovenians
for letting me live in your country and be
[SPEAKER_01]: part of your culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just thank you very much for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinch me because I feel like I'm dreaming
every day in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, we have a great event for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking things to the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm about to introduce you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see you over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, I'd like to introduce our MC for
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's our MC and brand ambassador for ICBC
for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met him in 1994 in San Francisco when we
were in bands and played basketball and
[SPEAKER_01]: did all those fun things kids do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But without further ado, please give a
warm Slovenian welcome to our host and MC,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ungayo Bilo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dobre jutro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all so very much for coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex said a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make a couple of quick
announcements.
[SPEAKER_00]: This conference will be in English for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need a translation, we have
translators available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the headpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And listen here, everyone here,
your English is better than mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we're accepting donations to help
the flood victims from other parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go into the exhibitor hall,
there's a place where you can donate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd like to thank the Talmud group
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And party tonight at the castle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a shuttle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take everybody up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to find your own way
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no.
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stagger down the hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have shuttles that will bring you back,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnifico is going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's fantastic.
Thank you.
