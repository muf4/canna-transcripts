[SPEAKER_02]: Give a little overview.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Bo Whitney, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bo Whitney.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank ICBC for hosting this
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been really impressed by not only
the quality of the speakers, but also the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of the participants at the
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hats off to you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate the opportunity to speak
in front of you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be a little bit of overlap from
the previous presenter, but he seemed a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit preventer because he was
telling it like it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Bo Whitney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the Senior Economist at New Frontier
Data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been in the industry about five
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And never in my wildest dreams did I think
that as an economist I'd be talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: weed in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's representative of just
the pace of the transformation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I'm going to talk about a global
cannabis outlook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to first talk high level and
then pare it down into the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to talk about higher THC
cannabis, adult use and medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also want to touch upon this
emerging industry of the industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit about New Frontier Data.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Frontier Data is an independent
technology driven analytics company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're specialized in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We offer vetted data that is actionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good business intelligence and it
looks at risk management as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're four years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that four years we've been cited in
over 82 countries with our data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a media reach of seven billion
impressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've really been considered an
authority on cannabis data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that we get our data is that we
reach into certain aspects of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, all aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get governmental data, NGO data,
state and provincial regulator data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also marry that with consumer
data and auxiliary data and point of sale
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we agglomerate all that data into a
business intelligence portal called Equio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there we can have consumers
subscribe to the portal or we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: customer report and advisory services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our business partners and clients
are some of the largest in the world from
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloomberg to Boston Consulting Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've also touched upon even the
smallest of actors in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we want to do our best to look at
all facets and all channels of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over 60 countries around the world have
now legalized either medical cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you, as operators and
investors, even though it may be a local
[SPEAKER_00]: issue for you, you really have to think
global about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The previous presenter talked about things
going on in South Africa, also
[SPEAKER_00]: advancements in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this pace of legalization
that's sweeping the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a real exciting time to be
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of total demand, roughly based
upon our analysis, roughly 6% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: adults in the world have consumed cannabis
in the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that translates into almost 300 million
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at Germany right now,
what arguably 20 to 40,000 patients have
[SPEAKER_00]: used, got prescription in the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even in Germany there's this huge
untapped market that's associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is, this is just the tip of
the iceberg in terms of overall demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some continents have higher usage
rates than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not uncommon for consumers in legal
markets to have higher percentage of usage
[SPEAKER_00]: rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa has a long tradition of cannabis
use and cultivation and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Europe is right about where the
average is across the globe, 6% versus
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.9.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how does that translate into dollars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we are in the process of publishing
a global reports on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's due out next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our forecast for the total globe with
just higher THC cannabis, not including
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp, is $344 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ranges from 200 billion to 500
billion, but the midpoint is right around
[SPEAKER_00]: $344 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's just, once again, it's this
huge market that is relatively untapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as consumers transition from illicit to
legal, there'll be this greater
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for you as you get into this
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe is the third largest based upon our
forecast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's $68 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia is just this tremendous market.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it's population driven,
but it's also usage driven as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, although we're in Europe,
a lot of the speakers have talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: the Canadian market and the US market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen a lot of eye rolls from the
Europeans present here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's because there's this legal market
and it's because of the size of the market
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's setting the precedent for other
countries to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Canada is making good inroads on their
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not without its weaknesses,
but definitely it's setting the stage for
[SPEAKER_00]: others to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 2018, or I'm sorry, 2019,
$16 billion of legal sales in Canada and
[SPEAKER_00]: the US combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's growing to $32 billion by 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't even include some of the
emerging states like New York,
[SPEAKER_00]: New Jersey, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growth there is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can ride the tide now in order
to capture larger markets later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, because there's this popularity in
the US, because there's this large market
[SPEAKER_00]: in the US and Canada, investment funds
have been investing tremendous amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: into the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since 2015, over $19 billion have been
invested in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how does that apply to Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the $19 billion is being accumulated
and then redeployed into other markets
[SPEAKER_00]: like Europe, like Africa and Latin
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a couple of notable items that
the pace of this investment is
[SPEAKER_00]: accelerating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost $14 billion of investment just last
year alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was driven primarily by some of
these large players in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such as Constellation Brands, their
investment into Canopy Growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Altria's investment into Kronos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So combined there, it's almost $6 billion
of investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is that big actors,
big players are coming into the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a small actor that's already
established, then you really should have
[SPEAKER_00]: an exit strategy associated with this so
that either you can be acquired by the
[SPEAKER_00]: large actors or that you can understand
where you're at relative to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know a lot of people say,
well, why should I have an exit strategy
[SPEAKER_00]: when I haven't even begun operations?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really important to have that
already established so that when the
[SPEAKER_00]: market turns or commoditization of prices
occur, then you'll know where you stand
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can either get out or join forces
with others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the European market,
like I mentioned, $68 billion of the total
[SPEAKER_00]: addressable market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's illicit and legal combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listed the top 15 markets here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Germany ranks roughly third,
almost $10 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all these numbers are in dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just moving forward for the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at $10 billion, that's a sizable
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relatively untapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the attractiveness because
there's large markets, there's large
[SPEAKER_00]: potential, and relatively untapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why a lot of folks are preparing to
enter into this space, either from North
[SPEAKER_00]: America, Latin America, or Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the ways that companies can
differentiate themselves is through
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, either to drive efficiencies
or differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And technology is entering into this space
at a massive pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's disrupting a number of sectors,
and all sectors, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between cultivation, processing,
delivery mechanisms, and data,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of these are being invested in and
disrupting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to be aware, as an investor
and as an operator, that these
[SPEAKER_00]: technological advances are occurring so
that you can keep pace with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of these technology innovations
are because the consumer behavior is
[SPEAKER_00]: changing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So New Frontier Data just published one of
the largest consumer data reports in the
[SPEAKER_00]: history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's US and Canada-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we did is we did this consumer
survey, and then we married it with $6
[SPEAKER_00]: billion of transactional data to ascertain
what the consumer preferences were and
[SPEAKER_00]: then where they sit relative to the
overall usage spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've identified nine different
archetypes of consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one uses for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one uses different amounts,
and they have different preferences in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of delivery mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is important to know,
as operators, because if you're targeting
[SPEAKER_00]: one product to the wrong archetype,
then you're not going to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding the consumer is
critically important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, for the first time, we've got the
data to show the preferences and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's no longer just this medical
and recreational user.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a deeper dive into the
consumer behavior and preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's nuances associated with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based upon the survey results,
it's interesting that the reasons that
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers are using are not just for
social.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more so for wellness and health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very interesting for me
because in yesterday's presentations on
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical side, there was a lot of data
being presented on the impact that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis has on the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that aligns almost identically to what
consumers are using cannabis for,
[SPEAKER_00]: for relaxation, stress, relief,
sleep, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this was surprising compared to
what we were talking about yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at this, only 19% use
cannabis just because they were bored or
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to do it socially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in addition to that, cannabis has
medical applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 73% of the consumers that are surveyed
actually have used cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: substitute for other drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is showing up not only in
consumer patterns, but also in federal
[SPEAKER_00]: budgets and federal spending on
healthcare, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so other countries are interested in
this development because they want to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at their healthcare expenditures,
like Germany, for example, and adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: accordingly and support more cannabis use
rather than opioid use as just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 94% of the consumers surveyed said
that when they use it for a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, that there was some improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just another example of why
there's a benefit to doing more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper dive into the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I mentioned, here's some data from
the US, but I mentioned that as cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is used as a substitute for other
medicine, they're reducing the healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: costs at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this example, 11% reduction in
governmental pain medicine spending for
[SPEAKER_00]: healthcare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other countries are seeing this result
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, they're looking at this
as a way to adjust their healthcare costs
[SPEAKER_00]: and address budget deficits and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as more and more research is out there
and more and more usage behaviors change,
[SPEAKER_00]: so does the demand for the cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And originally, especially in the United
States, this was a flower play and the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of the demand was in flower form,
pre-rolls, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as delivery mechanisms and technology
came in, innovation, then there was
[SPEAKER_00]: different product offerings, different
delivery mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, the consumer preference
and purchasing patterns changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over five, three year period,
demand for flower went down 39% in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States, whereas there were
increases in concentrates, edibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: and other delivery mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a fundamental shift in away
from flower and into derivative products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't just a US phenomenon,
this is a phenomenon that exists in all
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consumer preferences change as well
based upon other disrupting factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've listed five here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna read this whole thing,
but essentially as legal access expands,
[SPEAKER_00]: as social acceptance increases,
then the changes and preferences of the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer adjust to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a transformational event
where consumers change their preferences,
[SPEAKER_00]: change what they consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as business owners and as investors,
you have to be aware of these disruptive
[SPEAKER_00]: factors so that you're not left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so New Frontier Data can provide that
level of granularity in the data so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can keep pace and understand the
markets better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've talked a lot about higher THC
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to switch gears a little bit
to lower THC industrial cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a big market that is
rather under-appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to talk a little bit about
this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a lot of business that's
conducted in industrial hemp in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So New Frontier Data, just acquired the
Hemp Business Journal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very respected journal in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we brought on expertise for
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our forecast here shows that on a
global basis, there's a $3 billion global
[SPEAKER_00]: market right now that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's increasing, it's doubling
essentially over the next two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Europe is the biggest driver right now
in industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's emerging markets that are
coming in that could disrupt or displace
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe as one of the more mature markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to level set, the bright shining
object these days is CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody is focusing in on the CBD
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's industrial applications,
consumer applications, textiles,
[SPEAKER_00]: food, supplements, and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, BMW uses industrial hemp
on the interior of their cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this huge industrial
application associated with it that nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: is really talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a huge market well beyond the
CBD play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a few more slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got about five more minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hemp industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe is farther along now.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are global numbers, but they're a
billion dollar market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And textiles, $800 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD for just hemp-derived CBD,
almost $800 million in industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look closely at this chart,
you'll see that a majority of this demand
[SPEAKER_00]: is being satisfied by the European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the US reacts to legalization of
industrial hemp, look for the US to start
[SPEAKER_00]: flexing its muscle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's opportunities there that the
Europeans can take advantage of in the US
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whereas a lot of other countries are
targeting the European market for market
[SPEAKER_00]: entry strategies, the Europeans with their
expertise in industrial hemp can take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of the opportunities in the US
market as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hemp market in Europe is very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, it's mainly on the industrial,
like I mentioned, and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the market is shifting over more
towards consumer products and wellness
[SPEAKER_00]: brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just a small percentage of the
current revenues derived from industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I talked a little bit about the demand
for hemp products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting on the supply side.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the supply of industrial hemp
products is coming from China and Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, with France also being a
distant third in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But look for increases in cultivation,
not only in the European Union,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in places such as Africa and Asia and
South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in itself will have an effect on
pricing and the like, commoditization of
[SPEAKER_00]: pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as business owners in the hemp space,
you're going to need to be aware of those
[SPEAKER_00]: outside influences on the localized
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some key takeaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: 300 million consumers, huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's surging investment that is being
deployed around the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the CPG entrants, big tobacco,
alcohol, pharma, are providing the
[SPEAKER_00]: liquidity for the advances and development
of the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are an operator now, be sure to use
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to use data in order to drive
efficiencies so you can keep pace with the
[SPEAKER_00]: competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the European market is a target of a
lot of suppliers from outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you'll see in the coming years is
that there's going to be a consolidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, just in sum right now,
because I want to give some time for
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, this is a global market,
60 countries and then some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're here in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're operating in Germany or France or
Italy, what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to think about the global
aspect of this and adjust accordingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you act local, you have to think
global.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you'll be left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's this tremendous opportunity
that you want to take advantage of right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, thank you very much for
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take a few questions if there are
any.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Bo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Bo.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have time for one or two quick
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please be brief.
[SPEAKER_02]: No rambling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to catch up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we started a little late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you say hungover in German?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for taking my question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, there's been some anecdotal
evidence, fairly convincing but still
[SPEAKER_01]: anecdotal, that people have been rejecting
what they perceive as poor quality
[SPEAKER_01]: government weed and staying with their
supplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see that the black market presents
any challenges at this point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or has that ship sailed?
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I view the illicit market
relative to legal market is not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily on quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based upon price.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done elasticity analysis,
which means pricing sensitivity by the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the data is very convincing that
consumers don't want to pay too much of a
[SPEAKER_00]: premium to do things legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, if they're taxed too much,
if there's too much of a price mark,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll just revert back to the illicit
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with respect to Canada, what's
occurring there is that due to supply
[SPEAKER_00]: shortages and the lack of access at the
retail level, there's not enough supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so prices are high, especially with a
$1 per gram tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just to ask mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it's doing is it's driving the
behavior of the consumer back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: illicit market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once prices commoditize and lower,
and they're more price competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to the illicit market,
then you'll see more market conversions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumer conversion, I've modeled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super easy to predict, and it's all
based upon price.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it one more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bo Whitney, the VP from New Frontier Data.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very informative, and we really
appreciate you, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming.
