[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Alex Rogers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the founder of the ICBC and I want to
give my heartfelt thanks to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here for business and business I
found out the more you perpetuate the
[SPEAKER_02]: business, the more you perpetuate the
politics and move the public policy
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're here to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm so happy to be here at the ICBC
and having Wobba as a platform to be
[SPEAKER_00]: connected with all the key players in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a really good place to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ICBC is a very important event and
conference for the European industry to
[SPEAKER_01]: build its identity, ask questions itself,
develop a professional community of people
[SPEAKER_01]: who are invested and engaged in the
emerging European cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very unique space in terms of being
able to connect with people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: working in very diverse parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the networking potential of the
ICBC is very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, it brings a very diverse range
of people together from operations,
[SPEAKER_01]: branding, people who are actually side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a very short space of time,
we can cover a lot of ground in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: different roles, viewpoints, people
involved in the European space and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the networking element of the ICBC is
very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would love to
[SPEAKER_00]: come back again and we are really looking
forward to go as well to Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would love to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
