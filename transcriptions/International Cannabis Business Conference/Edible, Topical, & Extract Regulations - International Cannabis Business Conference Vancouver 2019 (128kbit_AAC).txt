[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to Alex and ICBC.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be an exciting and
exceptional panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a bunch of really talented,
smart folks coming onto the stage right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Immediately to my right is Emma Andrews.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is the Chief Commercial Officer of
BevKana Enterprises, Inc.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to her right is Bert Hink.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is the President of Rising Tide
Consultants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next on the line there is Neil Morota.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the President and CEO, Director and
Founder of Indiva, one of the sponsors of
[SPEAKER_03]: the boat cruise tonight, so thanks very
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to his right is Brandon Wright.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Wright is the CEO of Dynaleo,
a new entrant in the edible space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very excited to have everybody here
today and thank you all for coming to ICBC
[SPEAKER_03]: and attending this wonderful conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my name is Kirk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to be a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the cannabis space, I had the great
good fortune of representing Owen Smith in
[SPEAKER_03]: a case that arose out of a bust.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was baking cookies for the Vancouver
Cannabis Buyers Club of Canada,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the first compassion clubs in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he unfortunately ran into problems
with the authorities because at the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: not only were compassion clubs illegal,
but the medical cannabis system did not
[SPEAKER_03]: allow for anyone to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: In any way, other than dried flowers,
essentially, couldn't have derivative
[SPEAKER_03]: products.
[SPEAKER_03]: A panel like this one would have been sort
of a distant dream back then in 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we took a challenge on behalf of
the club and Owen, all the way to the
[SPEAKER_03]: Supreme Court of Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: We won at the trial court level.
[SPEAKER_03]: We won at the court of appeal level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm pleased that we won unanimously in
the Supreme Court of Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the restrictions to dried cannabis
only were stricken.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that but for Owen's work and
the witnesses in that case, none of us
[SPEAKER_03]: would be up here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I salute him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that the club continues to
operate outside of the regulatory scheme.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's trying to do its best for its
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard a lot earlier about the
possibilities of challenges,
[SPEAKER_03]: constitutional challenges, to come for Mr.
Conroy and in bringing access to the full
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum of derivative products to medical
cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that work continues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's important and vital work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we need to pay homage to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're here to talk about changes that
are coming in just a few short days,
[SPEAKER_03]: really.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a new regulatory environment
coming for derivative cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not talking about new products,
but we are talking about new rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And many have suggested that perhaps there
are too many rules or those rules are too
[SPEAKER_03]: restrictive.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was alluded to in the prior panel and
the possibility of a constitutional
[SPEAKER_03]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're going to try to divide this
panel into three topics and get through
[SPEAKER_03]: those topics in a manner that allows us to
answer some questions towards the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we don't do that, grab any one of us
out in the hallway.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all happy to chat later and
throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to talk about safety and
compliance.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about the rollout
that's coming over the next few months of
[SPEAKER_03]: these new products and educating consumers
and regulators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're going to talk about the
challenges and opportunities that are
[SPEAKER_03]: posed for branding and marketing for
companies in this space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's start with safety and compliance
and the rule set so we understand,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what are the rules of the road?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the rules of the game?
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard earlier that there is a somewhat
say fairly low limit on the amount of THC
[SPEAKER_03]: or CBD that can be in packaged good,
edible products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also some marketing
restrictions that are in place and child
[SPEAKER_03]: safety restrictions that are in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll start off at the far end with
Brandon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us sort of an overview of what are
the rule sets?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the biggest challenges posed as
industry moves into this space?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Kirk.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think last panel we heard everyone
talking about the 10 milligram THC limit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously that's going to be a big
one.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going to solve the problem for
medical consumers up front.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to have to work hard to
push back against that and see what we can
[SPEAKER_08]: do to make it available for medical
consumers.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the one piece of the rules that I do
really like is so far they proposed an
[SPEAKER_08]: unlimited limit on CBD content.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that CBD is the next big thing
coming up.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that it has tremendous medical
efficacy in many areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the ability for unlimited product
formats in that category is really what
[SPEAKER_08]: excites us a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It allows for just so much more dynamic
products and so much more availability.
[SPEAKER_08]: As well, we've seen recent regulations or
proposed regulations released in the CHP
[SPEAKER_08]: product, which is going to be a
combination of CBD and natural health
[SPEAKER_08]: product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, it's still going to contain
cannabis, so it's still going to have to
[SPEAKER_08]: be distributed through the provinces and
through the normal cannabis channels.
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, opening up a lot more product
categories and a lot more options.
[SPEAKER_03]: This field, as we heard in the last panel,
is regulated at multiple levels of
[SPEAKER_03]: government.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, Bert, I'll ask you, because you do
have experience in provincial regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: policy, how are the various provincial
governments going to help ensure that
[SPEAKER_03]: edibles, for example, are of sufficient
quality and have accurate measurements of
[SPEAKER_03]: THC and CBD, and are also free of
chemicals and possible contaminants,
[SPEAKER_03]: such as pesticides, from the plants that
are grown to make these value-added
[SPEAKER_03]: products?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a bit of a misfit on this panel,
because I come from 30 years of government
[SPEAKER_04]: regulation, and first of all, running the
cabinet secretariat for Premier Bill
[SPEAKER_04]: Bennett, and then I was general manager of
the Liquor Control Licensing Branch for
[SPEAKER_04]: several years, and the last 30 years,
consulting in liquor licensing.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the rollout of cannabis came about,
we got involved with it, mainly because we
[SPEAKER_04]: felt that we saw what was going to happen
was going to be the same regulators that
[SPEAKER_04]: regulate liquor are going to be regulating
cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same process, same approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from my perspective on this topic is a
lot of work still needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: During the last several years,
I've gone to a lot of cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: conferences, and there aren't a lot of
people here at these conferences from
[SPEAKER_04]: government.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if there's anybody here from
the liquor branch, or liquor cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: branch, or if there's anyone here from the
cannabis distribution branch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if they're willing to show it.
What's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if they're willing to show it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and we find that there's a lack of
dialogue between the people in the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, and you folks who have been in
the industry of the last umpteen years are
[SPEAKER_04]: to cannabis what NASA is to space.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's going on, and what we find
that there's a lack of a dialogue,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have government making rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I was in government, we used to
have this saying, which was don't start
[SPEAKER_04]: vast plans with half vast ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we often find that sometimes things
are rolled out in government, and they
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't consider all the consequences,
or what we would call the unintended
[SPEAKER_04]: consequences.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm concerned about here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There needs to be more dialogue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to see that the industry is
starting to get motivated and organized,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was on the previous panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's working hard to create Acres
Association of Cannabis Retailers to lobby
[SPEAKER_04]: the government, but that's the way it's
gonna have to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now with respect to the issue of quality,
it's a huge issue now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had one client who went to the
government cannabis store here and bought
[SPEAKER_04]: eight products.
[SPEAKER_04]: He took them to an independent lab to have
them tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: One product came back positive for
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only one product was accurate in terms of
what it was labeled.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the other remaining six had the wrong
THC levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you bring it into the world of
edibles, that's gonna be a huge factor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other problem we have right now on
the liquor side is filling the pipeline
[SPEAKER_04]: with product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you might have heard that the BC
government appointed an independent review
[SPEAKER_04]: of the distribution system for liquor
because the private liquor store industry
[SPEAKER_04]: and restaurants have been complaining that
they're getting cross-stocked shortages.
[SPEAKER_04]: The product they order, like a new scotch
release or something like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: or wine release, they don't get it or they
only get half of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can see that happening with edibles,
filling the demand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the uptake for edibles is
gonna be huge, particularly with older
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And can they provide the product safely,
quickly, with a shelf life to the
[SPEAKER_04]: retailers that is accurate in terms of its
chemical composition or its quality?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, to me, is huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like to see more dialogue with
industry on this point.
[SPEAKER_08]: So actually, Kirk, I wanna jump in on two
points there.
[SPEAKER_08]: First, there was a recent study done on
about 1,500 people that showed of the four
[SPEAKER_08]: million cannabis users in Canada,
the new regulations and edibles and vapes
[SPEAKER_08]: and so forth would add an additional three
million users.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are definitely gonna see a new crowd
jumping in.
[SPEAKER_08]: The second point I wanted to add was on
the topic of quality control and industry
[SPEAKER_08]: associations.
[SPEAKER_08]: More recently, there was a conference that
was called the C45 conference that was
[SPEAKER_08]: specific to upholding the standards of
production of various things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And edibles was a big topic at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: The idea behind it is an industry
association that advocates for high
[SPEAKER_08]: quality products, advocates for production
standards, and that we specifically
[SPEAKER_08]: recommended that they advocate for lab
testing standards that are standard across
[SPEAKER_08]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been lab testing edibles now for
almost four years, and it's obvious that
[SPEAKER_08]: not everybody does it the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a huge problem in the industry
for consistency.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're not getting the same testing done
on one end of the country that we are at
[SPEAKER_08]: the other, we're gonna have a problem
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the products that are coming online
aren't new products, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people make gummies, people make
edible products, people make cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's new, at least in the regulated
framework, is that they now are gonna have
[SPEAKER_03]: THC, CBD, and other cannabinoids in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, Neil, I think, let's come to you
and I'll ask you, these consumer packaged
[SPEAKER_03]: goods, these kinds of things that are
already being sold, is there utility in
[SPEAKER_03]: having that kind of deep CPG experience
come from other realms and come into the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry and help build that sort
of safe, trusted, reliable model?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, yeah, we certainly think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's been a big part of our strategy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's say, looking at senior
management, how we've added to the team
[SPEAKER_06]: aggressively in the last 12 to 18 months.
[SPEAKER_06]: As we've built out partnerships in the
edible space, like Bang and like Ruby
[SPEAKER_06]: Sugar.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've drawn on, we're in London,
Ontario, which is a terrific market with a
[SPEAKER_06]: rich history of not only agriculture,
but also food manufacturing and
[SPEAKER_06]: processing, as well as manufacturing of
all kinds of other products.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a terrific labor force.
[SPEAKER_06]: London's not a huge city, but there's over
half a million people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would say a disproportionate amount
of skilled labor relative to the size of
[SPEAKER_06]: the city.
[SPEAKER_06]: So absolutely we're working we're adding
in that area intentionally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our VP of operations has 25 years of
experience working with companies like
[SPEAKER_06]: Clorox and General Mills, Maple Leaf
Foods, B&G.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our director of ops was at Nestle for well
over a decade.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we continue to draw people from other
CPG companies like Pepsi, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a huge part of addressing,
I think, what Bert just brought up,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is how do you create a consistent
quality product that lives within the regs
[SPEAKER_06]: and doesn't test negative for pesticides,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's hugely important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Circling back on safety and this 10
milligram maximum THC per package that's
[SPEAKER_03]: being implemented by Health Canada,
Emma, what do you think that cap on the
[SPEAKER_03]: potency of your products has in terms of
defining who the consumers are that will
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually purchase those products at the
point of retail?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a different thing entirely than,
for example, a medical consumer base?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how are other jurisdictions regulating
in this area?
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard from Laurie Ajax earlier about
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we doing vis-a-vis a market
that's about the same size as Canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: 35 million or so people that's coming
online at about the same time as Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we stack up?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really a new consumer category.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think anyone who is an avid consumer
in the audience would testify to this,
[SPEAKER_05]: that a 10 milligram limit may not be
enough if you are a high tolerance
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in terms of your customer segmentation,
I think for these infused products,
[SPEAKER_05]: you really are targeting the canicurious,
the novice consumer, means there's a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of due diligence in terms of pairing
education with your product concepts as
[SPEAKER_05]: well and really advocating for safe and
responsible consumption if this is gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: be someone's first experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think also by nature of the product
format, it's non-combustible, it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: smokeable, so it's very approachable to a
wider segment of consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we compare this to looking down at
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: marketplace in California specifically,
there's a 100 milligram potency for a
[SPEAKER_05]: beverage as an example, as the upper
limit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the consumer that's drawn towards that
product is perhaps from the legacy market
[SPEAKER_05]: or a higher tolerance consumer.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're what's currently going into the
dispensaries demanding these products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the dispensaries in California
haven't been as open to carrying a wide
[SPEAKER_05]: selection of the lower potency drinks
because they're thinking the consumer's
[SPEAKER_05]: not there yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But those products at that type of potency
are really to draw in the new consumer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's the brand's responsibility to make
sure they're building awareness outside of
[SPEAKER_05]: retail to drive that consumer in store to
know that there's a product format and a
[SPEAKER_05]: potency that's appropriate for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think for Bevcana, that's really been
the focus is looking at the new consumer,
[SPEAKER_05]: what are their aptitudes and motivations,
and pairing products that are 10
[SPEAKER_05]: milligrams and less.
[SPEAKER_05]: So starting at potentially a micro dose,
two and a half milligrams in different
[SPEAKER_05]: ranges.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think too as a manufacturer,
that's obviously an advantage to get
[SPEAKER_05]: people to consume more of your product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're creating too high of a
potency, it doesn't really leave a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: room for multiple consumption occasions,
potentially within a day or potentially
[SPEAKER_05]: within any given purchase.
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely think this is a new consumer
category with that type of potency limit.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, the 10 milligram limit is like
light beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna, to me, ensure the continuation
of what I call the $100 on the barbecue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a friend, she's got Crohn's
disease, and every Friday, she and her
[SPEAKER_04]: husband place a $100 in an envelope and
put it on the barbecue.
[SPEAKER_04]: They come home that night, the $100 is
gone, and there's a little bag there
[SPEAKER_04]: because it helps her with a Crohn's
disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: The 10 milligram is not enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: All this is gonna do is make a lot of fat
people, and it's gonna hurt the consumer
[SPEAKER_04]: because imagine how many brownies you're
gonna have to have to get the right THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's something that after we
visit, it reminded me also years ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: the BC government brought in a minimum
drink price for alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they got protests from the legions and
veterans clubs because they set the drink
[SPEAKER_04]: price too high.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't consult.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had to go back and lower it to get
it so that when you went into a legion,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is one they have to go back
and rethink.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love to add a little anecdote to that
as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the past, when we first entered the
market about four years ago, for anyone
[SPEAKER_08]: who doesn't know my background,
my last company was called Baked Edibles,
[SPEAKER_08]: recently purchased by Pasha Brands.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we first entered the market,
it was all high dose stuff, all of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And everyone who was in the market was an
educated consumer.
[SPEAKER_08]: They knew exactly what they were looking
for.
[SPEAKER_08]: They often knew what potency they were
looking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the majority of the products that we
sold, we sold over 50 SKUs, were on the
[SPEAKER_08]: higher end of the range.
[SPEAKER_08]: At some point after about a year and a
half, we started introducing low dose
[SPEAKER_08]: products because there were new consumers
entering the market who wanted these
[SPEAKER_08]: products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, in the first year,
it looked like this, one giant hump of
[SPEAKER_08]: high dose products.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're talking like 200 and 400
milligram brownies as our number one
[SPEAKER_08]: selling product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Soon, after about a year and a half,
and ultimately over the course of the next
[SPEAKER_08]: three years, as we added these lower dose
products, like a five milligram gummy,
[SPEAKER_08]: I kid you not, it is literally the
opposite end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where the other giant hump of
consumers started coming in.
[SPEAKER_08]: The middle areas were so-so, but without a
doubt, the potency at the high end was
[SPEAKER_08]: huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's a huge segment of customers
who are gonna be left behind, who are
[SPEAKER_08]: gonna remain in the legacy market as long
as they can, because that's where they'll
[SPEAKER_08]: find the products until we see a solution
that's appropriate to transitioning them
[SPEAKER_08]: into the legal market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just add one thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I've prefaced everything I'm about
to say by I think it makes sense to have
[SPEAKER_06]: two tracks, one for medical and one for
rec, where a medical patient could order a
[SPEAKER_06]: higher dose product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had family members that we're dosing
with are so fighting cancer, we're taking
[SPEAKER_06]: hundreds of milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a totally different sport,
it's not the same conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I agree completely with Brandon,
there is this barbell, we've got the
[SPEAKER_06]: really high dose, let's say folks that
have built up a big tolerance,
[SPEAKER_06]: and 10 or 20 milligrams, which by the way,
is still the cheapest date in town for a
[SPEAKER_06]: novice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if you spend 10 bucks and buy
let's say two chocolates, and you've got a
[SPEAKER_06]: total of 20 milligrams, that's a lot for
someone that's new to trying edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think what we don't want is to
create really bad experiences for new
[SPEAKER_06]: users.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna get a lot of pushback,
and it's gonna go right up to the
[SPEAKER_06]: government really quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've tried to at least embrace,
I mean, you'll beat your head in
[SPEAKER_06]: complaining about government rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing I would say is we're still
very thankful that we're the first G7
[SPEAKER_06]: country to have legalized recreationally.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is still version 1.0.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's room, let's say,
in time to change and allow for higher
[SPEAKER_03]: doses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think they did underscore in the
last panel, and I noted as well in Miss
[SPEAKER_03]: Ajax's discussion earlier that California
has chosen to have separate tracks for
[SPEAKER_03]: medical and non-medical consumers,
adult use consumers versus medical
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems to me that our federal
government here has in some respects
[SPEAKER_03]: abdicated their responsibility to medical
consumers in this legalization 2.0 that
[SPEAKER_03]: are rolling out derivative products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's somewhat personal to me,
because I spent a lot of time litigating
[SPEAKER_03]: this issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the brave people that came and
testified in the Smith case, and Mr. Smith
[SPEAKER_03]: himself, we did a lot of work to ensure
that patients had access to derivative
[SPEAKER_03]: products, period.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it feels like some of that is being
undone with these potency limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though myself, as a 35 year cannabis
consumer, I'm not taking a 400 milligram
[SPEAKER_03]: brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just no chance that that's ever
occurring.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the low dose consumer, despite the
fact that I have high tolerance when I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Different strokes for different smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with the 10 milligrams as a dose.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't necessarily agree with it being
limited to one package.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a hugely undue burden on industry,
undue on consumers, on the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're all on the same page there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do have the rules, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have been written.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was opportunity for public comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Comments were given.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some were heated, some were not heated.
[SPEAKER_03]: That particular one, I think, was the
decision that was made to go conservative
[SPEAKER_03]: early versus more liberal early.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we have a rollout.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're mid-September here.
[SPEAKER_03]: October 17 is legalization 2.0 in terms of
these products being theoretically able to
[SPEAKER_03]: come online.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it may not feel like things are
happening quickly to people that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: in the industry living and breathing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I talk to bureaucrats,
they think things are moving at the speed
[SPEAKER_03]: of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a real difference between
people that are living and breathing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis in the industry side and people
that write rules and change legislation
[SPEAKER_03]: for a living.
[SPEAKER_03]: Industry's got to be nimble.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk a little bit about this rollout
that's coming in the next 90 days from
[SPEAKER_03]: both the industry and consumer
perspectives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Emma, there's this thing that people talk
about in industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the first to market.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get there first.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have an opportunity to potentially
gain early market share and dominate the
[SPEAKER_03]: category.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does the regulatory scheme that's in
place currently pose challenges to
[SPEAKER_03]: processors and manufacturers like Bevcana
looking to get that early mover advantage?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if anyone's aware, there's a
regulation that exists that the facility
[SPEAKER_05]: must be fully built and established before
you are in the ability to receive your
[SPEAKER_05]: license.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this really positions people that have
existing manufacturing expertise ahead of
[SPEAKER_05]: the curve.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ability to scale up to
commercialization and optimize your
[SPEAKER_05]: production practices to accommodate things
like childproof lids, to accommodate
[SPEAKER_05]: applying the excise stamp, to accommodate
labeling lot code and potency per batch
[SPEAKER_05]: along your production line.
[SPEAKER_05]: These aren't easy learning curves to go
through if you haven't worked on an
[SPEAKER_05]: existing bottling plant or an existing
manufacturing line before.
[SPEAKER_05]: So while that is a hindrance maybe to new
market entrance, it's an advantage to
[SPEAKER_05]: those that have an existing expertise
within manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll see a lot of early market
entrants that have that expertise in the
[SPEAKER_05]: background, whether that's Constellation
Brands, whether that's the Molson Coors
[SPEAKER_05]: Hexo collaboration, or whether that's up
and comers like Bevcana that are making
[SPEAKER_05]: use of an existing manufacturing facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: Based in a Soyuz actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think there's a big learning curve
to go through and so that's been causing
[SPEAKER_05]: some headaches obviously as we work
through implementing things like the
[SPEAKER_05]: childproof lids, the per package
stipulations, but then also getting your
[SPEAKER_05]: facility modified in order to meet the
security requirements for your processing
[SPEAKER_05]: license.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that early mover advantage I think is
only an advantage if you have an existing
[SPEAKER_05]: asset or infrastructure that you're taking
advantage of.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as many of us probably know it,
it won't be December until the beginning
[SPEAKER_05]: products start to appear in market,
but I think this is really a 2020 rollout.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that early mover advantage could
actually be Q4 of 2020.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's still a wide open market to
seize here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's tease that out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to me that when we saw the
transition from, in the cultivation side
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, we saw a lot of existing
greenhouses convert from green pepper
[SPEAKER_03]: production for example to cannabis
production, which gets you a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: an advantage versus building a purpose
built facility that takes a substantial
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of time to complete.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to me that if you've got a food
manufacturing plant and you're making
[SPEAKER_03]: brownies already and they're moderately
successful, maybe you just bring in the
[SPEAKER_03]: THC and CBD and run a couple extra shifts
and infuse your already existing products
[SPEAKER_03]: in your existing plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brandon, is that a feasible path to
market?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say it's a lot more difficult in this
industry than it is in the traditional
[SPEAKER_08]: food manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you who can probably imagine
what the life of an entrepreneur would
[SPEAKER_08]: look like in traditional food
manufacturing, you probably start with a
[SPEAKER_08]: farm stand, a couple of good products out
of your home kitchen, you sell locally,
[SPEAKER_08]: you scale up, you scale up, you scale up
and suddenly you get there.
[SPEAKER_08]: In this industry, good luck.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't sell any of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to have a million dollars and get
an LP.
[SPEAKER_08]: What that means is it's shutting out a
tremendous number of small players who
[SPEAKER_08]: would be producing these otherwise
incredible products and who could be
[SPEAKER_08]: coming into this market.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what it's doing is leaving folks like
us with the burden of taking on all those
[SPEAKER_08]: products.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're gonna see a real
dramatically slow inclusion of different
[SPEAKER_08]: products as it comes along.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of companies who've really
hesitated to take that risk into edibles
[SPEAKER_08]: right off the start.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of companies are starting with one
or two products, but without a doubt,
[SPEAKER_08]: selection and product quality and
everything else, it'll improve slowly over
[SPEAKER_08]: time as opposed to what it would have done
had we been able to shape this in the way
[SPEAKER_08]: that small entrepreneurs and small were
better off.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're better facilitated into coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those small entrepreneurs too,
I think, are forced into a different type
[SPEAKER_05]: of business equation because they have to
license or give up a little bit of their
[SPEAKER_05]: intellectual property and their equity in
that idea to somebody who would take their
[SPEAKER_05]: product to market under their own license.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it creates a lot of stifling,
I think, for those entrepreneurs that have
[SPEAKER_05]: the hustle and heart that deserve a go at
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no commissary kitchen model right
now for these products.
It's frustrating.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reality is that Health Canada made a
decision to not allow colocation with food
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have an existing food production
facility, you think, well, I can run my
[SPEAKER_03]: food production and then I can bring in
another shift and I can just infuse these
[SPEAKER_03]: products with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You simply can't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't with the cannabis ingredients.
[SPEAKER_05]: As an example, the packaging or the
bottles that Bevcana uses are made on a
[SPEAKER_05]: different side of the operation,
completely divided in separated buildings,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we can blow plastic on one side of the
operation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Essentially, it's a transaction sold into
the other side of the operation.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some ways to create
efficiencies, but certainly not within any
[SPEAKER_05]: of your ingredients or the production line
itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It literally is duplicating all of your
production capabilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was sitting in a meeting with the BC
Food Process Association about a year ago
[SPEAKER_08]: at this point when the regs were first
announced.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'd been holding meetings over the
course of the last two or three years and
[SPEAKER_08]: bringing in people from food and starting
to think, hey guys, start thinking about
[SPEAKER_08]: the edibles.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: In a room full of 60 people, most of whom
were involved in the food industry alone,
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was maybe me and Zenibus from
the cannabis side, and they announced the
[SPEAKER_08]: regulations and the despair in that room
was just palpable.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was crazy seeing how every single
company there was thinking, great,
[SPEAKER_08]: we get to use this excess capacity that
we've already built out on our cookie
[SPEAKER_08]: line, on our brownie line, on our snack
bar line, and then suddenly dreams were
[SPEAKER_08]: shattered and they realized it was an
entirely new business that they would have
[SPEAKER_08]: to build and partner with someone who is
experienced from the industry if just the
[SPEAKER_08]: burden became imaginably high.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are rollout issues on the industry
side, but there's a positive coming too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Brandon referenced earlier that
there's some data suggesting that there's
[SPEAKER_03]: up to three million new consumers that are
waiting to enter this space and become
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis consumers, but that stay away
from consuming cannabis currently because
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't want to smoke or vape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neil, what do you think this suggests both
in terms of the need for education of
[SPEAKER_03]: those new consumers, but also the cultural
shifts that's happening when millions of
[SPEAKER_03]: new people begin to consume cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, education is hugely important,
so we're very proactive about publishing
[SPEAKER_06]: things on our website and through social
media, giving people advice about,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what start low and go slow
means.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've sort of started saying try some and
then wait till tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no reason for anyone to have a bad
experience unless they have no coaching on
[SPEAKER_06]: how to go about trying an edible,
and that just relates I think primarily to
[SPEAKER_06]: milligrams and what you're dosing,
partly what you're eating as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: A chocolate might kick in a little
differently, given the cocoa butter is a
[SPEAKER_06]: great conduit versus gel cap or another
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Education goes a long way, but what we've
tried to do also in the spirit of that
[SPEAKER_06]: education is not just bring a marriage of
say chocolate and distillate, that's nice,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we partnered with Bang intentionally
through our joint venture in Canada where
[SPEAKER_06]: we have the exclusive right to produce and
sell those products across the country and
[SPEAKER_06]: export from Canada because that's a
cannabis brand, and so there's brand value
[SPEAKER_06]: there, important brand value and trust,
but also this is not a science experiment,
[SPEAKER_06]: these products already exist in the market
in California, they've moved into Nevada
[SPEAKER_06]: now and Florida, so to us that's the
essence of global branding, where someone
[SPEAKER_06]: can go buy a Bang chocolate, let's say at
the Honey Pot in Toronto or at one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: dispensaries in Vancouver, and it will be
the same chocolate and the same recipe if
[SPEAKER_06]: you went to Med Men in Venice Beach or
something let's say, or in San Diego or
[SPEAKER_06]: San Francisco, you'll find the same
products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Might be a little different dosing,
will absolutely be different packaging,
[SPEAKER_06]: there'll be French on it in Canada for
starters, but to us that is hugely
[SPEAKER_06]: important.
[SPEAKER_06]: The same thing with Ruby, the cannabis
sugar and salts that they make are sold in
[SPEAKER_06]: Washington state now, it's a much younger
company than Bang, but interesting
[SPEAKER_06]: disruptive product that are cannabis
brands and cannabis products to begin
[SPEAKER_06]: with.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the most important pieces
of education too is actually the feedback
[SPEAKER_05]: loop for the consumer, so products that
are made with water soluble technology
[SPEAKER_05]: means that there's a quicker onset,
so the consumer's better able to regulate
[SPEAKER_05]: their experience dose and outcomes based
on that quicker feedback loop than
[SPEAKER_05]: something that's a fat based edible,
that might be a homemade brownie where
[SPEAKER_05]: we've all had those experiences in the
past where it's so variable, depending on
[SPEAKER_05]: your own endocannabinoid system,
depending on the dose that you ate,
[SPEAKER_05]: depending on what part of the brownie tray
it was from, so this homogeneity that's
[SPEAKER_05]: required as part of our regulations
requires a technology advantage like a
[SPEAKER_05]: water soluble extract, so that gives you
that quicker feedback loop, so the
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer has more instantaneous awareness
about what their experience is about to be
[SPEAKER_05]: and will be over the subsequent few hours,
so you may not have to wait till the next
[SPEAKER_05]: morning, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You might have that feedback or should
have that feedback within let's say less
[SPEAKER_05]: than 15 minutes is kind of the common
standard with water soluble extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Bert, there's this pent up demand we're
hearing about for these different
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties of products and legalization 2.0
is scheduled to come online October 17 and
[SPEAKER_03]: these products will be legal technically
for commercial sale at that point,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course you can make them at home
currently now if you want to, but they'll
[SPEAKER_03]: be legal for sale on October 17.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean we have products on the
shelves on October 18 or is there some
[SPEAKER_03]: obstacles in the way to actually seeing
products and if so, when do you expect
[SPEAKER_03]: that to actually roll out and you can go
to your store and buy a cannabis infused
[SPEAKER_03]: chocolate?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'll go the same way as the
retail cannabis stores have gone,
[SPEAKER_04]: the slow rollout, adding it on.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we got into licensing retail stores,
we were surprised how long the application
[SPEAKER_04]: process takes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did last fall, about a year ago now,
we did an application for one of our
[SPEAKER_04]: liquor clients for a liquor store,
a pub up on Main Street and this is an
[SPEAKER_04]: experience licensee and his application
was about half an inch, three quarters of
[SPEAKER_04]: an inch thick for a liquor primary
license.
[SPEAKER_04]: During the same time, this gentleman
decided to get into the world of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we put in a cannabis retail store
application and it was 15 inches high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same person, same business, but it's 15
inches.
[SPEAKER_04]: That application took a long time to get
through the process and we've had people
[SPEAKER_04]: that we were working with about a year ago
who are still waiting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now some of it is the fault of the
applicants, but it's a very slow process
[SPEAKER_04]: going through the government.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're finding is that there are not
enough stores out there now to even serve
[SPEAKER_04]: the demand for cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people between the provincial
regulations and the municipalities are
[SPEAKER_04]: really delayed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think with the coming out of edibles,
I think it'll be a slow process to get
[SPEAKER_04]: them into the stores and again,
what the process right now is gonna do is
[SPEAKER_04]: give a huge advantage to the BC government
cannabis stores or the government cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: stores over the private stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also comes back to my supply issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second thing I think it'll do is prop
up the black market even further.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such a disincentive to the consumer
because most people that we talk to are
[SPEAKER_04]: really anxious to get into edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want to vape, they don't want
to smoke, but they would consume an
[SPEAKER_04]: edible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's a huge demand for it,
but I don't think the pipeline's gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: full right at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I think it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look at what's going on in edibles,
similar to what happened in craft beer and
[SPEAKER_04]: now refreshment beverages in the liquor
stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a plethora of refreshment
beverages in the liquor stores and Mike's
[SPEAKER_04]: Hard Lemonade came along and then after
that, there's an explosion of refreshment
[SPEAKER_04]: beverages and I think the same thing will
happen with edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it'll be a really innovative,
creative stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That innovation and that creativity
hopefully will translate into a wide
[SPEAKER_03]: variety of projects and products that
consumers appreciate and can come back to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you did mention, Bert, that there's
this sort of elephant in the room which is
[SPEAKER_03]: the fact that these products aren't really
new.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all for sale currently in Canada
right now in the legacy marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not easy to market your products.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not easy to brand your products when
you do it legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got sort of big stop signs and
small brand elements.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go into your local liquor store and
the craft beer industry has a wide variety
[SPEAKER_03]: of really interesting packaging options
available to them, some that might even be
[SPEAKER_03]: attractive to children, placed right at
child level on the shelves in the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Emma, with those tight restrictions on
branding and marketing, what opportunities
[SPEAKER_03]: are there for brands to carve out consumer
awareness so that people come and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, actually that product's available at
the legal dispenser?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been working in product
development for over a decade now in the
[SPEAKER_05]: natural products industry prior to working
in cannabis and I'm trained as a
[SPEAKER_05]: nutritionist as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this might be a little bit of a bias,
but I think with as much restriction as
[SPEAKER_05]: there is on packaging, when a consumer
approaches the shelf, there's very limited
[SPEAKER_05]: touch points for them to make their
product decision based off of.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the things I think is really
going to shine, especially in the onset of
[SPEAKER_05]: this category, perhaps before regulations
change, is how clean are your ingredients?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if a consumer is able to be appealed by
maybe the color of the package or the
[SPEAKER_05]: method of consumption itself, they're
interested in beverages, to pick up that
[SPEAKER_05]: package, what they're basing their
decision off of is potency, for sure,
[SPEAKER_05]: price, of course, but then what's in that
product?
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there artificial colors?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there artificial sweeteners?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there sweeteners in general?
[SPEAKER_05]: So for Vibkana, we've been really looking
at clean ingredient label, minimal
[SPEAKER_05]: ingredients, no added sugars, no
artificial colors, so nothing that would
[SPEAKER_05]: cause for concern, alarm, everything
that's all natural.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's a huge opportunity for
brands and manufacturers is to formulate
[SPEAKER_05]: with a higher quality standard so that
there's nothing offensive making somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: put that product back on shelf.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then ultimately, I think efficacy is a
big part of the marketing play.
[SPEAKER_05]: If your product delivers on the occasion
that you're seeking, so something that's a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit euphoric, as an example,
or something that helps you relax and
[SPEAKER_05]: unwind at the end of the day, these
occasion-based types of outcomes,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a big appeal in terms of
somebody repeat purchasing or recommending
[SPEAKER_05]: that product or referring that product to
others in their network.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in some cases, this comes back to
grassroots marketing initiatives,
[SPEAKER_05]: word of mouth, and in other cases,
it comes back to the fundamentals of
[SPEAKER_05]: product development, which is what are
your ingredients and what's your quality
[SPEAKER_05]: standard when you're formulating?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the huge opportunity here,
especially at the beginning of this
[SPEAKER_05]: category.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think another big key of consumer
repetition on branding is just that
[SPEAKER_08]: repetition with so few touch points.
[SPEAKER_08]: The store is the place where they see your
brand first.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not on the shelf, they will
replace you with the product next to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think in the early rollouts,
we saw a lot of companies who brought
[SPEAKER_08]: products to market early.
[SPEAKER_08]: They had that first-mover advantage,
but they couldn't hold it because their
[SPEAKER_08]: products didn't remain on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know we're producing a high-volume
strategy of always trying to be there,
[SPEAKER_08]: no matter which brand we're producing for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's really important that the
consumer can go in, see your product,
[SPEAKER_08]: and buy it over and over and over and over
if it's the only place they're ever going
to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to see your product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited about Outdoor Grow coming
online because I think that will help keep
[SPEAKER_05]: these products in supply because the input
amount that you're using is so minimal if
[SPEAKER_05]: you're using refinement and purification
in your extraction process.
[SPEAKER_05]: But hopefully we won't see the same supply
issues as these categories come online.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that's a great point is the
replicability of seeing these brands and
[SPEAKER_05]: the visibility in the market.
[SPEAKER_08]: I strongly agree with the green labeling
as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going with natural fruit purees from
Okanagan Peaches and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got just about two or three
minutes left.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did want to save a little bit of time
for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to some questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd ask that you just ask the question,
ask it as succinctly as possible,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then in the answers, let's try to also
be as succinct as possible, get through as
[SPEAKER_03]: many as we can in the next two minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are nice words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear from the panel one more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gravity is the soul of wit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go here, then we'll go there,
and that'll be it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So at the very beginning of the panel,
you hit on quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: And testing of these products.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to me, this is a really interesting
issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought it was really interesting
that you can test stuff that's on the
[SPEAKER_07]: shelf and get very different answers as to
what's in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do you think the solution to that
problem is?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we going to go to some standardized or
validated testing process for this?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can jump in on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I think you have something to
add as well, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a variance that's actually
allowed on the label.
[SPEAKER_05]: So depending on the potency that you're
claiming, there's a different variance at
[SPEAKER_05]: different breaks along that potency
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what this means is a manufacturer could
produce the label in advance just for
[SPEAKER_05]: efficacy and efficiency in their costing
strategy.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as their label is testing within
that variance spec, they can release it
[SPEAKER_05]: into the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the due diligence is for the
manufacturer to label based on the batch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you get your testing data back,
to label it not just according to the
[SPEAKER_05]: variance that's allowed, but the actual
values that were achieved for that batch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that transparency ultimately,
I think, is going to shine through in the
[SPEAKER_05]: eyes of the consumer, even if the retailer
then has to do a little bit of explaining,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, why is this batch a little bit
different than the last batch?
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that's the ultimate
implication for manufacturers and
[SPEAKER_05]: processors is to label on a per batch
basis to overcome that variance.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's very little times when the
customer gets over the feeling of
[SPEAKER_08]: dishonesty.
[SPEAKER_08]: And especially when you're paying who
knows how many dollars per 10 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_08]: every milligram that's not in there is
hitting someone's wallet.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the other answer there, of course,
is industry associations and coming from
[SPEAKER_08]: within industry to standardized testing
across the provinces.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no push for it from government
right now because they've already handed
[SPEAKER_08]: out these testing licenses to the labs and
they assume that the labs are doing it at
[SPEAKER_08]: a high quality level.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they may well be.
[SPEAKER_08]: The difference is that they're not doing
it standardized with standardized
[SPEAKER_08]: processes across the level.
[SPEAKER_08]: We knew a lab that was taking an entire
brownie, breaking off a corner of it,
[SPEAKER_08]: blending that and getting a result.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not a homogenous sample.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a representative sample.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're hoping that not all labs in
Canada are doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, we need everyone to
be on the same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we in the industry and we
come from all sides, makers and investors,
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs, I think we have a
responsibility to find an international
[SPEAKER_00]: agency to develop testing standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in many countries in my investments
and I'm working on laboratories and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the European ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have high enough testing
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if we were the ones to propose
them and maybe go to the United Nations,
[SPEAKER_00]: to have them help us with these standards,
that could be accepted internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'd put ourselves in a much
better place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my thinking.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually disagree with the we don't have
high enough standards.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't think that they're consistent
enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think in Canada we have the highest
standards in the world for testing,
[SPEAKER_08]: especially on food products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's... Agreed.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to lead in this category globally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It certainly speaks to the need for coming
together and ushering in legalization 3.0,
[SPEAKER_03]: which hopefully will see the fall of the
international drug control treaties and
[SPEAKER_03]: more coordinated effort across
jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you all for your attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to ICBC for having us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over to you, Nugat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Kirk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it for Kirk and all the
fabulous panelists.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very informative.
