[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to move right along to
discuss cracking the International
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Logistics Chain Code,
the CEM of Cannibalog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Yoram Eshel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need some energy around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's late after lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who is here from Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is here from Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is here from Portugal?
[SPEAKER_01]: And who is here from Australia?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sleeping now.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good afternoon, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for staying.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we want to do today, what I want to
do today, is actually give you a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: practical advice, a lot of practical
things that you have to think about when
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to do international trade of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Import and export cannabis around the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what Cannibalog is doing,
and this is what I want to share with you,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we learned, and we learned a lot
during 2013, and what you should expect
[SPEAKER_01]: going forward in the coming years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm talking about logistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Logistics is sometimes something that you
think it's like moving by itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will learn a little bit about what
you should do, what you should be aware
[SPEAKER_01]: about, and how, actually, all those
presentations before, when we talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: all these opportunities, how we actually
execute that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my presentation, myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: 14 years I was the head of global supply
chain and logistics for Teva.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming from the pharma industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the industry in and out,
coming with all the experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: the knowledge, the understanding of
quality, pharmaceuticals, markets,
[SPEAKER_01]: 85 production sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I retired from Teva and decided to
come to this amazing industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry, and actually to
bring all my knowledge from the pharma
[SPEAKER_01]: into the medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why I made all those
connections, and this is why I'm here
[SPEAKER_01]: today to share with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: One slide about the company, Cannibalog.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already moved more than 80,000 kilos of
cannabis in the last two, three years from
[SPEAKER_01]: many countries to many countries I'll
share with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of operation, a lot of movement,
and 98% of what we do is moving cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products from one country to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a little bit in the distribution of
cannabis, but mainly in the international
[SPEAKER_01]: trade, and this is what I would like to
share with you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to walk it step by step.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see that I'll talk about all
those points during my presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's new?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was here last year, and I said,
what's new this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, we see that there are new
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know, you know Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will talk all day about Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also Greece, there is a big reform in
Israel, big change.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market is going to grow dramatically,
and I just want to encourage you to find
[SPEAKER_01]: out what are the opportunities out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big number of new EUGMP
facilities in Portugal, in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: in other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking for tolling,
if you want to sell your products in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe, there are more and more
opportunities doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing about Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry challenges here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see what's going on with big companies,
both in Canada and Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other places, companies are
disappearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big companies that made a lot of
investment are not there in the market
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be aware of those changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: New markets, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many markets, real markets of
cannabis, medical cannabis products,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are in the world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who thinks two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three?
[SPEAKER_01]: Four?
[SPEAKER_01]: Five?
[SPEAKER_01]: Raise your hand who thinks five?
[SPEAKER_01]: About five, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical cannabis markets, as such,
five markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of stories, a lot of,
you know, people think that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: countries are joining the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, doctors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Prescriptions, you go to a pharmacy and
you get your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody wants to sell to Germany,
to Australia, to the UK, to Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_01]: to Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, new import-export
opportunities in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, not just Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stories about many
countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will hear that there are imports from
Thailand or exports out of Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is no.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no clear regulations over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of gray issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to execution,
make sure that you do understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So logistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk about logistics,
you have to remember these five pillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the regulatory compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, with cannabis, there's no
or I would say differently, I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: that each country has its own regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever you do international trade of
cannabis, be aware that the exporting
[SPEAKER_01]: country regulations are not exactly as the
importing country regulations and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to adhere to both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So regulatory issues are mainly or
probably the main thing that you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: take care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Security.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's narcotics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's attracting a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Security.
[SPEAKER_01]: Security is an important point.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some countries that were not
moving even one flower or one leaf unless
[SPEAKER_01]: we have an armed guard together with a
truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's the regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we're just doing it even if it's
not the regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be aware of security.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality assurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly like pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical cannabis is exactly like any
molecule that you can think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about paracetamol or anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why you have to adhere to all
those pharmaceutical requirements,
[SPEAKER_01]: GDP, and other GMP regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expertise.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis, excuse my language, cannabis is
not garments from, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from a country.
[SPEAKER_01]: To ship cannabis, it's a highly regulated
issue and if you ship it and you don't do
[SPEAKER_01]: it right, you can kiss it goodbye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll say it several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you arrive to the country's destination
and you cannot clear it, no way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be destroyed and you will
have to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a regular thing that you just
send it to DHL or FedEx or whatever and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last thing is global.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the lecturer before me said act
local, think global.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to be there,
if you really want to be there,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to do international trade,
think global.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we had in 2013, these were the main
lanes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you before there are not that many
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the strongest exporting
country is Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we saw a lot of movements from South
Africa either to EU, UK and Australia,
[SPEAKER_01]: Portugal, Uruguay, and a lot of
intra-Europe movements of medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: within Europe from Portugal to Germany to
Switzerland to others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one of those lanes required a
completely different logistic solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will talk about that in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of charts that we saw today,
but you can see the potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia, look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to grow dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, numbers are numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to show you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trend that we are going to face more
and more and more sales in different
[SPEAKER_01]: markets which will require logistic
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, you have to move
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pick it up in the site and you
have to bring it to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you like it or not, you have to
move it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to move it right because if
it's not, it's not going to help nobody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk two slides about regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I can bring you...
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have bring here dozens of charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, look at Google, say cannabis legal
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will get a lot of charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for the legal status of cannabis
recreation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I'm putting it here is because
I want you to make sure that you
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that regulations are moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are changing every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every week we see some changes in
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: More countries, more changes in the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year it was Australia, this year it's
Germany, Greece, Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's moving target all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure that you don't stick with one
map, but you understand the changes that
[SPEAKER_01]: we see almost every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the previous presentations was when
someone showed a list of 12 countries in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe, Malta, Portugal, Germany,
UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who understands the regulatory environment
in Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Please raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legal, not legal, half legal, decriminal,
criminalized, criminalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another map of Europe, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe this one is right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like in the pharma world.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the pharma world, you come to Europe,
there's one rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: With cannabis, changing all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD or not, THC or not, above 0.2,
above 0.3, whatever, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Europe, it's actually different
countries in Europe, and each one of them
[SPEAKER_01]: is different than the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure that you do understand that
what you know today is not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: what will be right next week or next month
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the regulatory maze in Europe is a
maze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a maze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is the regulatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make it even nicer, you know that
according to the UN regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: if a country wants to legalize or actually
to approve import or export or consumption
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis, they have to create a local
agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each country has to create a local agency
to deal with the cannabis licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the UN rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you deal with the shipment,
let's say from Portugal to Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you have to adhere to the Portuguese
infrared rules, but you also have to
[SPEAKER_01]: adhere to the B-Farm rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to have license, import
license from B-Farm, and you have to have
[SPEAKER_01]: export license from InfraMed or any other
agency in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they delay the decision,
you don't understand why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it will take you a week to get
an import permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it will take you three weeks to
get it, and sometimes six weeks to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Health Canada, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to name a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember, if you want to move even one
leaf of cannabis, you have to deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: the country agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are many of them with different
rules, with different timelines,
[SPEAKER_01]: with different service levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's even not fun, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are setting the rules,
and we have to understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is cannabis products, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are dealing with a variety of
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics can be seeds, can be tissue
cultures, can be cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a logistic point of view,
to move cuttings, and we moved already
[SPEAKER_01]: dozens of thousands of cuttings,
great cuttings, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess you know that in most countries
in the world, they will not accept rooted
[SPEAKER_01]: clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will accept just unrooted clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is an unrooted clone?
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it will not meet water in three,
four days, it's dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all you have is three, four days to
bring it from the cultivation site to
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere, a laboratory or a site,
that can put them in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So logistically, you have to control from
the cuttings up to the delivery with a
[SPEAKER_01]: very tight timeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four days, it's dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, we have 100% success with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dried flowers, APIs, what I call APIs and
you will call extracts, completely
[SPEAKER_01]: different logistic solutions, completely
different way to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Packed, finished, semi-finished cannabis
products, herbal medicine, we heard a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they need temperature control?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they need any kind of control?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question, because some countries will
say yes, some countries will say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And smokable products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we really need to know from the
quality point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember, medical cannabis is a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem or the first problem you have
to think about, it's a plant-based
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not the tablet that you go to the
pharmacy and buy it, although there are
[SPEAKER_01]: tablets for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea that if you're moving
flowers, it's an agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like removing tomatoes, but you don't
have medicine tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anywhere you go, you have to adhere
both to the pharmaceutical side and also
[SPEAKER_01]: to the agricultural side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both authorities will be involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking flowers, always a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a plant-based medicine which
requires much more attention than just
[SPEAKER_01]: shipping either pharmaceuticals or
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second issue, of course you have to adhere
to the pharma standard, quality
[SPEAKER_01]: management, GDP, you know the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maintaining the product integrity,
safety, safe security, and of course
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature control.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put a data logger on the region and
the guy on the other side has to read it
[SPEAKER_01]: and there is a temperature excursion,
no way you can take it to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you go through certain procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to make sure that it's a
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make sure how to maintain the
temperature along the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: GDP applicable regulations, sometimes it's
country specifics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's general, sometimes it's
country specifics that you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Packages, I just brought you here a
picture of a palette, a nice palette
[SPEAKER_01]: covered with thermal covers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the only solution, there's
different solutions how you maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This palette goes or travels within a
temperature control truck, what we call
[SPEAKER_01]: TCV, temperature control truck,
with a thermal protection, there are a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of types of that, just to show you that it
has to be packed properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to put the data logger under
the thermal cover and not on top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: thermal cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you put it on top of the thermal
covers, you measure the outside
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't measure the inside or the
product temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why it's very, very important to
have a very strict packaging protocol and
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand how you protect those
products along the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this palette can travel 10,000 miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, how you protect it, how you make
sure that it's working properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last thing, it's a good advice for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are selling your product,
sell your products to a customer on the
[SPEAKER_01]: other side, make sure that you understand
their acceptance criteria, not yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their acceptance criteria, whether
laboratory tests, whether other tests,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have to adhere to their
acceptance or rejection criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know it in advance and you
don't bring the right COVAs or the right
[SPEAKER_01]: documents, they cannot clear it in their
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your market, it might be okay,
but in their market, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why make sure that when you
negotiate a deal, you understand those
[SPEAKER_01]: criteria and you make sure that you can
adhere to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw too many cases where it was not
aligned and it creates a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes it's not about the price,
it's not about the quality, it's not about
[SPEAKER_01]: the size of the flowers or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's just laboratory tests,
heavy metals or whatever the case is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very schematic chart,
how we ship cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, how we ship medical products
anyhow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pick it with a temperature control
truck, we take it to the airline,
[SPEAKER_01]: we take it to the airport, we have special
measures at the airport, we use special
[SPEAKER_01]: service with the airlines and on and on
and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you want to talk about on-time
delivery?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to plan it very, very carefully
and I'll talk about it a bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow, I don't know why, a lot of cases
in this industry is like you're waiting
[SPEAKER_01]: five days before the expiry of the permit
and then you ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why cannot do it months before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why to be under pressure?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you can understand that sometimes
there will be delays, there will be
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, customs or whatever, and then you
are very close to the expiry of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of your license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes time and if you want to meet a
deadline, you have to plan it carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Security.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see there are special vehicles to
maintain security.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told you already that in some cases,
some countries were not moving it without
[SPEAKER_01]: an armed guard, whether in the truck or
following the truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, GPS, you know, you're fencing
all those solutions but make sure that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good insurance coverage because
sometimes things may happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, most of the things we
didn't have even one case of theft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it is damages or temperature
excursion or things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure that your insurance cover
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We provide special insurance policy for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you have such.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit more than just regular
pharmaceuticals but you better have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Operation challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can talk about until the evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, exploitation procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some countries, like for instance,
Canada, you have to be registered as an
[SPEAKER_01]: exporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found cases where we already
collected the goods and the guy was not
[SPEAKER_01]: registered as an exporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, it's two minutes on the
computer but you have to do it once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you have to register yourself with the
Ministry of Agriculture authority,
[SPEAKER_01]: local.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, exploitation should be
simple but sometimes the procedure are
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they want to examine it,
sometimes they want to test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, if it's within the EU,
it's relatively easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of it, if it's coming from
Canada, Australia, a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Custom clearance process, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Be aware that in most cases, not always,
customs may open your, not your boxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but your files.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Physical examination may cause delays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually not damages, although we saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, highly regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Documents and documents and documents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about documentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Licenses, permits, phytosanitary
certificates.
[SPEAKER_01]: COAs, all kinds of declarations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have the right documentation,
it will be stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you better have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, in Cannabalog,
our practice is we're not picking up even
[SPEAKER_01]: not one flower before we get all the
documents and we make sure that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: clear it on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just encouraging you to take the same
approach because there's no use to ship it
[SPEAKER_01]: if you cannot clear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, make sure that you can, clear it
before even you pick it up and take it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the airport or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other authorities, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just customs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Israel, if you want to clear a cannabis
shipment, you have to go through three
[SPEAKER_01]: agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minister of Health, Minister of
Agriculture, and Customs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada is, well, no import to Canada,
but a bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, other agencies, that you have
to go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Physical examination, already spoke about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full end-to-end control.
[SPEAKER_01]: In pharma, and I'm telling you,
I'm saying it again, it's a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the pharma world and the cannabis
world requires you as a shipper to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that you control the whole chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot say, yeah, ship it and that's
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have an audit from the authorities,
you will have to prove this that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: how to control the whole supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no stories about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you have to make sure that your
logistic service providers, tracking
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, whatever, you can control the
whole way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are very much recommending on time,
real time, data loggers so you can track
[SPEAKER_01]: the shipment all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there are delays or if there are
issues, you can know about it immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that we developed in the last
year is a very, very reliable land
[SPEAKER_01]: transportation within Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought here an example of a shipment
going out from Portugal to Germany by
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature control vehicle, GDP certified
company, and you can see perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is around 20 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less than 36 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try to see where it came from,
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's looking at the map to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And secured.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see a few pilots in the truck and
those poles are keeping the freight so it
[SPEAKER_01]: will not fall or move or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that many companies can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you have to find a very reliable GDP
certified provider, pharma grade service.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spoke about that online, GPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see at every point where the truck
is and what is the temperature inside the
[SPEAKER_01]: truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reliability, reasonable cost,
responsiveness if you wish, required
[SPEAKER_01]: documents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, when you move in Europe,
you cross borders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you look at this example,
they went from Portugal where it's legal,
[SPEAKER_01]: through Spain which is not legal,
France which is not legal, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany which is legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, cross border within the EU
is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to have the right
documentation and don't hide it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't write pharmaceuticals, write
cannabis, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as you have the import permit
and the export permit and your documents
[SPEAKER_01]: are good, you're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although you've passed those borders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but you have to have a very reliable
provider that can arrange the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, pre-arranged.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that the truck is living and you
sit down and pray.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I said pre-arranged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air freight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the cannabis goes by air
freight, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, I just want you to know
that there are very limited number of
[SPEAKER_01]: airlines that will carry cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not every airline will carry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just very limited number of airlines.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing is high cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry to say that the airlines are taking
advantage of our shortage and the cost to
[SPEAKER_01]: ship cannabis is very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much higher than other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you come to an airline with a
cannabis shipment, you will always have a
[SPEAKER_01]: delay of two, three days before they
approve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they have a procedure to approve
the cannabis, especially when you,
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance, shipping with let's say
Emirates General.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean those airlines that are going
through the Gulf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know the Gulf is, cannabis is not
legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have to approve it in the origin
station.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to approve it in what we call
transshipment station and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: destination.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes two, three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we have this, we call it okay to
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we have this confirmation from
the airline, we cannot move it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember, it's not that we pick it up
and ship it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to do some arrangement before we
can ship it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, direct flights are easier,
but Australia, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To Australia, almost no flights or not
direct flights, especially not from Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: and Europe, very limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be aware of two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, the transshipment point has
to be rearranged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never, ever, ever touch a U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: soil with cannabis shipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will confiscate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't use American airlines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean the American Airlines
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even think about landing in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis shipment with THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I just want to go with the lesson
learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that your packages, first of
all, optimal size.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look here in this palette,
you see that this shipper paid a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money for now, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the boxes are not completely on
the palette, but you're paying for the air
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, same thing about these thermal
covers, but nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Licenses validity day, I spoke about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avoid weekends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try not to stack on weekends because then
you will pay more storage and you cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: clear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to do it before the weekend or after
the weekend and original documents.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ruin doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it for Yoram Eshel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 255.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan your flight carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever ship before you make sure that
you can clear it and don't go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the good rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more time for Mr. Eshel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure if you have more questions about
the logistics, he will be outside waiting
[SPEAKER_02]: for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the International Cannabis
Business Conference, Berlin 2024.
