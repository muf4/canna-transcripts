[SPEAKER_00]: To bring conference greetings from the
Office of the Prime Minister of Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have the State Secretary for Public
Health Care and Public Health in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Office of the Prime Minister, please
welcome Dr. Metka Paragi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dear participants of the International
Cannabis Business Conference esteemed
[SPEAKER_01]: organizers, it has been a year since I
greeted you at this leading global
[SPEAKER_01]: business conference of the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sincerely pleased to once again greet
you on behalf of the Office of the Prime
[SPEAKER_01]: Minister, Dr. Robert Golub, and extend a
warm welcome to you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, I promised changes in the field
of cannabis legislation here in Slovenia
[SPEAKER_01]: and I am proud to say that in the past
year we have made significant strides
[SPEAKER_01]: towards a more modern European cannabis
regulation, something that was not
[SPEAKER_01]: possible in the last decade due to various
reasons and interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it is also a result of
developments in our country as well as in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe and in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: After decades of rejection, Europe has
fully restored cannabis' legal status as a
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine this year, with the historic
inclusion of the cannabis flower and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabidiol in the European Pharmacopeia.
[SPEAKER_01]: At home, numerous organizations,
Cancer Patients Association, Europa Donna,
[SPEAKER_01]: many other patients, as well as the
informed public and medical professionals,
[SPEAKER_01]: have increasingly been calling for the
regulation of cannabis for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical cannabis use is topic that is
gaining more attention worldwide as
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis represents a real supportive
medicine for many people facing conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: such as chronic pain, epilepsy,
multiple sclerosis, and the side effects
[SPEAKER_01]: of chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would we deny patients and scientific
community access to resource that could
[SPEAKER_01]: improve the lives of many?
[SPEAKER_01]: By fully regulating the use of cannabis
for medical purposes, we will provide
[SPEAKER_01]: Slovenian patients with easier,
safer, and more accessible paths to this
[SPEAKER_01]: forum of therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, due to the ban of cannabis
cultivation, we are dependent on importing
[SPEAKER_01]: these products which limits access to
treatment and raises costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, since cannabis is still highly
criminalized here in Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the fact that there are numerous,
often conflicting, expert and non-expert
[SPEAKER_01]: opinions about its use, we decided to ask
Slovenians about their views on this issue
[SPEAKER_01]: through the use of referendum.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you may know, in June of this year,
we voted in referendum on two questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cultivation and processing of cannabis
for medical purposes, and cultivation and
[SPEAKER_01]: possession for personal use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Voters approved the cultivation and
processing of cannabis for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes with 66.5% of the vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: The results of the vote on personal use
were closer, with 51.5% voters voting in
[SPEAKER_01]: favor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on the will of voters, we
immediately began working with the
[SPEAKER_01]: parliament members and esteemed experts to
draft a modern European outline for
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation on these two issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We established a group of experts from the
fields of medicine, pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_01]: biotechnology, legal sciences,
with the goal for ensuring
[SPEAKER_01]: multidisciplinary approach to resolving
cannabis release, related issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: and ensuring that the new legislation is
professionally prepared, consistent,
[SPEAKER_01]: and aligned with the latest findings,
both domestic and foreign experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the legislative approach, we will
follow the examples of EU member states
[SPEAKER_01]: that have already made the necessary
changes in their legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slovenia's current legislation does,
at least in theory, allow the use of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis products for medical purposes,
but this has never truly come to fruition.
[SPEAKER_01]: In practice, this is evident through its
very limited scope and numerous obstacles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Among other things, the position of agency
for medicinal products and medical devices
[SPEAKER_01]: also poses a problem, as it claims that
the use of cannabis for medical purposes
[SPEAKER_01]: is permitted in accordance with Medicine
Act, Pharmacy Practice Act, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, which is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, agency argues that due to the
lack of prescription guidelines,
[SPEAKER_01]: except for terminally ill patients,
the prescription of cannabinoids for other
[SPEAKER_01]: medical conditions is not permissible.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our opinion, this stance is incorrect,
as there are extensive prescription
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines prepared by countries with
comparable levels of healthcare.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, Netherlands, United Kingdom,
Canada, Australia, and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, I must also emphasize the past
unjust disregard for professional
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines prepared by the pioneer of
cannabis treatment in Slovenia,
[SPEAKER_01]: oncologist, Dr. Josepina Cervec.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the updated legal regulation,
we will also accelerate scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: research in this field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Slovenian research institutes have immense
potential, which we are not utilizing
[SPEAKER_01]: enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of straightening domestic science
and developing innovative medical
[SPEAKER_01]: approaches, we are dependent on imported
products, which are not only a missed
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity, but also hinders progress in
scientific understanding of the risk and
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a fact that cannabis use was never
so successfully prevented by prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather, the opposite is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, we must appropriately adapt our
legislation in more sensible and pragmatic
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: With appropriate legal regulation,
we can better protect patients from the
[SPEAKER_01]: black market and educate young people
about its use.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new legislation must therefore
comprehensively regular the field of
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis from cultivation,
processing, possession, and distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: to prescribing methods, as well as define
the limits of using cannabis for personal
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as personal cannabis is concerned,
the experience of other countries clearly
[SPEAKER_01]: shows that sensible regulation is crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of risking the consequences of
unregulated market, which is often
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with illegal activities and
dangerous products, legalization would
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce health risk and most importantly,
more officially protect young people.
[SPEAKER_01]: With full responsibility, we are
fulfilling our promise and preparing a new
[SPEAKER_01]: modern legislation in light with other
developed European countries, which will
[SPEAKER_01]: allow our citizens to legally access safe
and professionally supported cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products for their health and personal
well-being.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
