[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we're sitting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks everybody to spend your time with
us today at the last panel at the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to Engyo for being an amazing host
as always and thanks to Alex for giving us
[SPEAKER_05]: a place to gather and share these
dialogues because these dialogues are
[SPEAKER_05]: important and they're going to steer the
face of our industry in the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today we got a very unique group of people
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like we're all from very
different aspects of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when it's sales and marketing,
it's something that affects each and every
[SPEAKER_05]: one of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'll do is I'll go through the
panelists and get them to just do a short
[SPEAKER_05]: introduction so you know who they all are
and then we'll go through some questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why don't we start with you,
good sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Brett Worley.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm from MC Nutraceuticals.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the CEO and we're the largest
cannabinoid supplier in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in 29 countries.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have 700 clients and last year we
distributed 72,000 kilos of raw cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of oil to companies around
the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also on the board of American Healthy
Alternatives Association, which is the
[SPEAKER_06]: number one hemp advocacy group in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: where we write policy and protect the
cannabis plant's rights.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: 72,000 kilos, huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like those numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jonah Barber from Decimal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to give us a little introduction?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Jonah Barber with Decimal Engineered
Systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually started back in 2012 in Oregon
with starting from an analytical testing
[SPEAKER_07]: site.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were one of the first fully accredited
cannabis and hemp testing labs in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got started in building extraction
equipment actually based off test results.
[SPEAKER_07]: Being from the lab side, we were unique
because we got to see a lot of the
[SPEAKER_07]: products that were coming in, what was
popular.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we started seeing a lot of oil come in
overnight back in like 2014.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of the oil just had very heavy
solvents in it, just a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not really safe oil for consumption,
especially in the medical market side.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we looked at opportunity,
talked to a lot of our customers that are
[SPEAKER_07]: using other extraction technology and
realized there was really no
[SPEAKER_07]: repeatability, very low level of
accreditation or compliancy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we saw an opportunity where we could
build automated equipment that was
[SPEAKER_07]: repeatable, highest level of
accreditation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's where we started MRX
Extractors back in 2014.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then since then, we've just evolved as
a company to offer more extraction
[SPEAKER_07]: technologies such as ethanol, hydrocarbon,
distillation, isolation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we focused everything on building
for EUGMP compliancy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're essentially an OEM technology
provider for the extraction industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Jonah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jose Emanuel Lopez from Advanced
Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm Jose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from Galicia.
[SPEAKER_00]: My career, I was working in the cannabis
industry and a lot of things from the
[SPEAKER_00]: associations to making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I'm working the last four years
in Advanced Nutrients, selling nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly for the legal producers in the
European Union and also in the cluster of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last but certainly not least, Vladimir
Bautista, CEO and co-founder of the Happy
[SPEAKER_05]: Monkey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Buenos dias, mi gente.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and my partners founded Happy Monkey in
2017, the biggest cannabis lifestyle
[SPEAKER_01]: company in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been in the legacy market in New York
originally for 17 years before we started
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Monkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a total of 25 when you add the legal
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we've done is we've been able to
create sort of like an ecosystem from
[SPEAKER_01]: everything to media, to merchandise,
to apparel, to events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our big claim to fame was that we sort
of like followed some of the stuff we saw
[SPEAKER_01]: over here in Amsterdam and here in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started the first consumption
lounge in Times Square.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, fast forward, we are going to be the
first group to open two legal adult use
[SPEAKER_01]: retail dispensaries this year,
one in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just really excited to bring all our
talents, resources and knowledge to the
[SPEAKER_01]: adult use retail market in New York and
hopefully abroad.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jonah, we'll start with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to see, you know, the cannabis
industry seems at times to be extremely
[SPEAKER_05]: crowded, often really even saturated.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you position your company to stand
out?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think for us, it really came
down to, I think, accreditation and also
[SPEAKER_07]: being able to offer a wide array of
equipment offerings.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we've never just tried to force
a certain type of equipment or product on
[SPEAKER_07]: a customer.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really more about we view the
customers as partners.
[SPEAKER_07]: And during that process, like you really
have to get to know the partner and
[SPEAKER_07]: understand what their goals are,
what they're trying to produce,
[SPEAKER_07]: what their product matrices are,
their budget, their throughput,
[SPEAKER_07]: and not just try to make someone fit in a
box from that side.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we've really kind of approached it
that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we actually go through a very,
a pretty extensive, like what we call like
[SPEAKER_07]: a discovery process to where we actually
go, you know, sit down with the customer,
[SPEAKER_07]: go through expectations on both sides,
and really just try to make sure it's the
[SPEAKER_07]: right fit, you know, for everybody from
that side.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, sometimes, you know,
a good deal is walking away from a deal if
[SPEAKER_07]: it's not the right fit, you know,
for the customer and ourselves from that
[SPEAKER_07]: side.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then beyond that, I think just being
able to provide a level of automation that
[SPEAKER_07]: we're really known for.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in the industry that really
separates us from our competition is
[SPEAKER_07]: automation from an operator standpoint,
but also with data and analytics as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then with service and support,
and then from, again, what's most
[SPEAKER_07]: important for us is how we position
ourselves in North America.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody's asking for GMP.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you have anyone in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we knew the importance, if we wanted
to be taken seriously in Europe,
[SPEAKER_07]: that we had to do EUGMP.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we really went down that path about
four years ago to do that, to position
[SPEAKER_07]: ourselves today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's where we feel like we can
also bring a lot of knowledge to the
[SPEAKER_07]: customer, our customers, our partners in
Europe, because we've been doing this for
[SPEAKER_07]: 10 years in the U.S., but then we also add
the whole EUGMP side to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where we feel like we can bring
a lot of additional value.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jose, I have it all lined up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm reading off my phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the potential implications of
international cannabis legalization and
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations for businesses operating in
Europe?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how can these companies prepare for
these changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, in my point of view, the companies
who already were working in Europe the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 30 years, 20 years, 15 years,
we have to adapt our way of work to the
[SPEAKER_00]: new situation we have here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we were working in the past for an
unregulated market, with the unregulated
[SPEAKER_00]: market, and the requirements now are
different than before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will speak about four points.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my point of view, it's the more
important thing we have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing is adapt our products to
the laws and the regulatory regulations of
[SPEAKER_00]: each country that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is transmit the
information more concrete, more precise
[SPEAKER_00]: than until now, because the market demands
this kind of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to use other means that we have,
like LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube videos,
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to also look for synergies and
collaboration with other companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very important this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, for example, sell nutrients,
but I try to create a network around me,
[SPEAKER_00]: around my company, to offer a wider
support and offer everything the customer
[SPEAKER_00]: may need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last point, in my point of view,
also the more important is the quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality and the after-sales service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than until now, if seeds, only a few
companies already did it in the last 30
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, these four points is the key
for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brett, I wanted to ask you the same
question that I asked Jonah, because if
[SPEAKER_05]: you sold 72,000 kilos, I'm figuring that
you positioned your company to stand out
[SPEAKER_05]: in a very good way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please tell us how you did that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We looked at the consumer model and went
backwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: The hemp industry is uniquely positioned.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with a regulatory model that's
completely different than traditional
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, it's a more open market in most
senses.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure people have seen products like
Delta Aida in a gas station or in Europe,
[SPEAKER_06]: they've seen HHC around.
[SPEAKER_06]: These products, because of the openness to
the products, have seen a huge surge in
[SPEAKER_06]: demand.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who heard Beau Whitney
earlier, but I'm pretty sure he said a
[SPEAKER_06]: number like 28 billion.
[SPEAKER_06]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: market in hemp is around $28 billion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which makes it larger than the cannabis
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that only happened since 2018,
essentially, in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason for that, again,
is because there is an openness to the
[SPEAKER_06]: products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like a nicotine vape, it's right
there at the gas station or at the counter
[SPEAKER_06]: where someone can pick it up easily and
try it in case they don't want to go to a
[SPEAKER_06]: dispensary or don't have access to a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's also direct-to-consumer
shipments that we can do in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: and the same in Europe, kind of like
Amazon, where you can have a vape at your
[SPEAKER_06]: door within 24 hours or 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we did is we took that and looked
at what the consumer really wanted,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is ease of access and quickness to
the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we backward integrated into a raw
material company, which is a B2B company,
[SPEAKER_06]: where we supply all the brands.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we supply anywhere between 700 and 900
brands in a given month.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we give them the engine or the inputs
for whatever effective consumer is looking
[SPEAKER_06]: for.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have 46 cannabinoids in our arsenal
that all have different effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: Half of them are psychoactive,
half of them aren't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them help with sleep or pain or
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them get you really high.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it really depends on what the consumer
is looking like.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've just made our sales available to
address a consumer problem, really.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we've addressed,
and we've addressed it really well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And between marketing and sales and all
the other core things that matter in an
[SPEAKER_06]: organization and company culture,
we've hit all those boxes and we've been
[SPEAKER_06]: able to control a big portion of the
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: The market share of what the oil goes out,
whether it's CBN, THCV, HHC, THG,
[SPEAKER_06]: THGP, CBC, CBGA, CBDA, we sell them all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vlad, I wanted to ask you, because you're
really one of the guys that came from the
[SPEAKER_05]: legacy into the legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first of all, thank you for practicing
civil disobedience so that everyone that
[SPEAKER_05]: is involved in the legal cannabis industry
can be involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank your civil disobedience
practitioner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because without civil disobedience,
we would not have the industry that we
[SPEAKER_05]: have right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so how did you go about that
transition from legacy to legal and really
[SPEAKER_05]: continuing to make your company stand out?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like I mentioned before,
in 2017, when we started this consumption
[SPEAKER_01]: lounge in Times Square, it really took off
and we really noticed, fairly quickly,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we were onto something bigger than
just selling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more of like a movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started doing these events once a
month, 200 people a night, to once a week,
[SPEAKER_01]: to seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2019, Forbes called us the Studio 54
Cannabis before cannabis even got
[SPEAKER_01]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew we were onto something bigger
than just, you know, typically
[SPEAKER_01]: transactional cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we knew we could not, literally like,
you know, trademark cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't legal yet in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we trademarked the lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we started with first,
we started a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then from then, we started a newsletter,
turned into an e-magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then from there, merchandise, then
apparel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now the brand lived on past in
any physical place because now it had
[SPEAKER_01]: legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had made people feel a certain way for
three and a half years from New York
[SPEAKER_01]: across the country and around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that is something that
people are really not really understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like everybody, not only in this
industry, but I think in all industries,
[SPEAKER_01]: is looking for this magical digital bullet
where you're gonna push a button and your
[SPEAKER_01]: brand is gonna go global.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a firm believer that authenticity
matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have something tangible that
people felt that there's nothing strong in
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing than word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing stronger than a friend of
yours telling you they recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that you have to have that
spark before you can pour gasoline on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will be like these other different
digital forms of advertisement.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, you know, there would never be any
new brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything with all the ad space and all
the biggest brands will be owned by the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest people with the biggest dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not the case because if you
don't have something substantial,
[SPEAKER_01]: tangible, where you make people feel you
can't grow from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fast forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: After legalization in New York,
we knew we had to evolve with the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it got legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: We stopped doing the underground lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we did was I'm a firm believer in
collaboration over competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started collaborating with strategic
institutions that made us mainstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, we partnered with the Van
Gogh Immersive Experience, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: global art institution.
[SPEAKER_01]: We partnered with the Museum of Sex on
Fifth Avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things that weren't heard of
where these big institutions, museums are
[SPEAKER_01]: publicly partnering with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now society is looking at us and
cannabis differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that that's why we were able
to penetrate through all these
[SPEAKER_01]: advertisement rules and really,
you know, make our claim as the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: lifestyle brand in New York, because we
started with something tangible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made people feel us in a way we were
authentic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all the omnimedia channels we
created just amplified that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that kind of leads me into wanting to
ask you another question, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're, you know, the only retailer on
the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in light of the marketing restrictions
in New York State, as well as the
[SPEAKER_05]: explosion of illegal dispensaries
throughout NY, I want you to share how you
[SPEAKER_05]: plan to open a legal dispensary in the
face of these challenges.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I want to hear it from the perspective
of like, you came from legacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how important civil disobedience
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think you're going to be taking
the general sort of corporate mentality of
[SPEAKER_05]: like, well, we have to close all these
illegal shops down immediately in order
[SPEAKER_05]: for us to succeed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do you face that challenge?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a challenge that we face
globally in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer and the antidote for that
challenge is called education.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've learned that you can't arrest your
way out of these problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen it in the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen it in many countries around the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key is to educate people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've also been a big advocate for
legalization and for legacy being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: participate in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, last year on 420,
we collaborated with local community board
[SPEAKER_01]: from Harlem with Columbia University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we realized was that part of the
reason that the education that happens in
[SPEAKER_01]: these rooms was not being spread out to a
more larger audience was because
[SPEAKER_01]: geographically in New York, the biggest
conferences similar to this were,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in the most affluent areas like
96 to Wall Street for whoever has been to
[SPEAKER_01]: behind nose, which is like where the upper
crust is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were like, we can't complain and
think that the government is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: solve these problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to do what we can with the
platform that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we partnered with the community board,
with Columbia University.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought in some politicians to educate
people on the economic benefits,
[SPEAKER_01]: the legal applications of how they can
cross over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flew in a doctor, Dr. Knox, on the
endocannabinoid system to show people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we gave all this for free to the
community because people can't possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what's happening if the
information is not being brought to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had translation services for
people that did not speak English and only
[SPEAKER_01]: speak Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So through these efforts, we're going to
continue to educate the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to legacy, we are not fans
of our rest in our way out of this
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I plan on being an example to tell
them, I was once on a corner like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm no different than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do this, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a matter of fact, I would love to
mentor you and teach you A to Z how I made
[SPEAKER_01]: the transition so you can make it,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we have to create bridges
instead of moats to really fully optimize
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of our mission and vision
is to educate, elevate, and show people
[SPEAKER_01]: what's possible from the consumer
perspective and from the legacy
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the whole, like you said,
just try to arrest the way out of these
[SPEAKER_01]: problems has yielded no results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my method of how to challenge
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put on my regulatory hat
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Going through the process in New York to
acquire a license, what are your takeaways
[SPEAKER_06]: and opinions on it?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm more of a free market guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I sit on the hemp side.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to have competition rather than
regulatory barriers to entry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously, talking about legacy versus
regulated markets, I find it quite
[SPEAKER_06]: fascinating.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that the New York process was
interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd like to know your opinion on how
that process went for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe you can tell everyone else your
thoughts on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was definitely a little messy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rollout has been not the easiest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in comparison to the rest of the
country, it is the most equitable bill in
[SPEAKER_01]: the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in other states, somebody like
myself wouldn't be able to participate in
[SPEAKER_01]: the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they said if you had a record,
if you participated in the legacy market,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could not go to the legal market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, imagine that if you have
experience doing this, you're not allowed
[SPEAKER_05]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is unbelievable to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So New York changed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's you know, New York has the
mentality of more of mom and pops and
[SPEAKER_01]: small business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why New York is the first state
where MSOs and large corporations were the
[SPEAKER_01]: last ones to enter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because New York is a place where they
don't have Walmarts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have these big box sort of,
you know, operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, there's about 75 open and
they're all owned by marginalized small
[SPEAKER_01]: business people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bigger players are coming now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a better chance for it to be
more equitable and more full circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not to the extent that you
said, Brett, where it's like just free
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have different, all different
perspectives in the market from legacy to
[SPEAKER_01]: small business to larger companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's more of a robust different
option for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different options for the way you
do business.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York is also the only state in the
country where you can smoke cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere you can smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think was it perfect?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was far from perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely a challenge to get
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still better than what we've seen
throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I did appreciate your answer in
regards to legacy and legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, in Canada, we have extremely
it's extremely regulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, very highly regulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the companies that are trying to do
it legally, you know, they're they're
[SPEAKER_05]: they're putting their money in,
they're putting their lives on the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of stores that ended up
getting upset that the indigenous cultures
[SPEAKER_05]: came in and were like, we're not following
your rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're sovereign people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to do it this way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really had to help educate some of
these stores and saying these are your
[SPEAKER_05]: allies, not your competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not complain and bitch about their
abilities because they can advertise and
[SPEAKER_05]: they don't have milligram limits and they
can sell as much as they want,
[SPEAKER_05]: not just 28 grams.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in my opinion, if the indigenous
people can create a system that's more
[SPEAKER_05]: successful than the system that the
government creates, they will have to bend
[SPEAKER_05]: the knee to the indigenous way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe it will help all these people
that have legal stores in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like you're not even allowed to
to market in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of our packaging looks identical.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a real sort of it's not
necessarily the illegal and legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's these two different types of legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like the idea of what you said about
robust.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more options and opportunities that
are out there and that are being
[SPEAKER_05]: experienced in this cannabis business,
the more the quicker we will find the ones
[SPEAKER_05]: that are success rather than the ones
that, you know, regulatory framework wants
[SPEAKER_05]: us to follow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think I resonate with that
personally because the hemp industry is
[SPEAKER_06]: like lack of regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can advertise.
[SPEAKER_06]: My buddy's got his brand on a NASCAR,
for example.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I found it quite interesting,
you know, especially as I come to these
[SPEAKER_06]: events and meet more and more folk,
you know, the the complaints and qualms
[SPEAKER_06]: can be, you know, whether it's through
other means or creative means,
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe to marketing and sales.
[SPEAKER_06]: I find that fascinating, especially on the
hemp side where we can, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: make safe and responsible new molecules
that are that are able to be easily
[SPEAKER_06]: distributed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, there's always going to be
a fight back with that, as we as we all
[SPEAKER_06]: know.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, the open, you know,
my my opinion as a plant should be open to
[SPEAKER_06]: anyone that wants to try it as long as
they're over a certain age and we can talk
[SPEAKER_06]: about the certain age.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just depends where you are.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, this is this is medicine at
the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people use it for fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Switch gears just a slight bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to ask Jonah in regards to,
you know, building these brands and the
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of time that it takes to build a
brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your company went through a pretty major
rebrand rebrand recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: What what led you to that decision?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, what have been some of the
pros and cons of making that choice?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you know, when we started this
almost 12 years ago, I just always had
[SPEAKER_07]: envisioned that our company would be MRX
extractors.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's what we started with.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was blood, sweat, tears, just working
through the cannabis space where things
[SPEAKER_07]: change hour by hour, day by day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was real proud of the longevity and
the success that we had during those
[SPEAKER_07]: years.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, there is a natural
evolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, we're not the same company that we
were 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we really looked at it for a
variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_07]: One being the name MRX extractors was just
synonymous with just like extractors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we now offer a wide array of
additional equipment, offerings and
[SPEAKER_07]: services.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also really wanted to appeal to a
global market, you know, with a name that
[SPEAKER_07]: we thought would be accepted kind of
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was some of the major reasons.
[SPEAKER_07]: One was also just for an anecdotal,
having a name extractors in your bank
[SPEAKER_07]: account name.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got kicked out of about 10 banks
throughout the years in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: and stuff as well, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was better to have a name that was
maybe a little more discreet, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that one of the biggest
factors was, you know, we really had to
[SPEAKER_07]: reinvent ourselves during the COVID years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really brought on some really great
team members, some really well-respected
[SPEAKER_07]: industry people that had a lot of success,
you know, in their companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we all kind of came together and we
wanted to create a brand, a company that
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone had ownership in and a culture
just where everyone was proud,
[SPEAKER_07]: like they really built it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we did build off a lot of the
legacy foundation of MRX.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we felt like with actually doing a new
brand that everyone would just really buy
[SPEAKER_07]: into and have an ownership.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so for us, it's been a very,
very powerful thing and have no regrets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing that's been very positive.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if there was a con from it,
I think the only con was coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think some people thought like we were a
new company.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we didn't have, you know,
a lot of the history or track record from
[SPEAKER_07]: that side.
[SPEAKER_07]: But people pretty quickly realized that
we're just, it was more of a rebrand and
[SPEAKER_07]: we did have the long success of,
you know, building equipment for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you just kind of had to educate people
more is what it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, really glad we did it overall.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a good thing for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've got a couple more minutes
before we're going to go to some audience
[SPEAKER_05]: questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to ask Jose, what's the best
strategy and the biggest challenges for
[SPEAKER_05]: incumbent companies to reach a target
customer in the actual, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: in the cannabis market?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing, like I told you before,
is the regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to adapt our products to the
regulations we have in the different
[SPEAKER_00]: places, depending the product we are
selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same sell CBD flowers,
for example, than sell products for strats
[SPEAKER_00]: or nutrients, in my case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to make focus also in the
advertising, the way of communicate our
[SPEAKER_00]: message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very important, like I told
you before, also use in the new media we
[SPEAKER_00]: have, like LinkedIn or YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: The situation, I think, is good because we
have a big challenge ahead here in Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the numbers I have at least,
we will have more consumers than we have
[SPEAKER_00]: in the European, in U.S., for example,
or in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the market is bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to adapt our sales, the companies
that already sees, and the new ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to, in my point of view,
look for synergies with companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: already sees in Europe, and, well,
give a better message that we gave in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, the situation is unstoppable.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of countries are open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is a very big possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greece, Portugal, Germany, Morocco,
they are thinking make a pilot to legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivars of Beldiastrain,
for example, the same in South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, I think we have to make focus in
the way of communicate the message,
[SPEAKER_00]: open the door to make collaborations with
other companies, and enter with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe, looking for synergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, well, I think there are a big market
for us here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in the last minute or two here that
we have before we'll go to the audience
[SPEAKER_05]: for questions, is there anything that any
of you want to share with the audience
[SPEAKER_05]: that didn't get asked in questions that
you thought might be fitting for this
[SPEAKER_05]: particular conversation?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to add something to the audience,
especially us being here in Spain and
[SPEAKER_01]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to elude people to the biggest
elephant when it comes to marketing and
[SPEAKER_01]: sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, globally that really
has not really been fully optimized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, me and my company probably
being the biggest Latin owned brand in the
[SPEAKER_01]: East Coast is one that we're going to
really optimize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I recommend whoever can does the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that market is the Spanish speaking
market globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has not been really many brands in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: or globally that have been able to
authentically market to the Spanish
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking market in South America,
North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Caribbean, Europe, and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that the companies that do
will end up being some of the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: companies in the world because it's like a
sleeping giant that nobody's really
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to know whether they heard it
first because I'm definitely going to come
[SPEAKER_01]: for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also recommend if possibly you also
look into that because I think that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to definitely be really massive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was a question I had for Jonah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to ask all of you really,
the cannabis industry is global.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you approach a worldwide market?
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start with Jonah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, still figuring it out,
to be honest, because this is really our
[SPEAKER_07]: first, you know, we're in about a year and
a half and trying different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the most powerful thing and
it's one of the things Vlad hit on earlier
[SPEAKER_07]: as well, too, was just a strategic
alignment and collaboration.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so much that goes into getting
yourself established in a new territory.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of that comes to like trust,
especially when you're talking about like
[SPEAKER_07]: high value purchases and things like that,
that essentially you're marrying the
[SPEAKER_07]: company that you're buying.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you're buying something from them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so just how it's gone a very long way
to align ourselves with vendors like such
[SPEAKER_07]: as Huber who have like a global presence
and they've essentially asked us to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, work with them and put
equipment, you know, in their showrooms
[SPEAKER_07]: and in their exhibits and also stuff just
like ICBC here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I went to Berlin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Alex was just encouraged me.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to go to Berlin, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to go to Berlin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I went to Berlin and it was the best
thing we could have done.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, met some great clients,
but not just clients, just industry
[SPEAKER_07]: professionals that we've developed
relationships with that now trust us to do
[SPEAKER_07]: what we say we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they feel comfortable introducing
us, you know, to their network and
[SPEAKER_07]: friends.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to me, that's been the most valuable
thing for us to get into a global market
[SPEAKER_07]: is really collaboration and alignment.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to jump in and thank Alex real
quick for putting this all together for
[SPEAKER_06]: years now.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a he's a pioneer in the international
space.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I appreciate all he's done by putting
us all in the same room together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Alex.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure we had 40 minutes,
so I think we have 10 left, but and Gaio
[SPEAKER_05]: was kind of going to.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven minutes left.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there are any questions from the
audience for any of the esteemed panel
[SPEAKER_05]: members, we're happy to take those from
you now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And is there a mic that's going to be
moving around and Gaio?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, he's got it right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, if you got a question,
just throw up your hand and we'll give you
[SPEAKER_03]: the floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Daron Escobar, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vladimir, I have a question transitioning
from the legacy to to to license
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a gap, a difference gap in,
let's say, in Latin America.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from Colombia.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see that many companies or most of the
companies that invested in licenses do not
[SPEAKER_03]: know anything about the consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how would a company or then this is
this will be in the global market connect
[SPEAKER_03]: with the final consumer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if we go back, everybody that
started smoking or consuming cannabis is
[SPEAKER_03]: consuming from the legacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a different transaction of
language and just overall culture of how
[SPEAKER_03]: it's approached.
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you recommend a or a licensed
company to approach or to reach out to the
[SPEAKER_03]: final consumer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that goes back to what we've been
talking about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking backstage with some of the
some of the panelists here that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is the scalpel in this divided world where
everybody believes in so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis cuts through all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to get people in the same
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to create events.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to create conferences like Alex
has here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to create the incubator where
everybody, no matter whether they're
[SPEAKER_01]: legacy, legal, corporate, you know,
background, religion, race, sex,
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't matter where they feel like,
well, I consume cannabis or I want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cannabis industry and I can come to
this place and get information,
[SPEAKER_01]: share ideas and figure out how to
collaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Jonah said, I think that that is the
way you do it, because you have to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: people where they are, because it's all
amazing that we come here and we all
[SPEAKER_01]: understand this complex cannabis jargon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the regular consumer knows nothing
about what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to meet people where they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to create safe spaces for them to
gather at and show them that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits in consuming legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to show legacy that there's
benefits for them to cross over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to meet people where they are
and you have to create incubators like
[SPEAKER_01]: this for people to meet up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a process, but it starts with you and
your organization and then you inspire
[SPEAKER_01]: others and et cetera and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a response to that, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're now in Brazil and Mexico.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're starting to penetrate some of
those those Latin markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the first answer I'll say
is lawyer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of lawyers involved in
the process and a lot of creativity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we use a lot of science and
chemistry to get around regulations,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's a special blend for us in
international markets being in 29 now 30
[SPEAKER_06]: with Brazil.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, we just entered this week.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a special blend in between lawyers,
chemistry, science behind the plant and
[SPEAKER_06]: and getting creative.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, as someone that's not a
legacy operator anymore, we we've found
[SPEAKER_06]: creative solutions to complex problems
that are, you know, somewhat simple at the
[SPEAKER_06]: same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've been able to enter Mexico and
Brazil and we've been in Spain for a long
[SPEAKER_06]: time now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know, we've been able to figure it
out creatively with creativeness,
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a better word.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a word.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, many other questions from the
audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I had something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to give him time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get nervous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to you, Brett.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you backed into your business
from looking at what the consumer wants
[SPEAKER_02]: and upstream from that, what the products
require.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering as your business now gets
more visibility scale, as you said,
[SPEAKER_02]: and more presence, what that creativity
looks like in terms of you threading the
[SPEAKER_02]: needle on regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just you just spoke about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I I could imagine that that becomes a
more and more important part of your
[SPEAKER_02]: business focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So could you comment on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The consumer gets a little bit more
difficult international markets.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the first part of the question,
I'll speak in a U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: base, is we've reverse engineered the
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've isolated out all the cannabinoids
and made, you know, a lot of vapes or
[SPEAKER_06]: gummies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Specifically, we've made a product that's
an alternative to just smoking just THC or
[SPEAKER_06]: THC oil, for example.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, most vapes in a medicinal
recreational setting are just going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: extracted from the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to be 80 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might have a little bit of CBG or a
little bit of CBN in them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've now started to blend in 25
percent CBN, for example, to give a real,
[SPEAKER_06]: in my opinion, a real indica really,
you know, knock you out or put you to
[SPEAKER_06]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the same on the sativa side.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll put 25 percent THC in a product or
some CBG and it'll be more of a
[SPEAKER_06]: socializing higher or more of a energy
high.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, as far as the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: goes, we have a lot more freedom in order
to blend those products and make those
[SPEAKER_06]: products.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, with 46 cannabinoids,
we have companies that do eight
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoid blends.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a very large MSO that just entered
the hemp space on February 12th and their
[SPEAKER_06]: blend is seven to eight cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, in the U.S., it's a little
bit easier in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's harder because there are
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_06]: We usually only get the liberty of doing a
couple of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, our presence isn't as large and we
don't have the manufacturing capabilities
[SPEAKER_06]: due to the fragmentation, you know,
from, you know, every country is different
[SPEAKER_06]: in Europe and every country is different
in Latin America.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, eventually, I think this
will get to a point where, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: again, people can tailor their
cannabinoids to whatever they're really
[SPEAKER_06]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, just a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's running.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's running.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't trip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to keep things interesting here.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up, Brett?
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcus?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Europe, it seems like there's an
affinity for more complex cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: blends versus U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: market with all the miners emerging here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know you're the expert, Brett,
on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, how would you guys recommend a brand
go about starting to quantify the moods
[SPEAKER_04]: and impacts of these behavioral aspects of
these miners all combined together,
[SPEAKER_04]: the safety aspects of them, and how
ultimately we're going to market to
[SPEAKER_04]: consumers?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just the last question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the safety, I'll start on the
safety part, just because that's the first
[SPEAKER_06]: thing I always hear in one of these
questions, is, you know, when making these
[SPEAKER_06]: compounds and these molecules from the
cannabis plant, there is solvents and
[SPEAKER_06]: catalysts involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: And luckily for, I guess, the cannabis
industry is a lot of these products are,
[SPEAKER_06]: these same catalysts are used in the
production of vitamins and pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_06]: and even everyday food products.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there's a lot of literature over the
last hundred years.
[SPEAKER_06]: We call it green chemistry and the
chemistry space where it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's easy to make sure that they're
produced safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't mean that you should put them in a
garage and make them, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: as we talk about EU GMP.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I truly believe all these
products should be made in a GMP facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado is actually requiring it where
that's where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I think everything should be
produced in a, you know, food setting.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are food products or commodities of
food, in my opinion, and that's how we
[SPEAKER_06]: treat them personally at our company.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's the safety piece, but as far as
the blends get more complex in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 more seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: As the blends get more complex in Europe,
you know, again, it's what is the consumer
[SPEAKER_06]: taking and there's also the regulatory
part.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lots of regulatory coming down on
hemp in Europe and I think it is pushing
[SPEAKER_06]: people into a certain corner to go with
certain different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there's not a serious answer to why
they're being blended the way they are
[SPEAKER_06]: besides, honestly, regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: The regulations are a lot more stiff over
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys for being on the panel and
sharing your knowledge with the wonderful
[SPEAKER_05]: people here in the audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you, Alex, for putting on
another great event in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks for Engayo for hosting.
[SPEAKER_05]: As always, may the full melt bless your
bowl sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
