[SPEAKER_07]: Well, these chairs are very comfortable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check, check, check.
[SPEAKER_07]: You good?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is DJ Muggs.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_09]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cypress Hill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you've heard of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you've heard of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've had some hits.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been on TV.
[SPEAKER_07]: You were telling me earlier, this is your
17th time in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've been coming to Barcelona since
1988, you know, spent a lot of time here,
[SPEAKER_09]: did a lot of tours here, did a lot of
shows.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd be on tour and have three or four
days off.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'd come to Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd argue sometimes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the guys would want to be in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the guys would be in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'd split and then we'd meet up again
in Germany for the next show.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's important to spend time apart from
each other when you're on the road like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you have like 10 grown men on a on a
bus, which basically is a one bedroom
[SPEAKER_09]: apartment.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can only imagine the smell.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need a little break after when you're
on there for six weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what have you noticed any changes since
1988 in Barcelona?
[SPEAKER_07]: Has the weed gotten better or their clubs
cooler?
[SPEAKER_09]: The weeds got amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a lot of fucking dirt weed out
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, we would we would smuggle
it in from Amsterdam and we used to put it
[SPEAKER_09]: in the radio and put it in the cassette
and put coffee around it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, anything we can do to
smuggle weed around, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: And but the weeds got amazing out here.
[SPEAKER_09]: The clubs are amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's nice to be able to just go
and get some good weed down the block and
[SPEAKER_09]: just.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just nice to pop into the local.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any favorite clubs?
[SPEAKER_09]: HQ was good, you know, I mean,
a couple of the spots I popped in,
[SPEAKER_09]: so I can't remember all the names because
you're high.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't remember all of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Choco, HQ, La Colada.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: G13, Terpy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Terps was good, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Terps had some bomb ass weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Strain Hunters.
[SPEAKER_09]: Terp Army was fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fire, fire.
[SPEAKER_07]: So since 1980, Cypress Hill has been
around since 1988 or is that when you were
[SPEAKER_07]: in 783?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, my first group before Cypress Hill
was a group called 783.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we got the picture up
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that was 88, 88.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a song in the movie Colors.
[SPEAKER_09]: We was on tour with MC Hammer on tour with
Salt and Pepper on tour with today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tony, Tony, Tony.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we did, you know, World Tour and a
bunch of big stadium tours back then.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ever challenge Hammer to a dance off?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I didn't win, though.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you did you dance when you were in
seven?
[SPEAKER_09]: I did the running man.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was a motherfucking running man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Roger Rabbit, motherfucker boy.
[SPEAKER_09]: We did the WAP, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember the WAP?
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just can't imagine the Soul Assassins
doing the WAP.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, we like to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when it's time to party, we party.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's time to do business.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do business.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you when you joined Cypress Hill,
was it a conscious decision to be very
[SPEAKER_07]: centric?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I actually was down with Cypress
before 7A3.
OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that was my hood.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was where we was from.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you knew all those cats growing up or
from California?
[SPEAKER_09]: I met him in like 80 from California.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were selling weed together,
selling weed, hustling, doing our thing,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I met these guys from Brooklyn
and they had a they had a song out called
[SPEAKER_09]: 7A3 Will Rock You, which was just a
single.
[SPEAKER_09]: They was down with Ice Team and I was
throwing a party and I was like,
[SPEAKER_09]: do you guys want to come and play at my
party?
[SPEAKER_09]: So they came and the DJ didn't show up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I stepped in and I became the DJ that
night and they said, we have three shows
[SPEAKER_09]: with Ice Team next week.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to do the shows with us?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I went I did the shows and then two
weeks later we was in the studio doing a
[SPEAKER_09]: song called Mad, Mad World for the movie
Colors, which was my first cold record in
[SPEAKER_09]: 1988.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember that about a couple of months
later, we got we got a record deal to get.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got signed to Geffen Records and the
album came out in 89, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: and we was out.
[SPEAKER_09]: We was on start doing world tours.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I told the Cypress guys, I was like,
listen, man, I'm going to go figure this
[SPEAKER_09]: music business thing out and I'm going to
bring it all back.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would just always come back.
[SPEAKER_09]: I learned this and I learned this.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need a logo.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need a concept.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the first time they told me,
do you have a logo?
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't know what the word was and what
it meant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what was your concept?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, but I took all the knowledge I
gained and brought it back to the hood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: So marketing is that the advice you give
the young musicians?
[SPEAKER_07]: I always give the young comics that
advice.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, if you do, I'd be like,
take a marketing class.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was before YouTube and all that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: It was like hands on.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you didn't know anybody back then,
you was fucked.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you can just go online and look at it
all up.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, it was you had to be in the
trenches.
[SPEAKER_09]: You had to go to the parties.
[SPEAKER_09]: I learned to DJ by going to the club and
watching the DJ looking at him.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would go home and try to do that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's easier now with the computers and the
things they got.
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ schools now.
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ school.
[SPEAKER_07]: The school of DJing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go take a class.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you teach lessons?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you professor mugs now?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I teach by the homies if they want
to learn, they can pull up and I'll take
[SPEAKER_09]: care of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: So was cannabis always part of the
marketing plan for Cypress Hill or is it
[SPEAKER_07]: just that you guys smoked a lot of weed
and you were like, fuck it, we're putting
[SPEAKER_07]: it on everything?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, 783 was managed by Rush Management,
which was Russell Simmons, who owned Def
[SPEAKER_09]: Jam.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I sat with Mr. Bill, who did the
Public Enemy Records and everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was like, so you have a logo.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, what was that?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he told me he was like,
what's your concept?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, what's a concept?
[SPEAKER_09]: And he said, you know, Run DMC is the
gangsters of rap, Slick Rick's the story
[SPEAKER_09]: storyteller.
[SPEAKER_09]: LL Cool J is the B-boy of hip hop.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your concept?
[SPEAKER_09]: And 783 didn't have one.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I thought about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I got back to Cypress,
I was like, yo, we got to be the Cheech
[SPEAKER_09]: and Chong's of this motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like come at it like weeds are shit
because we smoke.
[SPEAKER_09]: But everybody in weed at that time was
talking about don't smoke weed like Dr.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dre was saying, I don't smoke weed or
cess.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it gives a brother brain damage.
[SPEAKER_09]: Brand Nubians was like, slow down.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: We was like, light this motherfucker up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember when y'all came out and
everybody was like, man, these cats are.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because, you know, a lot of a lot
of musicians and a lot of performers,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially back in that time in the early
90s, late 80s, early mid 90s, they all
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody smokes weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But everybody was super hush hush and very
discreet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you didn't let anybody know was
something you did.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, but you guys were on stage with
giant bongs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, we brought the eight foot bong
on stage.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: We was like we was we was about it,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And got you kicked off a Saturday Night
Live, did it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I went on.
[SPEAKER_09]: We went on national television.
[SPEAKER_09]: We went on Saturday Night Live and I was
rolling my joint backstage and about eight
[SPEAKER_09]: people ran.
[SPEAKER_09]: But eight people came backstage and see me
at, you know, about five minutes
[SPEAKER_09]: increments.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was like, don't like that on stage.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't like that on stage.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't like that on stage.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, no problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't.
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew we had two songs and everybody
smoking weed backstage.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you couldn't smoke weed backstage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that was just the 70s.
[SPEAKER_09]: That shit was OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I knew we had two songs, so I couldn't
do it on the first song because we would
[SPEAKER_09]: have got kicked out.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I came on stage and I was like,
New York City, can I light my joint?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I lit it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they said the phone started ringing
and the phones was ringing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I got off stage, oh, boy,
they let me have it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They ripped into me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: We was punk rock.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't fire me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I was like, they can't even prove it
was a joke.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, you can't come back on Saturday
and live again.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, fuck Saturday and live,
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even want to come back on his
motherfucking end.
[SPEAKER_09]: Y'all are cornballs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, here we are now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now this is legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks to you, you guys helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: First hip hop group on high times.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we was the first hip hop group on
high times.
[SPEAKER_09]: But not only that, it's like we I'm going
to say this right quick, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we saw you on high times,
that's when I learned to smoke blunts
[SPEAKER_07]: because y'all were talking about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, we got to try this shit out
because in California, we didn't really
[SPEAKER_07]: have blunts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like in New York at the time, the weed
wasn't that good.
[SPEAKER_09]: So my fuckers in New York would smoke
blunts to make the weed better.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we had the good weed in Cali,
but the homies didn't really had a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: good shit out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, and at that time I met Steve
Bloom from high times and we started doing
[SPEAKER_09]: we started raising money for normal.
[SPEAKER_09]: The National Organization Reforming
Marijuana Laws.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did over 20 events for them to
raise money so they can fucking pay the
[SPEAKER_09]: pay the lawyers to go to Congress and they
could lobby for the legalization of
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, back in the early 90s,
we was putting in the work to get us to
[SPEAKER_09]: where we all are today.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it didn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it didn't keep y'all from getting
too many gigs because some I remember in
[SPEAKER_07]: the 90s, some people would talk about weed
and the gatekeepers and the powers that be
[SPEAKER_07]: like, well, we're not really going to work
with these guys because they talk about
[SPEAKER_07]: weed too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you guys were very kind of centric and
it didn't seem to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the president.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, you sold records.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tommy Mottola, the CEO of Sony Music.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Donnie Einer would let us smoke in
the offices and it was like all cyber
[SPEAKER_09]: sales in the building because it smelled
the whole fucking 34th 34th floor.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when I would get to Arizona,
the cops would be waiting for us by the
[SPEAKER_09]: stage and like, don't smoke when you go on
stage.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I get to New Mexico, the cops was on
stage.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I get to Texas, the cops was right
there waiting for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And back then in Texas had a no tolerance
law.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you had one joint, you was doing a
year in jail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona was some
other shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: New York and L.A., you get a little weed,
they'll either slap you on the ass,
[SPEAKER_09]: tell you to go home or they'll take you in
for the night just to put you in the
[SPEAKER_09]: system and spit you out the next day.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: So we went through all that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got locked up in L.A.
[SPEAKER_09]: at Gang of Times.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got locked up in New York for weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, some of the other states,
we fucking had to dip and dodge and run.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I remember before before the EU
was the EU, you know, you had to go
[SPEAKER_09]: through checkpoints every place and coming
into coming into France all the time on a
[SPEAKER_09]: tour bus.
[SPEAKER_09]: That motherfuckers is on your bus,
boy, like motherfuckers with the dogs
[SPEAKER_09]: looking for anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had Eric Bobo in my band one time,
get to passport control and open up his
[SPEAKER_09]: passport.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was a piece of hash stuck to his
fucking passport.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a joke in my act about that,
like never hide hash in your passport.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the first place they look.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was always that little roach in
the back of your pocket, some place that
[SPEAKER_07]: they would find, you know, always for like
a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if you don't have to check your
pockets before you get on the plane,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, before you pack your luggage.
[SPEAKER_07]: I buy new luggage.
[SPEAKER_07]: I buy new luggage and new clothes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I still find weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I found a gram of dabs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was on a plane.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was on the plane like two years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was on the plane flying to Barcelona and
I reached in my pocket for something and I
[SPEAKER_07]: found like a gram of dabs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, ah, I think we've got a
mind of its own.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, I might hide in this other
pocket.
[SPEAKER_09]: He don't even know I'm here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Watch this shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just this is how it goes when you're
when when cannabis is a lifestyle and not
[SPEAKER_07]: a hobby.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what else are you working on,
man?
[SPEAKER_07]: You do Soul Assassins.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Cypress Hill doing anything?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cypress Hill is nonstop.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we do over 100 shows a year
still.
[SPEAKER_09]: Still.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Still make records.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's every three days.
[SPEAKER_09]: On cannabis shops.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sell weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Green thumb.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's Dr. Green thumb.
[SPEAKER_09]: My brother B real.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do a lot of behind the scenes things in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just still pushing the culture.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Our whole thing has been pushing the
culture, pushing the culture, being in the
[SPEAKER_09]: doing the tangible things, you know,
being behind the scenes, just still being
[SPEAKER_09]: a force to reckon with behind everything
that we're pushing forward.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because our new tour is called We
Legalized It.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's that's what the new tour is called.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you were just talking about Nevada
and Arizona and New Mexico, and they've
[SPEAKER_07]: all legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got to tell you, it's much easier to
hang out in Arizona when you can be high
[SPEAKER_07]: and bored and not just sober and bored.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've never been to Arizona.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hot and boring.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they're all fucking there because
all the motherfuckers are doing meth over
[SPEAKER_09]: there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sitting in the house in the air
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you smoke weed and be all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's got the who's got the best weed
besides California?
[SPEAKER_07]: We already know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, shut up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I rep my hood.
[SPEAKER_07]: California, California.
[SPEAKER_07]: But let's let's talk about it in Europe.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amsterdam, Spain.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spain got some good shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Spain has some good shit out here.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I mean, Amsterdam's all always
had the bomb.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amsterdam's always been, you know,
the one the spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was always the spot for us to come
visit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially 9192.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it was.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no place else you can go
experience like the the the cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: lounge culture grown up cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go sit down, blow your spliff,
have a coffee, just relax and sit back
[SPEAKER_09]: and, you know, and enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like that was a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like my first experiences of that in the
early 90s is just visiting Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_09]: being able to go to the coffee shops and
was it mind blowing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we got to bring this back to the
states and 100 percent everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We tried opening up a couple of coffee
shops out there and we got to the final
[SPEAKER_09]: stages of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, the partnerships we was
trying to hook up with people just never
[SPEAKER_09]: panned out at the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we tried early on to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can be to be like, you know,
everybody went to the Bulldog back in the
[SPEAKER_09]: days.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We would like to have the Cypress Hill
cannabis, you know, cafe.
[SPEAKER_07]: You had a spot in L.A.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we got we got multiple spots under
different names.
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, the consumption lounge that I have
is my studio because I really,
[SPEAKER_09]: I really don't want to go smoke weed with
a bunch of strangers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I get creative when I smoke.
[SPEAKER_09]: So come to my studio.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a fucking gym in my studio.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a theater room.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got studios.
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody comes to my studio.
[SPEAKER_09]: We watch the games.
[SPEAKER_09]: We work.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's that's my consumption lounge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: How much is the membership?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do I sign up?
[SPEAKER_09]: You just got to be the homie.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just pull up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just pull up.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got we got we got we got apartments in
the back if you want to stay there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, be careful what you say to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Be careful what you say, because I'll come
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need a roller.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need somebody to load bongs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll roll the blunts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll make sure that your your edibles are
all topped up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you cook?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you make the edibles?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you careful with edibles?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you fuck with them?
[SPEAKER_09]: I fuck with edibles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Heavy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you on one right now?
No.
OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might be a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I drink coffee, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Weed and coffee.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't smoked yet, but I will after
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm be higher than giraffe titties.
[SPEAKER_07]: After this, so.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's a giraffe look like?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's kind of high up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to look.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't swing off them or nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: How did we get to that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know how we got there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's the most famous person you ever
smoked weed with?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Back in the day, I got high with Tommy
Chong once.
[SPEAKER_07]: I shook Willie Nelson's hand, but I never
Johnny Depp.
[SPEAKER_09]: You say Johnny Depp.
[SPEAKER_09]: Johnny Depp.
[SPEAKER_09]: We smoked weed with Johnny Depp before.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lindsay Lohan.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's Howard Stern?
[SPEAKER_07]: Howard Stern.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know he smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who was the person you were most
surprised?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I mean, I don't know if you're
outing any celebrity.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every I can't remember all the people,
but everybody was like, download.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got any weed?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just they just didn't want to let
anybody know like it was there was a
[SPEAKER_09]: fucking bad thing to do back in the days.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it wasn't a bad thing to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just a bad thing for other people
to know about.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just had to be discreet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was tough to be open.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I mean, not for you guys,
but it was because you would fail for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You were threatened by the hippie culture.
[SPEAKER_09]: They put the clamp down on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: They came and just wanted to just shut
that shit down.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they did.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't have any enlightenment or people
being against war.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't want that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you don't want that at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want people to be free.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want people to be thinking and
open and happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we can't have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That leads to people eating good and and
proper education and getting along,
[SPEAKER_07]: being respectful and getting along and
having love for their fellow man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That won't do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't make no money off of people getting
along.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the tension?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not good television.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got to have conflict.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't have reality TV where everybody's in
a good mood.
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy and shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Give each other hugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hugs this week on reality TV.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just going to hug each other and
smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give some massages.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was funny to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what were we talking about?
[SPEAKER_09]: Weed and music.
[SPEAKER_09]: Weed and music that come together.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are two things in this world that
bring people together.
[SPEAKER_09]: You go to a concert.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's people at that concert that you
would never hang out with ever in your
[SPEAKER_09]: life.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're there together.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I felt at the Taylor Swift
concert.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: To enjoy the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: And weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like weed and music has brought me places
and brought me to people in places that I
[SPEAKER_09]: never thought and imagined I'd be.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it brought me to people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like definitely opened the shit
the fuck up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, shit, here we are at a business
conference in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you imagine that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 1989?
[SPEAKER_07]: A weed business conference.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Back when weed business was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me get a dime.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: When dimes were that big.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could get a nickel bag for four
dollars if you knew.
[SPEAKER_07]: A nickel bag would be a.
[SPEAKER_07]: With a bunch of seeds and stems.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was five dollars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you remember seeds and stems?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you that old?
[SPEAKER_09]: Junior high, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get the nickel bag and it was about
fucking that goddamn like an eighth.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was all fucking stems and seeds in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to scoop it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pull that shit out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Scoop it out on the record.
[SPEAKER_09]: You smoke and the shit would be popping.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The smell of a burning seed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the homeless would be like,
yo, you ain't going to be able to have
[SPEAKER_09]: babies if you smoking the seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't got to get my nuts cut now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could just smoke seeds in the
motherfucking.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even got seen Samia without seeds
since Samia.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where it comes from.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you all speak Spanish.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think most of you speak.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how many people speak
Spanish.
[SPEAKER_07]: You speak Spanish.
[SPEAKER_07]: One mugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: You speak any Spanish.
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk some shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: You talk some shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You talk some shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can start a fight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all the bad words.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you learn.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you learn.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you learn.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think the future of of
cannabis and music is?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, it's the field of
infinite possibilities with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody wanted it to go legal.
[SPEAKER_09]: And here you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: But once it goes legal, you get the
government involved.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: And they keep changing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the target.
[SPEAKER_09]: You shooting at the target and they move
the motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_09]: And every time you think you got it in
your sights, they're going to keep moving
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the challenge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Y'all motherfuckers got to deal with if
you want to be in a legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a struggle.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a battle.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't be a little bitch.
[SPEAKER_09]: Be ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: The strong will survive.
[SPEAKER_09]: The motherfuckers that are forward
thinkers that are smart, that are making
[SPEAKER_09]: the right connections, that are getting
with the right people and the
[SPEAKER_09]: motherfuckers that are just getting in
here to get rich.
[SPEAKER_09]: You ain't going to survive and get the
fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, because it will eat you up and
chew you up and spit you the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've seen all those dudes by the
wayside, all that roadkill.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, yeah, but I'm loving that it's
opening up and, you know, human beings
[SPEAKER_09]: that would have never smoked and never
thought about smoking, they're smoking it
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're open to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just beautiful to just see it
opening up globally.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's slow.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to take some more time.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to take a lot more work,
but we're on the right path, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are on the right path.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you do about it?
[SPEAKER_07]: I was talking to somebody earlier today
about legalization and regulations and
[SPEAKER_07]: getting things in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, they're having problems in
Barcelona right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: A bunch of the clubs were visited by the
police last night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody got shut down, but there were some
inspections and things because they got a
[SPEAKER_07]: new mayor.
[SPEAKER_07]: The new mayor isn't as friendly toward
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it ain't legal, but they're going to
come shut you down for a night.
[SPEAKER_09]: Grab your shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: You open up the next day, you bring it
back in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the fucking right.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the peekaboo game.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hide and go seek.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: But I feel like there's always going to be
a certain percentage of people that are
[SPEAKER_07]: just going to hate no matter what.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we can't expect science and common
sense to win the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we did that, we wouldn't have racism.
[SPEAKER_07]: We wouldn't have cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_07]: If people just believed in science and
common sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's always going to be a small
amount of people who just hate weed no
[SPEAKER_07]: matter what.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be a certain amount of
people that just hate themselves no matter
[SPEAKER_09]: what.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need more love.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always need more love.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always need more love.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Motherfuckers be bored.
[SPEAKER_09]: They be bored so they just start hating.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like where I live, you could park your car
and all the work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody who works at the restaurants
parks their car.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's a bunch of old ladies.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're bored.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they just went around doing a petition.
[SPEAKER_09]: So nobody could just park their car no
more.
[SPEAKER_09]: They want a only two hour limit or you get
a ticket.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're just motherfuckers is
bored.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's the same motherfuckers that are
bored that got nothing to do that don't
[SPEAKER_09]: want cannabis, you know, legal.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need more activities for old bored
people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, people are fucking weird,
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should set up a pickleball court.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to smoke some weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Old stoners are way cute anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Old stoners are way cuter than old drunks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grandpa's hitting the bong again is funny.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, they just had the wrong influences
when they was young.
[SPEAKER_09]: They needed an older brother or sister to
make them smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: How old were you when you first started
smoking?
[SPEAKER_09]: 14.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that was too early?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it just was.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was what it was.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just we was there with the homies
kicking it and that's you did it or you
[SPEAKER_09]: didn't kick it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you do you have children?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I got one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did did you talk to them about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you say?
[SPEAKER_09]: She just grew up seeing her dad smoking
weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't hide it.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I mean, it's just there's the
magazine.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a dad.
[SPEAKER_09]: She don't smoke, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: My kids didn't smoke till college.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was very since they were little because.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't hide it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, no drugs till college.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get your shit together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Handle your business.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if you do that, then maybe you
can you can do some drugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then now they're little stoners.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they couldn't be up for weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: They ate a edible one time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think she said she found out an accident
because the maid put it in with the
[SPEAKER_09]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, man, it's five in the
afternoon and they're still sleeping.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then she got up and got all your eyes
started throwing up and shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, you OK?
[SPEAKER_09]: And she's like, man, we ate that
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's like, please don't tell my mom.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, I got you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're like, yeah, you don't tell your
mom either.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I think that was it.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's doing none of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's funny because my mom didn't smoke and
I was smoking as a kid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I smoke and my daughter don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a rebellion.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always I always figured my kids weren't
going to smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be like, come smoke a joint with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, no, I have to work at the stock
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: What?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no child of mine is going to have a
job.
[SPEAKER_07]: You learn that from your mother.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're DJing the party tonight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a playlist planned or was it
all Barry Manilow or what are you going
[SPEAKER_07]: to?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody got any requests for tonight?
[SPEAKER_07]: George Clinton, Soul Assassins.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Willie Nelson.
[SPEAKER_07]: Afrobeat.
[SPEAKER_07]: You like the Afrobeat?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Soca.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Bachata.
[SPEAKER_07]: All that shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You going to do the Running Man?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get Alex.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get Alex to do the Running Man.
[SPEAKER_07]: He'll come out and pop and lock,
do the Cabbage Patch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you Cabbage Patch do, Alex?
[SPEAKER_07]: Alex is going to do the Cabbage Patch,
bust out a couple of freestyles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, more bounce.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody have questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to take some questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_07]: What time is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: How long have we been talking?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have like 10 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is when we do questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anyone have questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we cover it all?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I can ask more questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your favorite color?
[SPEAKER_07]: Black.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you were any sort of tree, what would
you be?
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis tree.
[SPEAKER_07]: Male or female?
[SPEAKER_07]: Male.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spreading my seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spreading your seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad you said it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say it, but I didn't know
if it would be appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alex Ravitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, Mugs, to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: A huge fan for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seen Cyprus back in Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is a bit specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I ever had a chance to meet you,
I always wanted to ask you about the Soul
[SPEAKER_01]: Assassins album, which I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such an epic album.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a whole story it tells, like from
beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: How come more people don't do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems such a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't really seen that ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: To tell the story from beginning to end,
like kind of like a soap opera rap kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I got two parts to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why anybody doesn't do
anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: But my thing was I just wanted something
to be very cinematic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had like I think 12 different
artists on there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, how can I make this feel
like a cohesive piece of work and bring it
[SPEAKER_09]: all together so it didn't sound like a
compilation record or it didn't sound like
[SPEAKER_09]: a mix tape?
[SPEAKER_09]: So you sat down, you felt like you was
just listening to an album by one artist.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the reason I put it together
like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you sat down, you got the
experience of just you're listening to one
[SPEAKER_09]: artist and not just a random ass
compilation of soundtrack.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the challenge on that sometimes,
too, is in the digital age, people don't
[SPEAKER_07]: just put a record on or put a tape on and
let it play all the way through.
[SPEAKER_09]: Put the CD in your car and it stays there
for a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now it's, you know, your playlist will
skip around all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people think they make singles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't necessarily put together,
you know, a concept album like the Soul
[SPEAKER_07]: Assassins album or What's Going On from
Marvin Gaye or even that Styx album about
[SPEAKER_07]: Kilroy or whatever, where it's like a
whole story.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's everything is so people don't really
have the attention span like they used to,
[SPEAKER_07]: except for Alex the stoner who listens to
whole albums all the way through and
[SPEAKER_07]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, there was another question over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mugs, long time listener, first time
caller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg from D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to ask you, what artists
have you enjoyed working with lately?
[SPEAKER_09]: Lately, I really like this kid named Razz
Fresco from Canada, Roma Streets from New
[SPEAKER_09]: York, Mayhem Loran, this kid named TF from
Los Angeles, which I think our album is
[SPEAKER_09]: going to be ridiculous right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a bunch of songs together.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm working with CeeLo Green right
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Half the album is done.
[SPEAKER_09]: The shit's amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I'm having a good time right
now finding these these young artists that
[SPEAKER_09]: are really that I'm really inspired by and
helped like giving them my platform and
[SPEAKER_09]: giving them a platform to go reach the
world.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because money isn't my motivation or more
and fame isn't my motivation.
[SPEAKER_09]: My motivation is just to keep expanding
the kind of music I love to do and keep it
[SPEAKER_09]: alive and keep it growing and help these
artists, you know, reach their dreams and
[SPEAKER_09]: help help their goals coming into
fruition.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Into your OG uncle phase.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me ask you this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun as fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking about some of the new cats.
[SPEAKER_07]: But let me ask you, who were some of your
like influences and not necessarily hip
[SPEAKER_07]: hop influences, but like musical
influences when you were a younger cat?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, like, oh, man, Jimi Hendrix,
Led Zeppelin, Bob Marley, Ramel Z,
[SPEAKER_09]: Run DMC, Larry Smith, who produced
Houdini, Run DMC, Public Enemy,
[SPEAKER_09]: into like Picasso, Alejandro Jodorowsky,
you know, people like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Alejandro Jodorowsky, he's a filmmaker
from.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Jodorowsky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking musicians.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said filmmaker.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's that's kind of inspiration
comes from every place.
[SPEAKER_09]: There isn't a lot of music these days that
inspires me anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: I find it outside of music.
[SPEAKER_09]: Things that inspire me.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I read a juggling book one time
and his advice to juggling performers was
[SPEAKER_07]: don't be inspired by other jugglers,
be inspired by different artists and then
[SPEAKER_07]: incorporate that into your juggling.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like my comedy show is definitely set
up like a Grateful Dead concert.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I feel what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like Jodorowsky, any other non musician
influences on your music?
[SPEAKER_09]: Picasso, you know, Picasso is in his prime
in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of times musicians is like he done
in 30 is like now we I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not even in my prime yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: We just work out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you don't see that you had Killer
Mike, 48 years old, won three fucking
[SPEAKER_09]: Grammys this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: The producer of the year was in his 40s.
[SPEAKER_09]: The artist of the year was in his 40s.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: So y'all are giving me hope right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of times the commercial music
business is always looking for the new
[SPEAKER_09]: young hot thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: With the one good thing about the digital
age, there's a lot of bad things.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the good things about it is I can go
direct to my consumer around the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have to go through a gatekeeper,
through a label and through a publicist
[SPEAKER_09]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could just touch the people at the
fingertips.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I got seven billion people right there
on my fingertips right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Muggs out here touching to them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's definitely a benefit for the
legacy artists in the music business.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there another question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: During this day, we learned a lot,
of course, and a couple of times it was
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned that cannabis is science.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it came through this interview that
cannabis is love.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a request.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you play later your favorite love song
for us?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_09]: To the windows or the walls?
[SPEAKER_07]: From the window to the wall.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a love song, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, I'm like, hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: That Fetty Wap song is definitely a love
song.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to introduce you to my stove.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very sweet love song about the trap
game.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll hear it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, mister.
[SPEAKER_06]: How come you in Medellin, Colombia?
[SPEAKER_09]: I came four years ago with my friend Crime
Apple.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we made an album there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I stayed for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_09]: We made a whole album in Medellin.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a good time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I played a small show on a small club with
only 100 people.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we didn't announce it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just showed up.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm coming next time, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: November.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, baby, let's go.
In Colombia.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for Medellin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm coming to our Congress.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take me with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Medellin, baby, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need someone to carry your luggage
or whatever, let me know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any more time for questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, one more from Ian Rasmund and then
that'll do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was first.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy and then Ian and then that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a question about that you mentioned
earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: You like edibles now between flour,
extracts and edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which ones you go to?
[SPEAKER_07]: Flour, flour, tea flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have a strain in particular.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't leave me hanging.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're leaving me hanging.
[SPEAKER_09]: Man, you know, I mean, it just depends.
[SPEAKER_09]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll smoke some TVs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like outdoor sometimes when I'm in the
studio outdoor.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I'm watching a movie, I'll smoke
something real heavy like some O.G.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: But I keep it light these days.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, are you one of the type of people?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's two kinds of people that
smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're stoners.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's people who get high and like
stones like a rock.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to get high.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to sit on the fucking couch
and you're going to be stoned.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I smoke weed, I want to go for a
hike.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to read a book.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to make music.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to go to the gym.
[SPEAKER_09]: So weed affects me like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me let me ask you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some people I know should never smoke weed
because they smoke and they're just
[SPEAKER_09]: sitting there with their fucking tongue
out and they don't get shit done.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like I got friends who drink.
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to fight.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I drink and just get happy and want to
laugh.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to understand what your body
chemistry is, you know, what your goals
[SPEAKER_09]: are.
[SPEAKER_09]: So everything isn't for everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you master yourself and
understand yourself when it comes to
[SPEAKER_09]: intaking anything, bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I have some homies who always have a
bunch of different kinds of weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they have clean the house weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have sit on the couch weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have administrative tasks weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get high and have sex weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Netflix and chill weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: The smokey pokey is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you play Dr. Green Thumb tonight?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I will.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want the English version or the
Spanish version?
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you say Green Thumb in Spanish?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cómo verde?
[SPEAKER_07]: Verga verde?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dedo.
Dedo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dedo.
Dedo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dedo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dedo.
Dedo.
Dedo.
Dedo.
Dedo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dedo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dedo verde.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gracias.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, one question for me and then for real,
we got to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard that you recently released a wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us a little about the
inspiration behind that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, I'm I'm a big fan of natural
wines.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I've always drank wine.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the first time I drank natural wines,
I was, you know, a lot of times regular
[SPEAKER_09]: wines might make me tired or something.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I drink a natural wine and I realize
they don't add sulfites to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it doesn't last a long time
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I drank a skin tone, which where they
they leave the skin on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was orange.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I never experienced that before.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, damn, we drank five
bottles.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was with my friends having a great
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't tired.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get a headache.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to know more about this.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I got a few friends that are really
really into wine.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was like, let's do a wine project.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the first one I did was called Holy
Ghost.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was from an organic wine producer,
like a fourth generation organic farm in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a pet not brought it in.
[SPEAKER_09]: We did that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I went up to Northern California
the last few years with Brock Sellers,
[SPEAKER_09]: who's a big wine producer out there who's
got a winery.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we did one called Notes and Tones.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did a jazz album along with the
wine.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I'm doing Notes and Tones,
too, which is another skin tone,
[SPEAKER_09]: orange wine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm working on that now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do it for the lifestyle, for the fun,
for the people I meet, the dinners and the
[SPEAKER_09]: travels.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the conversation, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, it's just it's just it's something
that I enjoy as a hobby.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I get to like my life is by
design.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing in my life happens by accident.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I can curate my life and what I
enjoy to do and be around great people and
[SPEAKER_09]: have good dinners and drink fucking wine,
that's what I do it for.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, any any final any less?
[SPEAKER_07]: Any last thing you want to say before we
wrap it up?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, man, I want to thank everybody for
coming out, coming to ICBC.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: Coming to Spannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody here representing the good herb.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: And bringing this shit to the forefront of
the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, let's take this shit we
wanted to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out to Alex out here and Nicole for
bringing me out here every year and being
[SPEAKER_09]: beautiful people, beautiful hosts.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank you all motherfuckers for
coming out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make some noise for yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to this man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Make some noise for my man right here,
