[SPEAKER_00]: We have a topic that I consider to be
very, very important, especially in the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of the development of the medical
cannabis market here in Europe right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, a lot of people are looking at
what's going to happen with REC and how
[SPEAKER_00]: the market's going to evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're here to talk about the medical
market and the patient experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we can't forget that with
everything that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, I'm going to start
by just giving a little intro of the
[SPEAKER_00]: gentleman's to the left of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we have Dr. Julian Wichmann
next to me, co-founder of the Bloomwell
[SPEAKER_00]: Group and also AlgeaCare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next to him, we have Berinder Bular,
Senior VP of Corporate Affairs at Brains
[SPEAKER_00]: Biaceuticals, joining us all the way from
Vancouver today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next to Berinder, we have Stefan Verbeek,
who is the president and CEO of Hello
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, also coming from Canada today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joining us out of the GTA, the greater
Toronto area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, at the end,
we have Dr. Jean-Claude Chicluna,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is the co-founder and chief science
officer of Cellotex.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gentlemen, I would like to know,
what can we do right now to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: access to medical cannabis for patients
and improve the patient journey?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do right now to make things
better for patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we should start from left to right
or whatever direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're focused obviously on Germany,
one of the largest telemedicine platforms
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's shifting towards
convenience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it needs to be much easier to be a
cannabis patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the past, we had an issue of,
I need to go to a doctor there,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I need to go to a pharmacy there,
then there's an issue, I keep going back
[SPEAKER_01]: and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's not only limiting the,
I think it's taking a lot of time for
[SPEAKER_01]: patients, I think it's frustrating for
patients, but it's also blocking people
[SPEAKER_01]: from considering becoming a cannabis
patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our focus is really invest heavily and
build up in tech and also the operations
[SPEAKER_01]: in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad to say that now in Germany,
which was unheard of before, we have
[SPEAKER_01]: through our Blue Mill Group footprint,
we have the first patients with video
[SPEAKER_01]: consultation on their phone on a Monday
and less than 24 hours, they have the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis medication in their hand and it
used to be days or not even weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the biggest challenges
right now is that there's no streamlined
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody understands what a medical patient
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you went out and talked to 50 people
and asked them to describe medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, you will probably get 50 or 60
different opinions on what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So education has to be a real key figure
here to ensure that our physicians,
[SPEAKER_05]: regulators can streamline regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because jurisdictionally, people don't
understand it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Within the country, people don't
understand it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other key is it's going to be
access.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where can I get the medicines?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to be through a specialist?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it through a regular doctor?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it through a pharmacy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have to go online and get it?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think education backed by evidence
and science is going to be huge so that
[SPEAKER_05]: regulators, physicians can feel
comfortable knowing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that education for consumers also is
going to be a huge key.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to follow up on that as well and
really reiterate the educational aspect of
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the first priorities that we did
was to start educating physicians.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, we had a very strong network
of doctors we worked with in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one by one, we were able to
communicate with them and showing real
[SPEAKER_06]: patients, not stoners, in trying to
destigmatize cannabis use as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: That type of education was able to kind of
lead a pathway for doctors to become more
[SPEAKER_06]: comfortable prescribing a narcotic that at
one point they thought turned you into a
[SPEAKER_06]: pizza eating video gamer.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's clearly not the case.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that education I think was pivotal in
being able to help increase the amount of
[SPEAKER_06]: physicians prescribing from 4% in Canada
to north of 30% in a matter of about four
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: To reiterate the second topic as well,
we need to look at actual standardization
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an interesting issue here is
because cannabis, although it is a
[SPEAKER_06]: narcotic, it is not prescribed and treated
and consumed similar to other narcotics.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Canada, we have something called a DIN,
a drug identification number, which is
[SPEAKER_06]: what's required in order to be able to
have this listed in pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So unfortunately, even though it is a
narcotic that is prescribed, the access to
[SPEAKER_06]: it has this whole separate tags of a path
that you need to walk down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not as simple as seeing a doctor
getting a prescription and going to a
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmacy and picking up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's this weird stigma that's still
there because it is treated differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we're able to educate doctors,
educate patients, and then standardize the
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine and the practice of distributing
it, treating it like everything else,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you'll see a much more rapid
expansion of medical cannabis use and
[SPEAKER_06]: access.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to think of cannabis
medicine as other medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way to improve patient outcomes is
to foster a personal relationship based on
[SPEAKER_04]: trust.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: The way we do that is we need to give
patients the time of day.
[SPEAKER_04]: The time of day to talk about a medicine
which is different from other medicines
[SPEAKER_04]: they've encountered, a type of medicine
which doesn't attack just one system in
[SPEAKER_04]: the body, it's holistic, it's organic,
and it doesn't just affect them in one
[SPEAKER_04]: part of their lives, but in many different
parts of their lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ultimately, we need to remember that
medical cannabis will have the same issues
[SPEAKER_04]: as medicine in the healthcare sector in
general.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to take possibly a different
approach, we need to look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: healthcare sector and what is happening
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've just had the pandemic,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is also in the cannabis patient's
minds of going to their doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And especially when you have a choice,
because in other aspects, if you're sick
[SPEAKER_04]: and you need a certain type of medicine,
what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to go to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: In cannabis, there's a choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go to a doctor, but I can get it
from my plug.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is the added benefit of going to
the doctor?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we need to, as clinicians and
as anyone in the industry, we need to
[SPEAKER_04]: think about the patient's point of view,
and we need to add value to making medical
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis really medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And adding that value, it takes time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a lot of time, and it needs to be
tackled in a different way from the way
[SPEAKER_04]: that medicine is being tackled currently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it needs to be patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Medicine-centric.
[SPEAKER_04]: We look at the patient, and I like how
medicine ties in with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: industry and medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a panel before this,
a great one, the one about branding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jamie said, in branding, you need to
start backwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: In cannabis, you have to start with the
consumer, see what they're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: and work backwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in medical cannabis, it's just the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to start with the patient,
see what they're like, and work backwards,
[SPEAKER_04]: not the hospital or the institution or the
clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one thing also is one of the
benefits with this active dialogue
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounding the legalization of
recreational cannabis is that one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: derivatives is that it's becoming maybe
less stigmatized slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So physicians are maybe more open to
having these conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, I don't want to discount,
and I would like to highlight the role of
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacists in this constellation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because oftentimes, the pharmacists are a
little more accessible to the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: than the physicians are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you guys mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Education, education, education.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, to improve the patient experience,
you really also have to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: physician experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Germany, it's quite complex for a
physician to prescribe medical cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of steps required,
a lot of work that needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the barriers to entry,
or let's say, the hurdles of physicians
[SPEAKER_00]: when considering to integrate medical
cannabis into their practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what can we do to tackle some of those
things so that we can increase access for
[SPEAKER_00]: the patients by making the job of the
physician easier?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to focus on some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's many more hurdles,
especially bureaucratic hurdles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say this every year, making it
easier for a doctor and a patient maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: means breaking with cannabis culture in a
way, meaning strain names, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: are, I think, important.
[SPEAKER_01]: When developing new products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a doctor, if you need to use three
lines on a prescription just for one
[SPEAKER_01]: medication, that's a hassle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're very, not only experienced,
but we're also still advocating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need simple product names.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need, as a vendor, you need a
portfolio that has an instinctive
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of what's a high grade,
what's a low intensity, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: product in those ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is a trend that is still
happening in Germany, but it's bad from a
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor's perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mean me, I mean treating
doctors in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you introduce products to the market
and you already know you're gonna take it
[SPEAKER_01]: off the market in three months,
I think that works for certain kinetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the majority of doctors,
and especially in the future market,
[SPEAKER_01]: so in a restructured market, in an RX
market, in a non-narcotic market,
[SPEAKER_01]: persistency, consistency with product
availability, product stability and
[SPEAKER_01]: quality, but also pricing in the
pharmacies is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you look at Germany,
and if you look at especially a
[SPEAKER_01]: private-insured patient self-paying
market, which is the only growing market,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's crucial to understand that even the
doctors know the prices in the pharmacies,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they look at it because it's in the
best interest of their patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's very, especially as
Jean-Claude already said, cannabis is very
[SPEAKER_01]: much different, and there's an overlap of
medicine, but also from a doctor's
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, many things are completely
new topics when you're treating patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suddenly you have to look at inventory and
prices and availability at pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the things for physicians
is we need to equip them with evidence,
[SPEAKER_05]: science and data so that they have the
confidence prescribing and they know what
[SPEAKER_05]: dosage forms they're prescribing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that only can happen if industry and
companies are providing the right
[SPEAKER_05]: compounds, the consistent API quality
active ingredients for clinical studies so
[SPEAKER_05]: that physicians do have the confidence.
[SPEAKER_05]: They know the dosages, they know where
they're going.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is a tragedy if you look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some jurisdictions in Europe, less than
10% of the registered patients are getting
[SPEAKER_05]: access to these medicines, but what's
important, I think, is to breaking it down
[SPEAKER_05]: to one, the molecule first, understanding
what the different compounds are,
[SPEAKER_05]: then having that clinical background
studied so that then the physicians have
[SPEAKER_05]: the confidence to know what they're
prescribing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, physicians will need to know,
you know, are there harms?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there side effects?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like at the end of pharmaceutical
drug, if we're going to prescribe these
[SPEAKER_05]: things, we need to know that, and the
physicians need to have the confidence to
[SPEAKER_05]: do that so that they can build trust and
continue to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are two very important points
from my perspective to increase the
[SPEAKER_05]: physician recognition of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's quite fascinating when we saw
recreational come out in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada's been a large consumer of cannabis
for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to think that outside of the
physicians, the cannabis use has been
[SPEAKER_06]: largely destigmatized in our country.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we started introducing it as a
medicine, I myself was actually quite
[SPEAKER_06]: surprised for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: A quick backstory, I'm a Dutch guy from
Vancouver, which I think are like the two
[SPEAKER_06]: largest cannabis-consuming areas in the
world, and I had never thought of this as
[SPEAKER_06]: a medicine until I suffered a very extreme
injury, and it was through a synthetic
[SPEAKER_06]: opioid addiction from post-surgery that I
discovered using cannabis as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we introduced recreational
cannabis, it kind of created this very
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting overlap between what is
medicine and what is recreational use.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll publicly admit that I am both a
medical user and a recreational user,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I do believe that there's two distinct
uses and two distinct different purposes
[SPEAKER_06]: for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: As much as there is an overlap,
I think this is something that we need to
[SPEAKER_06]: really, really, really look at here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does actually confuse a lot of
physicians when they see patients that
[SPEAKER_06]: actually are able to consume it on a
recreational side, and it does also create
[SPEAKER_06]: some confusion with respect to when
they're prescribing it as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were to look at it with respect to
an opioid, say like Dilaudid or Percocets
[SPEAKER_06]: or OxyContinin, people that use those
recreationally, there's a big stigma
[SPEAKER_06]: attached to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas there is less of a stigma with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: You would not prescribe somebody X amount
of OxyContinin knowing that they would be
[SPEAKER_06]: actually using it recreationally on top of
it, because it would, of course,
[SPEAKER_06]: mess with the regimen of what you were
prescribing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are a lot of very different
variables that a doctor needs to keep in
[SPEAKER_06]: mind with respect to cannabis use and
prescribing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll follow up with what Jean-Claude
said as well, is there certainly does need
[SPEAKER_06]: to be a holistic approach.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is not exactly throwing a monkey
wrench in the system, but it is most
[SPEAKER_06]: certainly changing the pathway to a system
that doctors have been very, very,
[SPEAKER_06]: very streamlined doing, where they look
at, say, body weight, appetite,
[SPEAKER_06]: severity of pain, all of these different
variables, and then they fix a number and
[SPEAKER_06]: a narcotic attached to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a certain degree of mathematics
and systems that have checks and balances
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, that's for accountability,
two, not to kill people, and three,
[SPEAKER_06]: which also save a doctor's license as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there needs to be these checks and
balances.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you look at something holistic,
there is no two people that are the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way that people interact with the
cannabinoids, it's completely different as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you start looking at all these
different synthetic narcotics,
[SPEAKER_06]: it is far more predictable how the body is
going to interact with these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, what people don't understand is that
if I have had a full meal in me and 10
[SPEAKER_06]: hours of sleep, five milligrams of
Dilaudid is going to affect me a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: differently than if I had five milligrams
of Dilaudid with very little to eat,
[SPEAKER_06]: very little sleep, and a lot of stress.
[SPEAKER_06]: You metabolize these narcotics
differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think in full circle, we do need to
take a lot more accountability for
[SPEAKER_06]: physicians and patients to have a more
holistic approach and recognize that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: prescribing something that's going to be a
moving target.
[SPEAKER_06]: No matter what, people metabolize
narcotics differently, they react to
[SPEAKER_06]: narcotics differently, and this does need
to be a pathway that needs to be
[SPEAKER_06]: ever-changing, ever-adapting, and just
like our human bodies are.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is certainly no easy task,
but I do believe that an organic holistic
[SPEAKER_06]: approach, again, an esteemed colleague of
mine was commenting on this too,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's more work, but I think it's going to
save the world from a lot more opioid
[SPEAKER_06]: addictions going forward, a lot more
misuse of narcotics, and I do believe that
[SPEAKER_06]: we'll have a much more healthy society if
we're able to start educating people on
[SPEAKER_06]: how to be able to react to different
narcotics, on how to be able to understand
[SPEAKER_06]: what their bodies and their minds are
doing when they are using these narcotics,
[SPEAKER_06]: and educate a doctor on how to be able to
safely educate patients on using these
[SPEAKER_06]: narcotics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, and just to follow up,
I really like the point Bander said about
[SPEAKER_04]: data, and about how data is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is, and this is maybe a
challenge that we have nowadays,
[SPEAKER_04]: we have so much data coming into
physicians, and we have to remember,
[SPEAKER_04]: in medical school, what are you trained
on?
[SPEAKER_04]: In medical school, you're trained to use
this analog stethoscope, these analog
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff, but then you go into real practice,
and you have a computer, and all you're
[SPEAKER_04]: seeing is data sets, data sets,
data sets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimately, we need to find a way to help
the doctors turn those data sets into
[SPEAKER_04]: actionable insights.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take actions, and based on what you're
seeing, you understand it, and you know
[SPEAKER_04]: what prescription, or what move,
or what's the next clinical judgment
[SPEAKER_04]: decision you need to take in the best
interest of your patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it gets so complex, like Stephen
said, it can get so complex, so you need
[SPEAKER_04]: to be ever-adjusting, you need to be
dynamic.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to ultimately give doctors the
ability, not only when they're seeing the
[SPEAKER_04]: patient, but also after that, to monitor
their patient and see continuously what is
[SPEAKER_04]: happening on many different spheres.
[SPEAKER_04]: We mentioned being holistic, so it's not
just about what is happening on a,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe whether they're feeling good or not
feeling good, but we need to have
[SPEAKER_04]: biological data, we need to have data sets
which can tell us exactly what is
[SPEAKER_04]: happening in your body.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimately, just like Stephen said,
when we start getting this right,
[SPEAKER_04]: the floodgates are open.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're doing, and I think it's
interesting, being in the cannabis space,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're already getting one thing right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first tick box is already there,
because I think one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_04]: problems in mainstream healthcare is the
rigidity not to explore these new things.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that patients like most
about any cannabis clinic, or any clinic
[SPEAKER_04]: which is offering their alternative
medicine is, I'm getting an alternative.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the old days, even asking for an
alternative, and you were shooed away from
[SPEAKER_04]: the clinic.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about this kind of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have clinics which are actually
offering professional guidance for
[SPEAKER_04]: alternative therapies.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is already something which we're
doing really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this is a big statement,
but I think that what we do in cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine will send shockwaves across
medicine in general, because we're taking
[SPEAKER_04]: a different approach, and we're starting
with what the patient wants.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the patient wants to know about
alternative therapies in a scientific way,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we're there to provide it,
this will really have a big change,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we can do a lot for doctors,
for doctors' warrants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if we want to get more doctors
to be prescribing, you need to be safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first got into cannabis medicine,
I did very early, so I got this illusion
[SPEAKER_04]: very early from the hospital setting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely in my grade, in my year,
I was the first doctor to venture out
[SPEAKER_04]: privately, do alternative medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I meet my friends in bars, and I can tell
you a lot of young doctors, we certainly
[SPEAKER_04]: use cannabis, and we use, and a lot of
doctors know the science, so it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: taught in schools, and there's no
education, true, but doctors are
[SPEAKER_04]: inquisitive people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We research, we want to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And many doctors, they say, you know,
it's not that I don't believe in it when I
[SPEAKER_04]: ask them, you know, come on, join me,
join my clinic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool, and they say, I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm scared for my warrant, it took me
seven years, you know, and a kidney to get
[SPEAKER_04]: here, and I'm not ready to go out and lose
it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to give doctors, like we said,
the confidence to go ahead and change the
[SPEAKER_04]: world for the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what's unique to the cannabis
industry is that, as you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, teachings about the
endocannabinoid system of the plant are
[SPEAKER_00]: not part of the traditional medical
school, so the onus falls on us as an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry to educate the physicians or
fight to have this kind of curriculum
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced to medical schools around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: As somebody that has spent years in the
field here in Germany, visiting hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: of physicians, I can tell you,
it's difficult as a pharma rep or as a
[SPEAKER_00]: company to be the one to help a physician
take that first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to hear it from other
physicians, they need to hear it from
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists, they need to hear the data,
like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to just touch on the point that
you made, Julian, about the bureaucracy
[SPEAKER_00]: that's tied to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was visiting physicians,
really the one thing that convinced many
[SPEAKER_00]: of them to actually consider implementing
cannabis was a tool that I was introducing
[SPEAKER_00]: them to that digitized the entire
reimbursement process, and I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a great way of developing tech to ease the
burden on the physicians and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: increase access, and I'm joined here by a
number of industry colleagues that are
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing tech in a number of very
different ways, so perhaps you could touch
[SPEAKER_00]: on the role that tech plays right now in
making cannabis more accessible,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also with the recent innovations and,
you know, technology such as AI and ML,
[SPEAKER_00]: where is the integration of technology
heading to further develop this market and
[SPEAKER_00]: make the access for patients more
streamlined?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we always look at it primarily
from an operational perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: so where our potential hiccups in the
patient journey, because again,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's not only frustrating,
but keeping people away or actually having
[SPEAKER_01]: them leave treatment, because they're
basically saying, hey, this is just too
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before, I was used to getting prescription
and picking up on the next corner that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't work in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are very much data focused and in a way
of, you know, having data from all these
[SPEAKER_01]: access points, so from doctors and their
notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a radiologist originally, so I come
from structure reporting, machine readable
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with the patients and prescriptions
and also the pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting, I think, looking at
data, it's crucial to zoom out more,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we look at data from more than 100
doctors and we use that data to educate
[SPEAKER_01]: them, because my personal experience in
general medicine, but also in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, is that doctors overestimate
their personal data that they collect and
[SPEAKER_01]: never step outside that and then start to
realize, okay, I could have treated that
[SPEAKER_01]: patient differently and the outcome would
have been better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just finished first university
collaboration operations, first paper
[SPEAKER_01]: being accepted, and we saw as a
consequence of focus on operational focus,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's where we invest a lot into tech
and operations in the pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the patients, in the app, for doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a better outcome, so our thesis
is really, if you have a better
[SPEAKER_01]: operational experience, your medical
outcome will be impacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just about the medication itself,
it's about the journey along the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: and obviously, we're getting into a
direction of using the data not only to
[SPEAKER_01]: educate doctors, patients, pharmacists,
but also making data-based suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you plug terpene profiles
into that equation, into the algorithm,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have all the data available from
an analysis, so medical history of that
[SPEAKER_01]: patient, certain contraindications,
certain indications, then you become very
[SPEAKER_01]: good at predicting not only is medical
cannabis a good fit for that patient,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also which type.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the, I think, in German pharmacies,
up to 200 different strains, that makes a
[SPEAKER_01]: big impact there, and then you can plug
that in, because even the doctors,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a lot of knowledge, are asking for
how can I treat my patient based on
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profiles and not just THC,
CBD ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Innovation, I think, is going to be key
for the sector.
[SPEAKER_05]: Innovation combined with combination
products, I think, is just going to be the
[SPEAKER_05]: future, but looking at things like how do
we enhance bioavailability how do we
[SPEAKER_05]: enhance solubility, how do we enhance
stability, how do we get targeted
[SPEAKER_05]: formulations out there, and that's
something us at BrainsBio, with our
[SPEAKER_05]: partners DSM for Amnesia, really focused
on on the next horizon, and going beyond
[SPEAKER_05]: just CBD as the golden child, looking at
CBN, CBC, major and minor cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding what we can do, and coming
out with targeted formulations is going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be really key to the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: One area that really excites me also is
sports science.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we take all of our learnings,
our clinical studies, and look at sports
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrition enhancement?
[SPEAKER_05]: Athletes travel a lot, we know that,
sleep is a big problem for them,
[SPEAKER_05]: inflammation is a big problem for them,
so how do we work on performance
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrition, and that is what innovation is
going to bring to this, but also,
[SPEAKER_05]: innovation is what's going to help
continue to bring down the stigma.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we can bring in new dosage forms,
when we can bring in dosage forms that are
[SPEAKER_05]: more acceptable, other than flour and
oils, for people, that's going to help
[SPEAKER_05]: bring down the stigma, and it's going to
be huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think innovation and combination
products is something that I'm really
[SPEAKER_05]: looking forward to in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting when we're looking at a
holistic organic product and trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: incorporate technology into this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one thing that's rather
interesting, when you think of holistic
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine, something that I've heard many,
many interesting stories from JC over
[SPEAKER_06]: here, and I urge you to spend some time
with him, hearing about his travels.
[SPEAKER_06]: Incorporating technology into these types
of original traditional medicines is a big
[SPEAKER_06]: jump, because you're looking at two polar
opposites of the situation here.
[SPEAKER_06]: One instance where we found that we could
introduce technology without disrupting
[SPEAKER_06]: the actual natural course that this
medicine has traditionally been used for,
[SPEAKER_06]: and where I found it has been most
beneficial, is with respect to actually
[SPEAKER_06]: using tech for accessibility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not necessarily using tech to alter how
you consume, or how the product interacts
[SPEAKER_06]: with your body, but more or less using
tech to be able to help with access.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, Hello Cannabis was actually the
very first clinic to be able to offer to
[SPEAKER_06]: be accepted into the OTN.
[SPEAKER_06]: The OTN is the Ontario Telehealth Network.
[SPEAKER_06]: What this allowed was for doctors to be
able to prescribe cannabis through a video
[SPEAKER_06]: conference call.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was something that had tremendously
helped our access, because once again,
[SPEAKER_06]: there were only 4% of physicians that were
prescribing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quite a few of those were actually working
with us at one point, and it allowed us to
[SPEAKER_06]: be able to spread the access and be able
to actually have them meet patients from
[SPEAKER_06]: around the province, which is rather
large, I believe larger than Germany by
[SPEAKER_06]: size, and be able to increase access.
[SPEAKER_06]: When a pandemic happened, of course that
technology was no longer useful,
[SPEAKER_06]: because everybody had access to video.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I do find is when we're able to
incorporate technology that's going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: able to benefit a holistic and organic
approach to a medication, to a traditional
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine, I think you can find a happy
sweet spot there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that cannabis needs to
necessarily be going down a future tech
[SPEAKER_06]: hole, but I do believe that we do need to
see some form of standardization with this
[SPEAKER_06]: product, a lot more consistency in
utilizing technology for data,
[SPEAKER_06]: utilizing technology for education,
utilizing data and technology for
[SPEAKER_06]: accessibility.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do truly think that you can find a way
to be able to harbor the future and have
[SPEAKER_06]: it work cohesively and collaborate with
the past of traditional holistic medicine,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we can finally be able to get the best
of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we are getting to the
Terminator future with everything becoming
[SPEAKER_06]: very standardized and pill form.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think that we need to hold on to
traditional holistic medical routes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have found that as somebody that has a
very strong daily regimen of medications
[SPEAKER_06]: required for chronic injuries,
the traditional holistic route certainly
[SPEAKER_06]: allows me to be able to function and
operate at my highest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every other synthetic form, I have found
that it has actually been an inebriation,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it has also been something that has
kind of put me slower and unable to be
[SPEAKER_06]: able to perform at my highest ability.
[SPEAKER_06]: So finding the balance between technology
and a holistic traditional, using
[SPEAKER_06]: technology and have that harbor with a
traditional holistic medication,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're going to be able to see a
strong, successful program with respect to
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, no doctor's ever going to
prescribe something that you can,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, let me rephrase that, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: A doctor will very rarely condone and
prescribe something that you are going to
[SPEAKER_06]: combust and smoke in your lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems to be something that everybody
here can agree on, I hope.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that being said, there is also
something, it is also an extremely fast
[SPEAKER_06]: and effective and controlled way to be
able to get this medication into your
[SPEAKER_06]: system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have been able to find ways and use
technology to be able to actually isolate
[SPEAKER_06]: the amount of cannabinoids that are coming
in, and we have found different ways in
[SPEAKER_06]: order to be able to use this holistic
medicine without having the subjectivity
[SPEAKER_06]: and irregularity of how much narcotic
you're introducing into your body by
[SPEAKER_06]: utilizing some of this technology as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's still kind of a weird faux pas
when you start talking about high tech in
[SPEAKER_06]: the future with a very traditional
holistic medication, but there is a
[SPEAKER_06]: balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my personal belief is that technology
should be used in other areas outside of
[SPEAKER_06]: the actual innovation to be able to have
the medication.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use that technology to be able to help
with data sets, to be able to help with
[SPEAKER_06]: education, to be able to help with
destigmatization, to be able to help with
[SPEAKER_06]: accessibility.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, don't mess with something if it
isn't broke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis is not a broken medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It works.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think we need to really take
this to the future and have this into a
[SPEAKER_06]: totally synthesized structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Having a DIN number would certainly help
access and it would certainly help
[SPEAKER_06]: destigmatize and get more doctors on
board.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just as JC made a very strong
counterpoint to what I was saying before,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe it's going, taking a
unholistic approach to any form of
[SPEAKER_06]: medication is the answer as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at Celltex, what we do is we use
biological data from an individual to
[SPEAKER_04]: assess and measure what is happening in an
individual's body when using plant
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to take plant medicine out of the
shadows, out of this voodoo medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: shadows which we're not comfortable with,
mainstream doctors aren't comfortable
[SPEAKER_04]: with, and try to give them data from which
they can make insights.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can take insights out of that and
make, like we said, actionable decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like Stephen is saying, it's not just
about using it to measure biological data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something we learned really early on is
the tech is really a solution all across
[SPEAKER_04]: for different aspects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Stephen mentioned some.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll mention another with regards to
insurance.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've spoken about bureaucracy and how
tech can help that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned that tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll mention another, staff shortage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Healthcare is going through one of the
biggest staff shortages ever since the
[SPEAKER_04]: pandemic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know there are lots of people from
North America here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some numbers from there that even
though 8% of all healthcare jobs are open
[SPEAKER_04]: at this point, we still have 400,000 less
people working in healthcare in North
[SPEAKER_04]: America.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the same thing is in Europe and
wherever I've gone, it's always doctors
[SPEAKER_04]: are overworked, doctors are overtired.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you remember, jars with what I
started with of giving patients the time
[SPEAKER_04]: of the day to encourage and foster that
personal relationship and foster that
[SPEAKER_04]: trust.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think tech can play a role here.
[SPEAKER_04]: By encouraging the patients to use tech
and engage with tech, we can foster that
[SPEAKER_04]: personal relationship through tech despite
the shortage of staff that we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, it's about finding solutions
for the different problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the most important thing,
because it's an easy sell, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Finding solutions to problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we need to make sure that we're
targeting all the stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we're developing tech,
let's not just think about tech for
[SPEAKER_04]: patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's think of tech for everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tech also for the industry to be able
to allocate resources because,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, let's think of tech for the
pharmacists to be able to follow up,
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to see is their medicine
working well, are there any changes,
[SPEAKER_04]: lies with the doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ultimately, I also believe that we
need to look at data.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go back there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to look at data differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like care has gone from
institution-centric to patient-centric,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's the same thing with data.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to empower patients because it is
empowering to own their own medical data.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the last time you needed a
scan or something, but I needed a scan
[SPEAKER_04]: once from my hospital and you needed to go
to customer care and wait two hours and
[SPEAKER_04]: have that burnt on a CD-ROM, as if anyone
still uses those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it made me think that patients really
don't have access to their medical data.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, do you have access to the data,
to maybe a CT scan you had when you were
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 years old?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but it's your data.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the patient's data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think tech can really serve to
democratize data for patients because once
[SPEAKER_04]: you empower patients to have that medical
data about themselves, then they can be
[SPEAKER_04]: the ones, and we talked about this going
backwards and starting with the patient,
[SPEAKER_04]: they can be the ones to go to the other
stakeholders, to the industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: to the pharmacy, to the doctors,
and tell them, this is my data.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to share it with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like you to help me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to add value as a clinician,
as a pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And finally, this is the product that I
want.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the product that works for my
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just like to add on to that,
too, that tech can also help in the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of data that's collected from
consumers, especially now when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizers, for example, that are
connected to IoT to basically have
[SPEAKER_00]: immediate data transfer on the usage of
different medicines to alleviate any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of risk in the quality of data that you
collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we didn't touch on this yet,
but I think that machine learning and AI
[SPEAKER_00]: and even blockchain in some instances are
going to be absolutely crucial in
[SPEAKER_00]: expediting the process of finished
pharmaceutical drug development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have hundreds of products on
the market in Germany and only two
[SPEAKER_00]: products that are actually market
authorized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think tech is going to be absolutely
crucial in developing these market
[SPEAKER_00]: authorized finished pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to take
the last seven and a half minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: or this opportunity, first of all,
to see if anyone in the audience has any
[SPEAKER_00]: questions for the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, let's hear it for the panel.
Yay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're also young and smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: My man Javier over here ran over.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, are they going to take
questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a very important question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Javier, what was your question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick question.
[SPEAKER_03]: As an introduction, I'm a recreational
user that takes a lot of cannabis every
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the same time, I'm a breather.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a partnership with some legendary
breathers from Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that I notice,
because I'm very sensitive to the effect
[SPEAKER_03]: of what this thing does, because I also
consume other psychedelics as a medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: way, not recreational, is that a lot of
the land, some of the strains that we
[SPEAKER_03]: produce that are closer to the land race
cultivars, they're not as potent,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they give you a steady result.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my question is, is there anybody
working on figuring out if all this
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking up with genetics that we're doing
to try to provide the nice little terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: taste to the kids in California,
is messing up the medical industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: And is there room for the ones that we
still, for the last 20 years, we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping those clones and having weed that
apparently is not desirable anymore?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there room for a different type of
breathing only for the medical business?
[SPEAKER_06]: Steven?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you don't mind, I got to tackle
this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an unbelievable question and one
that I've taken as a personal journey as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: My original hobby, being a Dutch guy from
Vancouver and being exposed to cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: since I've been, like growers since I've
been this tall, was actually cultivation
[SPEAKER_06]: and genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interestingly enough, I actually had the
privilege to be traveling the world trying
[SPEAKER_06]: to discover some of these land race
strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, I'm wearing a pendant which
was a gift from the Queen of Bhutan,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is a country in between India and
China where we were traveling in the
[SPEAKER_06]: Himalayan mountains discovering land race
strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we talk about land races and how
when we start catering and breeding and
[SPEAKER_06]: changing things for like different candy
for kids and whatnot, let's look at dogs
[SPEAKER_06]: for example, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a miniature pincer, like that is a
dog that I'm not even sure has a brain,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it doesn't even know its own name.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you start really genetically
modifying things to the point where you
[SPEAKER_06]: are taking quote the best of one thing or
quote the best of another thing and
[SPEAKER_06]: continually breeding and manipulating
them, you do genuinely lose the soul.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm using that word very frivolously,
but I hope everybody in the audience can
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of follow what I'm meaning by that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You definitely lose the potent,
the land race strains certainly do not
[SPEAKER_06]: have the potency, which is what all of
these breeding programs have been trying
[SPEAKER_06]: to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the most important thing that they
have been losing is the actual medical
[SPEAKER_06]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have found that land race strains have
certainly had a far stronger entourage
[SPEAKER_06]: effect and cannabinoid effect with respect
to holistic medical therapy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do believe that the further we can,
we are manipulating these land race
[SPEAKER_06]: strains, the further away we are getting,
the further we are getting away from an
[SPEAKER_06]: actual holistic original medical approach
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the balance between that's going to be
very interesting and yes, I do believe
[SPEAKER_06]: that we need to pay homage to some of the
original land races and the growers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd love to talk to you about some of
the programs that are there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, introducing that type of stuff
to doctors is going to be extremely
[SPEAKER_06]: challenging again, because of the organic
aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of these land race strains are
consumed by combustion, which is not
[SPEAKER_06]: exactly something that's condoned by
doctors very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very big moving target and one that
I think you and I should have a private
[SPEAKER_06]: chat over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to add something small, that was bang
on the mark, Stephen, great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to add this note to all the audience,
however long humans have been playing with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis genetics, the land races have
been evolving with humans for hundreds of
[SPEAKER_04]: thousands of years, for millennia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that isn't the most, I think nature
has been playing around with genetics much
[SPEAKER_04]: longer than anyone else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions from the audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple more minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wait, I had a question, but I forgot
it because I hit some hash while you were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was because you were talking about the,
so as we've been evolving with weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've been evolving with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you call some of these new weeds
like a junk food or would you say that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just further evolution because young
people like sweeter things and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everything tastes like a dessert.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the old heads are always like,
bring back the weed that tastes like feet
[SPEAKER_02]: and cheese and burnt tires and a skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all the kids are like, we like the
Skittles and the candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When was the last time you had a coffee
flavored weed or a wine flavored weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you say that's just part of the
evolution or would you say that it's more
[SPEAKER_02]: of a bastardization?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it depends on what you're doing
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of the day, it's medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's recreational, then whatever tastes
fine is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's medical, the human body is the
way it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it changes very slowly and it doesn't
adapt as fast as modern society or
[SPEAKER_04]: especially not as fast as the industry
changes and adapts.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whenever we come up with new strengths,
especially I think in the medical sector,
[SPEAKER_04]: we need to keep that in mind that if
something is new and we're going too far
[SPEAKER_04]: away from what is natural, we need to keep
in mind that there's a question mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying it's bad, but we need to
remember that we don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're just always saying to
challenge why is it recreational versus
[SPEAKER_01]: medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at data from the US,
you see that in the recreational market,
[SPEAKER_01]: 45% of people actually self-medicate and
they're not fully aware.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when anybody says, say this is reckoned
as medical, I always ask why is it
[SPEAKER_01]: reckoned and what are you doing in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then suddenly they start to say,
well I'm sleeping better, I have less
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are medical indications and that's
also from a doctorate challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as Steven also said, to be open
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ask those questions, but suddenly you
see patients uneducated about their own
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know a single cannabis consumer
that says I do it because I like getting
[SPEAKER_06]: messed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes I like to be high as hell.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's totally fair, but I believe that
there's a medical reason that you are
[SPEAKER_06]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was probably sad.
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a perfect example right here
where that is self-medicating,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: All cannabis uses medical use according to
the late great Dennis Perrone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would say all cannabis uses medical
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are unfortunately out of time,
but that was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it again for this fantastic
panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
