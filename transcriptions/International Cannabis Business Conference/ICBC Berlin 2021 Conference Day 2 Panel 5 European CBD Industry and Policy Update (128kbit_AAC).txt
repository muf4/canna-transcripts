[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about CBD today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, here's the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge thing in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is not news at all, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is neither is the fact that
regulation in the German-European market
[SPEAKER_01]: is still a bloody mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're gonna do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're gonna do today is we're gonna
look for an update.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, where are we standing at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we heading for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really, really happy to have like
three great experts sitting here to join
[SPEAKER_01]: the panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, the first one is Jakub Megavita.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the managing director of VIAVATE and
director of medical of the SEMTI Group.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the biggest, biggest, yeah,
superstar companies in civilians,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we can say that this here.
[SPEAKER_01]: As is the Basan Kankor, who is the
co-founder and CEO of Mechanics,
[SPEAKER_01]: also here in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bosztyn Janiszak.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the managing director of,
sorry, chief technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Director of Parmian in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're combining expertise from
medical, consumer care, and technical
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint, which will make very great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we standing at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it as short as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that the market's still growing and
growing, but there's big confusion about
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give us a little overview?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are we standing with the market at
the moment?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's challenging at the moment,
because we find ourselves confronted with
[SPEAKER_03]: three different levels of regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the regional level here in
Germany, where we fight to understand the
[SPEAKER_03]: interpretation of goals by regional
authorities.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as the implementation.
[SPEAKER_03]: How strict are they looking at it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is really very different in
different areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on your local authority how
strictly this is implemented.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're looking to the German government
and say, okay, we would like to see a
[SPEAKER_03]: clear regulation for CBD that allows us to
bring safe products directly to the
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the response of the German government
has been pointing towards the USA case.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about food.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a national issue.
This is a European Union issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which doesn't make it very easy for them
to say this is not really our problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the European Union level.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there are German regulations like
the amount of GHC that is allowed over the
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just recently, just in the last days,
there's been a recall of hemp products by
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the biggest retailers in Germany,
which is D-Build, who had to recall it
[SPEAKER_03]: back because of two highest GHC levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there is an interaction behind this
discussion before about hemp production
[SPEAKER_03]: and the GHC levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go into this.
So, thank you to the European Union on
this level.
And before we see it, we see it's not a
food.
You have to apply for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a long process.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of things aren't clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we're looking to the European Union to
have better regulations on that level.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it is extremely difficult to
lobby for regulations within the European
[SPEAKER_03]: Union unless it comes from a specific
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: The country has an interest to regulate
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It puts together for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not seeing this at the moment that
this is one country that's really driving
[SPEAKER_03]: the policies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in this field, you have to figure out,
can I bring out safe products and
[SPEAKER_03]: cosmetics?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the difference between cosmetics
and food supplement?
Is food supplement possible at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it all another food?
[SPEAKER_03]: If I cannot bring out another food,
how much leeway do we need?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have on the regional level,
until I have a market for another food,
[SPEAKER_03]: how much leeway do I have on the regional
level to actually bring the product out
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe under a certain different level?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is the whole picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where we're playing on those three
fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very difficult to navigate as a
company through those fields because you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to look at all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you obviously saw, there are a lot of
different technical and legal aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you mentioned, it's a big issue still
to talk about the 0.2% THC thresholds that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have for CV products in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: It leads to a lot of very rare cases in
the German market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I would first like to ask you a
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your view on that from a technical
point of view?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you said it leads to some sort of
insecurities, overregulation in the
[SPEAKER_01]: market, what are the repercussions of
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing you need to know is what
the concentration of THC in your sample
product is.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we need is a common integration that
would prescribe the proper methods for the
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: One way to go is to use the existing ISO
standardization for the laboratories.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if the Obama laboratory is accredited
according to ISO 1725 standard,
[SPEAKER_02]: then this laboratory is a laboratory that
you believe.
So, basically, one, first, every product
needs to be analyzed and credited to the
laboratory.
You need to take the measurement
uncertainties into consideration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this product becomes viable for
the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically, what we need here is a
unified view of the analytical processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I can tell you from my experience that
when you analyze samples in the
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratories across Europe, even much
worse in the United States, you get a
range of results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's say we would have a sample that
would be clear.
The highest number would be .17 that our
quality control would still get through.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, I can send it to a couple of
labs that would show .22 of THC.
So, taking into consideration the 15%
uncertainty, which is at that
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration, basically, you shouldn't
put anything on the market which is above
[SPEAKER_02]: .17.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically, what we get is the range of
numbers from .22 to .11.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is something that needs to be
considered when you put your products to
[SPEAKER_02]: the market or when you buy the products.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big mess in the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I say accreditation, so there's
ISO 1.1725 of the division for the
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's touch the certificates a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, like Jan mentioned, there's a
mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's continue with the mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, when you go to the market,
people will say, okay, we have GMP
[SPEAKER_02]: certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even worse, the Americans would say we
have CGMP, which means current GMP.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's C in front of the GMP.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what exactly does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this GMP refer to?
So, let's take it from the beginning.
So, you can have a, if you're a producer
of cosmetic products, you can have the ISO
[SPEAKER_02]: 22.617, I think it's called,
certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is called GMP Good Manufacturing
Practices for Cosmetic Products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you can be honest and say,
I have GMP for cosmetic products,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is basically an ISO 22.
[SPEAKER_02]: 716.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you can get that certificate,
you can get awarded the certificate by
[SPEAKER_02]: several companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is SGS, for instance, the other is
BLMS.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is one GMP that you can be
dealing with in the cannabis business.
The second, one step further, is basically
the Good Manufacturing Practical Process
[SPEAKER_02]: for Certification Board.
[SPEAKER_02]: For food supplements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is the next step.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, now we have two GMPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you can ask your provider with what
type of the GMP.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one for the cosmetics or the one for
the food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, then there's an ISO certification
for the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is all in the business for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't need to be invented for
cannabis.
So, it exists.
So, basically, then we can, what everybody
would like to have and what everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: would like to advertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: The final GMP is the GMP that is connected
to the active pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as you know, last year, German
Pharmacopoeia, Deutsches Asseibuch,
[SPEAKER_02]: published a monograph on standardized
cannabis expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this automatically means that all
European medicines agencies can approve
[SPEAKER_02]: production of API from the cannabis
expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rules are simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it has to have THC content between one
and 25, and CBT content whatever is
[SPEAKER_02]: standardized plus minus 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically, this is the real GMP.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for this GMP, you need ISO rate
premises and the whole flow of materials
[SPEAKER_02]: and people who's standardized according to
the rules of European medicine agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what I want to say is this is most
common in cannabis business because
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody wants to say we are GMP
certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the message here is, check what kind
of GMP the provider is offering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe to start with, for the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll think about another point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to make it more complicated
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, I mean, all this kind of
regulation, let me be frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started with this analytical issues of
THC thresholds and CBT products,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and you've been talking about
certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, doesn't it render it kind of
useless considering that we are working
[SPEAKER_01]: with different thresholds in different
countries and CBT debates to change those
[SPEAKER_01]: thresholds, for example, as they're going
on in Czech Republic or Poland?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, doesn't that also have some pretty
serious repercussions for producers?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, in Germany, you get their
commodities from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what do you think about Sebastian?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what effects do you see from that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when it comes to, like,
for example, farming and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're an extractive company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we have just one quality which is
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some biomass from our farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only use UD varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seeds that you'll be farmers can
use a ratio of about 1 to 35 THC density.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as long as the limit is 0.2%,
as this property, you get, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you go up to 0.15, you get a CBT
concentration of maximum 3, 4,
[SPEAKER_00]: 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have the threshold of 0.2 lifted
up to 1%, you can get 5 times more CBT in
[SPEAKER_00]: the biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomass is paid by the concentration of
CBT.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, as an extractive company,
a fixed cost doesn't matter if it's 3% or
[SPEAKER_00]: 5% or 10% CBT.
[SPEAKER_00]: And starting from somewhere, you have
profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, our aim is to buy biomass
as high concentration of CBT as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the THC concentration limits
the biomass difference, countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain countries, will not be able to
offer in the future farmers the
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility to sell and buy biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, like here, located in Berlin,
Poland is about 1.5 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Czech Republic is about 2 hours,
12 hours, 5 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Munich is 5 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: If in Poland, the Czech Republic,
the limit will be lifted to 1%,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will buy from farmers in the Czech
Republic and in Poland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the consumer doesn't have,
like, a limit from where the biomass comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's looking to the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is really an important issue that
we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the same limits, and as you
have heard earlier from politicians,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't matter if it's 0.2% or 0.6% or
1%, but then I would go with 1% because it
[SPEAKER_00]: is for us, as European producers,
the possibility to also compete with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans and Canadians who are not
bounded to the capital of European
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their varieties is then 50% or 20% of
CBT, so pricing should be always much more
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like you're calling for
harmonization of the European regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this said, I remember a union once
telling me that you consider those calls
[SPEAKER_01]: for the European Union, harmonization of
the European Union regulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be kind of like pre-tax stuff that is
already used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you think so?
[SPEAKER_03]: We can wish for a lot of things on
harmonization.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is how it's going to be
implemented.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, yes, yes, I see from an industry
point of view, what can you do as an
[SPEAKER_03]: industry to get into this dialogue?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there have been some good
examples here in Berlin and Germany to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually actively engage in discussion as
an industry to organize itself as an
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, of course, AIDA on the European
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing a good job on the European
level at supporting the novel food
[SPEAKER_03]: applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very important if you use Germany to
be in contact with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even generally, there are several new
groups that are dealing with this problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an initiative that's called OZBK,
which is organizing the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is also the Cannabis Business
Industry Association from Jürgen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's important that we as an industry,
we're not against regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a misunderstanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's very important to have a
clear framework to know exactly how aware
[SPEAKER_03]: the waters are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's some good suggestions,
for example, that we want to harmonize
[SPEAKER_03]: testing or methods within the company to
also show the certificates openly that I
[SPEAKER_03]: can see for every batch that has been
tested, that the consumer and other
authorities can check this at any time.
Those are things that industry can do.
And I think that's still not going to
change you if you use a new regulation.
This is very tricky, but it's going to
help to do this on a global level.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last initiative I want to point out,
which I find quite interesting,
[SPEAKER_03]: is Berlin Partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Berlin Partners is a public-private
partnership to support companies in
[SPEAKER_03]: Berlin, to settle down in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_03]: They recently found a cannabis group for
cannabis companies and trying to make this
[SPEAKER_03]: dialogue between the local authority or
trying to make dialogue between the local
[SPEAKER_03]: authorities and the companies to actually
discuss those issues and try to find out
[SPEAKER_03]: how we can implement consumer protection
in a way that everybody's satisfied.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think this is the main point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulation should be always about consumer
protection.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think with the whole discussion we had
so far about
[SPEAKER_03]: is it cosmetics?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it not a food?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a food supplement?
[SPEAKER_03]: But the main focus should be the question,
is this effective consumer protection?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the more complicated it gets
with regulation, the more companies are
[SPEAKER_03]: forced for loopholes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is counterproductive for consumer
protection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clear regulation, clear rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the industry is not against it,
but it should be practical.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be looking at millions of
consumers who are doing this one way or
[SPEAKER_03]: another with a safe product or without a
safe product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a good dialogue that we
have actively engaged in and not wait for
[SPEAKER_03]: the miracle to happen that something's
going to happen on national or European
[SPEAKER_03]: level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never bet on changing regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we go into the active dialogue here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's for cosmetics and also for the
production of food supplements,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not from hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not containing CBD because the
entity will not issue the certificate as
[SPEAKER_02]: long as there's another food capital out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically we do everything under the
GMP conditions, but we don't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: certificate for the hemp, which Americans
can't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this speech about consumer protection,
it means all the products of CBD that are
[SPEAKER_00]: sold as cosmetics because you're not
allowed to sell food supplements here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not allowed to sell flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: All cosmetics, there's no regulation for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot even certify, you cannot show
that all products are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have temporary regulations in the
European Union and in the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_00]: like there are certain toxic solvents
which are used in the U.S., which are not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed on the European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one is looking after them because it's
a food supplement from a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint, and therefore there's no
regulation as a result of a product which
[SPEAKER_00]: is marketed for the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's more attention for what
everyone wants, also the authorities,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the way that they handle it or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Jan said, the industry is really up
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say, okay, why don't we set up an
internet page, a web page, so authorities
[SPEAKER_00]: can proactively look at it, and every
product he has produced, a brain on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market, he uploads the COEs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's any question about it,
look for us on that page and you'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: some information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very fast, unambiguated way how
we as an industry can support authorities
[SPEAKER_00]: with the status and also with products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I can follow up on the zero point,
too, in plants, if you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we know, the European Board of
Justice, to be at CBD, has to be in their
[SPEAKER_02]: coffee class here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, I don't know about the
German legislation or any other,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Slovenian legislation says that you
can cultivate plants from the European
[SPEAKER_02]: source list as long as they have less than
.2% in dried biomass, which means the
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass should not contain between eight
and 12% of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, this is what you can
cultivate, and there's no other law
[SPEAKER_02]: regarding CBD or hemp, in Slovenia,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's similar across Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, when CBD is clear by the European
Board of Justice, what prevents you to
[SPEAKER_02]: import biomass from the United States?
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you can keep what Europe now
considers, even though the law is not set,
[SPEAKER_02]: now it considers to be about just 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is mainly good news for some
extraction companies, but not so good news
[SPEAKER_02]: for European farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, this is a loophole that you
were talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the loopholes is if CBD is not
correct, then you can import biomass.
Well, since I don't want to repeat my
understanding from the last panel,
[SPEAKER_01]: just keeping everybody talking as much as
I love it, then we still have to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: space for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would really like to finish with some
kind of sum up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think, given the obvious lack of
harmonized regulatory frameworks in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe, that some kind of self-regulation
within the European, within Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: is superior to lobbying for state
regulation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should the industry just be more active
and show more initiative to improve and
[SPEAKER_01]: more implement, in the first place,
self-regulation?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that, for example, ProCBD,
you're both members of the association,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're going that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are you exactly, and what do you
think is at play?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think from two sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'm really proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really proud about, like, everyone
who's in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we have seen this in three,
four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no red, it's not so mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, like, the authorities are
working against us.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, currently, I feel they are
working with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we came quite away.
[SPEAKER_00]: With excellent products on the market,
against everyone who's selling CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: products, there's customers who come to
their offices and say, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can improve my life, or my dog,
or a hospital, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all against what we see or do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we improve?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm from the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my product is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other side, I also want the
authorities to look at all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: products that I don't know, that they are
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And one was, okay, let's upload the COAs
or the state sheets, and let's get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little closer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also asked us to do some more
studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, IA, IA has a fantastic program now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, they're doing a toxicological study
on THC, which is necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join IA, like, the members there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pay contributions, it's all the money you
have to pay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Berlin, like, it's a fantastic place to
really, like, settle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Berlin is extremely
supportive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we got a grant for research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like, for tech, also for product
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also, like, a Berlin cluster
where they really support all the
[SPEAKER_00]: companies who are in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to co-civilization,
like, two associations, also some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: companies which are co-civilized,
I'm less a politician, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I run a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's on my field.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, what I would say, I'm
transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, show the blind people, they really
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Politicians are very open on this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, well, every party, every party on
this panel was at our location just to
[SPEAKER_00]: speak, just to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they say Brazil is far away,
what can we do here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go back to Jan, what you said at
the beginning, tolerate us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works in some states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works in some TVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us show that we do good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us show you that our productions are
like IFS or BFC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those extremely high standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these standards on the market,
until or on the food application,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are edited, are approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: UK is an example which we would like to
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Netherlands, where it's only tolerated,
is a good example which we can follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, the Americans, the Canadians,
are collecting data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you cannot do the same,
then in three or four years, then the
[SPEAKER_00]: market's open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will not be European companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to raise another whole issue,
just one very important one, because I
[SPEAKER_03]: think, if you're in the CBD business,
what you're looking at is, could we,
[SPEAKER_03]: as long as we don't have to know the food,
other which people can do it, can do it on
[SPEAKER_03]: extra wages or supplements or different
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think a much more interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is going to come up now that
we have an company bringing out CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the European markets, as a medication,
is where is the border between a CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer product, a well being product,
a health product, and medication to treat
[SPEAKER_03]: a disease, which obviously has very strict
regulation, and therefore is opening up
[SPEAKER_03]: whole different sector for marketing,
for, also for pharmaceutical regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I see is, as my point as a
physician, is, let's go back to the very
[SPEAKER_03]: important thing, let's look at consumer's
health, and to protect consumer's health,
[SPEAKER_03]: we should look at how dangerous is the
substance we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about CBD, and there is
data, there's plenty of data on safety,
[SPEAKER_03]: meaning we have a huge spectrum of
between, on one hand, let's say 400
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams, 800 milligrams in medical
context, and what I consider safe,
[SPEAKER_03]: about 70 milligrams as a consumer product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, looking at the consumer
again, is also looking at the change,
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is why CBD came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: People take it on one end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are taking CBD because it makes
them feel better.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the very fine, there's this clear
medical treatment, seizures in children,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's very clear, and there's a huge field
in between that I think should be limited
by how safe the product is, and give this
feel free for consumer's choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, if I take CBD to sleep
barrier, does it not necessarily mean I
[SPEAKER_03]: have a disease?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like insomnia, it just, you know,
it helps me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there should be some new way for
consumers to decide.
That's the main driver for the existence
of CBD.
People just sleep at it, and they know,
if I take it, something improves.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the question is, for a company,
when I bring it out, is, do I have to fear
[SPEAKER_03]: that a medical company one day will say,
okay, your product with 70 milligrams,
[SPEAKER_03]: 200 milligrams, whatever, the threshold is
going to be like, I say, this is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be, that's medication, and that's another
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have all different legal methods
to fight for, and this is an uncertainty
[SPEAKER_03]: where I think we should have a clear
regulation as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying, up to this amount,
for me, this could be quite high,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's not a dangerous substance,
from the point of view of a physician.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that we need to clear as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, that's a good panning word.
[SPEAKER_01]: And great timing, because the lab man
seems to show we've got 10 minutes left
[SPEAKER_01]: for questions, so I'd really like to give
it up to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would guess so, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No questions at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've learned everything today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, when's lunch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so, then I would like to come to one
last, a bit more business topic,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, you know, it's been pretty big,
and seriously, you can just, today,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want the prospect of any grocery
store chain, and you will find,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, best offers on CBD products,
and that whole stuff is, this coin has a
[SPEAKER_01]: flip side, because, I mean, if you look at
media reports, for example, test reports,
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever, you know, there has been some
damage to CBD products in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least this is what I perceive,
in some certain groups of the people,
[SPEAKER_01]: to say it in the most general way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they're talking about,
like, those difference among, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, serious companies, like yours,
you know, like the direction they're
[SPEAKER_01]: heading for medical CBD products,
I mean, just serious, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like high quality CBD products,
how do you cope with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there, like, a certain strategy of,
like, yes, some kind of, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: market clearance that, like, very serious
high quality companies are able to seem
[SPEAKER_01]: with themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a certain strategy that you have
in communications, marketing, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: mention, like, the importance of
transparency?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your views on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's more branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that you can buy a coke, or you can
buy bread, or milk, you either buy it from
[SPEAKER_00]: a company you trust in, or not on your
fanatic experience, it means that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: the milk is small, but the milk itself,
like, is still a product which you like to
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me, I would like to... Yes,
but, like, coke is in the market for
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of years, you know, everybody
wants Coca-Cola, and can differ Coca-Cola
[SPEAKER_01]: from cheap fake coke, or however you want
to call it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But CBD is still a pretty new market,
and do consumers really have that kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, experience or competence to differ
different brands in the CBD market?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they do, but you don't
buy, like, you don't go to a shop and you
[SPEAKER_00]: buy, like, today, like, a bread,
and some chewing gum, and so forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you relate a piece of the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you speak with people, or you listen,
or, like, you read them on the internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you see and read the stories that it
tells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a product that people buy at
first, and it doesn't help you,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was maybe the wrong product,
and you'll try again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not directly, but after six months,
it's still the same stories on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet, and you'll try again,
because they're success stories,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to be honest, like, you have different
inspection lists, you have different
[SPEAKER_00]: processes, companies who are, like,
certified, less certified, they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you ship it as quality on every product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's up to your brand to choose for a
certain type of product, price it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I think the market will agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd say just, let's get certified
and follow the rules about that for the
[SPEAKER_02]: cosmetics and the food supplements,
even though if we're dealing with the
[SPEAKER_02]: mouthful for the moment, let's get
everything under the roof, and let's get
[SPEAKER_02]: everything analyzed and accredited in the
models.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what we can do at this moment,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe for the general market, let's
encourage the farmers to try to get
[SPEAKER_02]: certifications from sources that are not
on the list at the moment, to make the
[SPEAKER_02]: business better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just sum it up with, number one,
be transparent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, don't underestimate the
customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're living in a different time of
exchange, the knowledge among customers
[SPEAKER_03]: has been way ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: And number three is really go for the
highest quality you can produce,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think this is the way to success.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually have a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, take your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, thanks a lot for helping us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of educated on the market today.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name's Phil Whitney.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an economics firm based out of
Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We look at the cannabis and high-risk HC
and market.
Our projections in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: market for the end of 2020 was that there
were 201 million pounds of excess biomass
[SPEAKER_04]: in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So would you recommend converting that
into some form of isolate, CDI split,
[SPEAKER_04]: and shipping it into the European Union?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or would you recommend flooding the
market, lowering the prices?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or would you recommend keeping that in
biomass and trying to end the market that
[SPEAKER_04]: way?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a question based on technology,
so rather.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I know, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: is already doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biomass with 10 plus percent of CBD is
probably something above the numbers that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: This can be, with everything, the high
conversion efficiency converted to the
[SPEAKER_02]: pure product, which one of the readiness
is the pure product is cheaper than not so
[SPEAKER_02]: pure product, because it crystallizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, in the U.S., with the hemp
that you have at your disposal,
[SPEAKER_02]: you manage to produce isolate very
cheaply.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that the cheap isolate that is
in Europe is by far not made from the
[SPEAKER_02]: European source.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we're actually asking, we really
should keep the hemp on flood markets,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it covers the European source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different product, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, who do you charge?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you come back to know the food,
which should be the first product that
[SPEAKER_00]: should pass in our food application.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for you, I would say it's an isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from then on, you can already confirm
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe two or three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long can you stop it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a different product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see here, consumers,
at least in Germany, they are really
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for the work-interaction
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as isolate, it's just something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just see what you all want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, there's this region outside of
Berlin, Brandenburg, which is actually
[SPEAKER_03]: helping farmers to cross the hemp as a new
business model.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that, because it's very close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would love to have this production
in Germany, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's international market.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we do not adapt to that, then that's
going to be the way it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is something that we have
to talk with politicians over and over and
[SPEAKER_03]: over again, especially post pandemic.
It's where you want to create jobs.
You make it so difficult for the industry,
which is growing, no matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to create jobs here or in the
US or anywhere else?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is always the question that you
should look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we have to discuss with the
politicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Germany wants to be in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, by your words, we are in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll thank them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's not much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
I'm still hungry.
I can already see that.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
