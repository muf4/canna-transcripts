[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's great to see Alex and our friends
at ICBC.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're big fans of this conference.
[SPEAKER_08]: They really bring people together around
the world in, I think, almost a unique
[SPEAKER_08]: way.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here with some friends, some old
friends from Europe.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a great panel here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Tom Zuber.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the managing partner of Zuber Lawler.
[SPEAKER_08]: As mentioned, we've been in cannabis a
long, long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're quite focused on the
increasingly global conversation relating
[SPEAKER_08]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Zuber Lawler represents a disproportionate
percentage of the biggest brands in US and
[SPEAKER_08]: increasingly global cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also founded Global Go, which is one of
the premier cannabis consultancies around
[SPEAKER_08]: the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got brand affiliates in 10 different
countries and the magazine Global Cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: Times.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm delighted to introduce this
outstanding panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think of three of the top attorneys in
Europe, and I've known each of them for a
[SPEAKER_08]: period of years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it really is an honor to be here
moderating this panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: First is Daniel Heyman, a dear friend of
mine, going back quite some time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Daniel, I think, was the first attorney in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_08]: So come on up, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's with MLL Legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to invite everybody up to
the stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then everybody, Daniel and everybody
else, will introduce themselves,
[SPEAKER_08]: say a little bit about themselves and
their organizations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kai Fried-McNearman, also one of the,
I think, the earliest attorneys in Germany
[SPEAKER_08]: by far and a friend of mine going back
several years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kai, it's great to see you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Peter Holmberg
[SPEAKER_08]: with Denton's.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we could just maybe say a few
words, I don't know however brief you want
[SPEAKER_08]: to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, we'll start with you at the end
there about your own practice.
[SPEAKER_08]: At Denton's.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: These chairs are much too comfortable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feeling home, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Peter Holmberg, I'm a partner with
Denton's.
[SPEAKER_05]: Denton's is by far the largest law firm
worldwide with over 20,000 lawyers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have active cannabis practices where we
are advising cannabis companies all over
[SPEAKER_05]: the world, in particular in Canada,
in the US, and in Europe, but also in
[SPEAKER_05]: Asia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now for 30 years in business, and 20 years
I'm, as you can see in the color of my
[SPEAKER_05]: hair, and I'm advising companies in the
life sciences field for over 20 years
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kai?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm Kai Fried-McNearman.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a lawyer since 2003.
[SPEAKER_03]: Started to work in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Started working in the cannabis industry
in 2017 as Germany legalized medical
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: By that time, the first CBD products came
up and no one knew how to regulate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it took a deep dive into these
legal landscapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a commodities trader before I turned
lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in business for about 12 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2019 we decided to establish the first
dedicated cannabis desk at the large law
[SPEAKER_00]: firm in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We represent a big part of the big players
in Swiss industry, along the value chain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and basically that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three kids, always tired.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Kai, why don't we start with you as an
update.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell us about, from a regulatory
standpoint, the status of things relating
[SPEAKER_08]: to hemp and CBD as well as medical
cannabis, and also maybe give us a glimpse
[SPEAKER_08]: as to recreational reform here,
what that's going to look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, how much time do I have?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where shall we start?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, okay, let's talk about
legalization, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the German government decided last year
in November to legalize cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they set up a coalition agreement
stating just one sentence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will allow the distribution of
cannabis for adults in licensed shops,
[SPEAKER_03]: just one sentence, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So and now we are in the middle of the
debate how to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are talking about maximum numbers of
licensed stores, of cabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an actual debate of THC content in
the flower to reduce or to limit the THC
[SPEAKER_03]: content in the dried flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are also talking about if we shall
allow finished products like grapes and
[SPEAKER_03]: edibles and beverages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's still in a flux.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are expecting the first draft in
October, November.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's presented by the Ministry of Health
because we think, or the policy thinks
[SPEAKER_03]: this is a health issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really have to understand that it's
all about health.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to do business here,
you have to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the debates are around this health
issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have really bad stuff in the
illicit market right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got worse and worse over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the need for reform is very,
very strong here in Germany right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we have the drug addiction
societies, for example, they're making a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of pressure on the Ministry of Health.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want these reduced opening hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to reduce THC content.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want no advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: No advertisement.
[SPEAKER_03]: No logo.
[SPEAKER_03]: No brands on the finished products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we as the industry are just fighting
all these points right now to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: liberal market model so that the industry
is incentivized to invest and to establish
[SPEAKER_03]: a business and to take the fight against
the illicit market right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's for the beginning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very helpful.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Daniel, we hear that the medical
campus market in Switzerland is opening
[SPEAKER_08]: up.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are some of the specific changes we
can expect and what challenges still
[SPEAKER_08]: remain?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big subject, a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have in Switzerland, we've had a
medical system where you're required a
[SPEAKER_00]: special permit from the Federal Office of
Public Health to be able to get access to
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has made life for a lot of
patients difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around 100,000 patients in Switzerland
today are known or estimated by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal Office of Public Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: To consume cannabis for medical purposes
out of maybe four or five hundred,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a dark number obviously of
cannabis consumers in total.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tragedy was that out of these
100,000 patients only three, four thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: actually had access to legal medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 96, 97,000 patients actually had to
resort to the illicit market and procure
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis from sources they knew or didn't
know and as we know and as my colleague
[SPEAKER_00]: Kai here mentioned, the quality is not
controlled in the illicit market and we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a big issue with cannabis that's
spiced up with all kinds of some synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: materials that nobody knows exactly what
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's quite a tragedy for the patients
associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what happened is that this special
nature of the permit became to some extent
[SPEAKER_00]: mute because such an overwhelming demand
emerged in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened now is that the
government realized it and now after many
[SPEAKER_00]: years the change is going to be enacted in
the beginning of on the 1st of August in
[SPEAKER_00]: fact where two things are essentially
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is moving from the schedule of
prohibited narcotics into narcotics that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used for medical purposes without
this special permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every doctor in Switzerland will
essentially be able to prescribe medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis which is a very big opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second thing that's going to
happen is that the export market is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to open up and that's interesting for
investors to realize because Swiss
[SPEAKER_00]: producers, a lot of whom have been very
active in the CBD market in the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: years, they're going to have a possibility
now to legally export medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: all forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the two main changes that are
going to happen specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've asked me as well about the
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenges are many.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say one of the main challenge
starts with education because most doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really understand cannabis or didn't
have the experience to prescribe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of whom have not heard about the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know which cannabinoids and
which mixes of cannabinoids prescriptions
[SPEAKER_00]: match which indication and for which
indications you can prescribe medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge field that's opening up
and for investors I would keep my eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: very open on opportunities in education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one field that's very
challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other field I would say is of
administrative nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a problem with filling in
magisterial preparations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is only one way to prescribe medical
cannabis in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to Germany I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have finished products,
fully licensed drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The path to go there is very wide except
for maybe Sativex and Epidiolex which are
[SPEAKER_00]: a very narrow band of indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you can have off-label
prescription but in general it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: through magisterial extemporaneous
preparations and it's not easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe based on extemporaneous
preparations because you have to grow with
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient which is also one of the
beauties in these products that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: really try it's trial and error but a lot
of doctors will be very reluctant to just
[SPEAKER_00]: go for trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the Swiss Society of Cannabis
and Medicine and other organizations that
[SPEAKER_00]: are working very hard to establish some
standards with which you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: start to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say the third challenge is
that there is no reimbursement from the
[SPEAKER_00]: health insurance and I think that's one of
the main issues that we have is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy is very difficult to prove and as
long as we don't have reimbursement the
[SPEAKER_00]: question remains whether this market is
really going to open up for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: patients who will be struggling to finance
the high costs of cannabis medication.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very helpful Daniel, thank you and a great
overview.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, what regulatory challenges do you
see with planned recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: legalization in Germany which has all of
us in America very excited?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, indeed a very, very interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take a top-down view at first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany as well as another over 180
countries are member of the UN Convention
[SPEAKER_05]: 1961 and two other conventions regarding
the transit, the transfer of drugs and
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis is still considered one of those
drugs which fall under the respective
[SPEAKER_05]: convention.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, Germany is also a EU member
state and has signed off on the Schengen
[SPEAKER_05]: agreement which also refers to the
respective UN conventions which means that
[SPEAKER_05]: the export of cannabis, let's say flowers
or other products for recreational
[SPEAKER_05]: purposes from one country to the other
country is strictly prohibited by these
[SPEAKER_05]: conventions in the Schengen agreement.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when the coalition actually wrote this
one wonderful sentence into the coalition
[SPEAKER_05]: agreement they did not think about,
that's in my personal opinion,
[SPEAKER_05]: where cannabis is sourced, the cannabis is
for the recreational, for the adult use
[SPEAKER_05]: market in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the first issue which we have
to solve.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is now being discussed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there solutions to it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there are solutions to it to a
certain extent at least as we have seen in
[SPEAKER_05]: Uruguay, Canada and the Netherlands where
recreational use is of course happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: So domestic cultivation for example or
homegrown for example are solutions to
[SPEAKER_05]: that and I may address that at a later
stage a little bit more in detail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the next step is we have to create a
respective legal environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need a law, we need a control body with
regards to the distribution of the
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will it be through pharmacies?
[SPEAKER_05]: Will it be through licensed shops as it is
mentioned in the agreement?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or how do we do that infrastructure?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the legal basis for it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who controls it?
[SPEAKER_05]: So lots of other challenges are of course
coming from the quality and we heard about
[SPEAKER_05]: that the current illicit market has
cannabis products on or sold which have
[SPEAKER_05]: additions, which have supplements which
are definitely unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the illicit market is using drugs which
do not of course have the same quality as
[SPEAKER_05]: we would like to have it on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the quality control of a recreational
cannabis product which is then sold under
[SPEAKER_05]: the government control that needs the
legal basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a number of challenges which
have to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you Peter.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's very helpful overview.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kai, let's take it back to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are some of the distribution rules
for medical cannabis and what is the
[SPEAKER_08]: process when trading these products?
[SPEAKER_03]: Medical cannabis is only traded via the
pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first step for you as a patient is
you go to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: The doctor has to be convinced that this
condition is suitable for cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: prescription and the decision of the
prescription is in the sole discretion of
[SPEAKER_03]: the physician.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not limited like in Portugal where
you have seven applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: With this prescription you go to the
pharmacy and get your medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what was as we started in 2017 the
price per gram medical cannabis was 22-23
[SPEAKER_03]: euros per gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we saw now the last two years a
couple of pharmacies really invested in
[SPEAKER_03]: logistics, got really really big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes employing more than 100
pharmacists and the prices dropped to 9,
[SPEAKER_03]: 10, 11 euros per gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: So almost comparable to the illicit
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the other hand we saw business
models like telemedicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you go to the physician and they have
sort of clinics all over the place,
[SPEAKER_03]: all over Germany and you have to show up
the first time in person and get your
[SPEAKER_03]: prescription and then you following
prescription you can obtain via online,
[SPEAKER_03]: via internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we see a huge number of patients,
of private patients, of self-paying
[SPEAKER_03]: patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not applying for reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just take it, okay it's like 10,
11 euros would pay that in the illicit
[SPEAKER_03]: market but now I'm a patient and I have
control over the quality, I have control
[SPEAKER_03]: over the product and I don't take the
hassle with my public or private health
[SPEAKER_03]: insurer to get reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the latest development we saw in
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big question will be will all these
people who are now in the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: market will they withdraw and switch to
the legal market or does the medical
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis market even increases further?
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good, thank you Kai.
[SPEAKER_08]: Daniel, what's the status of CBD products
in Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they marketed as tobacco substitutes,
fragrant oils, cosmetics, novel foods,
[SPEAKER_08]: therapeutic products meaning drugs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna try to keep this one a bit
shorter than the last answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those products, in fact tobacco
substitutes I would say accounts for one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the biggest markets in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is just dried flour, perfectly legal
to be sold as long as the THC content is
[SPEAKER_00]: below 1% which is a bit of an exception in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Czech Republic just introduced a
1% THC limit as well by the beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have cannabis oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a big issue about cannabis oils
that have been marketed to some extent as
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal office of public health
realized that these oils that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: sold as scented oils could be abused for
other purposes and came to the conclusion
[SPEAKER_00]: and issued an ordinance that basically
said that you have to denaturalize these
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you basically can't consume these
products without the extremely bitter
[SPEAKER_00]: taste so that market's not really existing
or it's at least expected to be
[SPEAKER_00]: disappearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's cosmetic products which are a
perfectly legitimate way to bring CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: products to market today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's one of the only ways that in
the non-medical use field you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: apply these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cosmetics is an absolutely valid way to
bring cannabis oils and other products to
[SPEAKER_00]: market for topical and even use in like
mouth sprays and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also something that's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the medical applications
which obviously have to run through a
[SPEAKER_00]: different kind of route but that's
absolutely also a legitimate way to market
[SPEAKER_00]: and already we see CBD oils and tinctures
that are prescribed for medical purposes
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, let's talk about the illegal
market.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you assess the impact of
recreational cannabis legalization on the
[SPEAKER_08]: illegal market in Germany and if you care
to throughout other parts of Europe?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah well that is one of those crystal
ball questions and I try to read my
[SPEAKER_05]: crystal ball right now because we don't
know how the market will develop and when
[SPEAKER_05]: we have recreational cannabis on the
market here in Germany from my point of
[SPEAKER_05]: view definitely not before 2024.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you look into the developments for
example in Canada how the impact was on
[SPEAKER_05]: the black market I think we have three
factors which are extremely important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one price, number two
accessibility, availability of the product
[SPEAKER_05]: and number three its quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the three major factors who have
an impact on the respective legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: market for adult use.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have the right price, if we have
the right availability and if you have the
[SPEAKER_05]: right quality I'm sure that we definitely
could cut the black market by half.
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's talk about how big is the black
market actually in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are talking about a medicinal cannabis
market around now between 18 to 20 metric
[SPEAKER_05]: tons per year with an increasing quantity.
[SPEAKER_05]: The black market is judged at
approximately 700 metric tons in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a significant market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the current calculations even for a
how do we tax cannabis for the
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational market is cutting it by
estimating 400 metric tons which is around
[SPEAKER_05]: half of the black market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So very very important as I said price,
accessibility, availability and quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that is competing with the illicit
market we definitely are in a position to
[SPEAKER_05]: cut it short by 50% or even more very much
depending on how this will be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: The current discussion about implementing
a certain cap on the THC level is
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely from my point of view helpful
for this discussion because it's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: divide the illicit market and the legal
market by the factor of whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: percentage it may be, maybe 15,
16, 18%.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that currently the medical market
demand for cannabis products with high THC
[SPEAKER_05]: content around 20% and above is definitely
the market at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may change, it may change to extracts
but that's what we have now in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the majority is a flower market with
high content THC flowers with constant
[SPEAKER_05]: quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can transfer that to the legal
market as well but I don't think that a
[SPEAKER_05]: limit of whatever the limit may be would
be helpful for the legal adult US market.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good and Peter or Kai I have a follow
up question relating to taxes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the United States particularly when
we went from medical markets to
[SPEAKER_08]: recreational markets we couldn't resist
the temptation to tax very heavily just
[SPEAKER_08]: saying wow here's an opportunity to bring
in some extra money to the government and
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a notion that this tax money will
go to educate folks on the dangers of
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_08]: That never really works out and the end
result on the illegal market conversation
[SPEAKER_08]: is that the illegal market thrives because
the pricing of legal product goes through
[SPEAKER_08]: the roof and so in the United States we
obviously have been further along in terms
[SPEAKER_08]: of years but there is a great big mess
because the illegal market continues to
[SPEAKER_08]: govern over half of the revenues of the
market just in California which is a very
[SPEAKER_08]: advanced market.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my question to you is do you have any
notion as to how Germany is going to
[SPEAKER_08]: approve approach taxation of the
recreational cannabis market?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah sure so the government is aware of
that problem of that tax and price
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one draft on the table by the
Green Party the Cannabis Control Act that
[SPEAKER_03]: drafted this law already back in 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in Bundestag in 2017 rejected of
course.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in Bundestag in 2021 rejected of
course by the last grant coalition and
[SPEAKER_03]: they propose four euros per gram of dried
flower and six euros per other products
[SPEAKER_03]: for extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's too much so then you will end up at
12 to 14 euros per gram but there was an
[SPEAKER_03]: economist very famous economist for
regulated markets here in Germany
[SPEAKER_03]: Professor Haukab and he did a study and he
suggests 2.6 euro per gram so that you end
[SPEAKER_03]: up with 10 euros including VAT of 19% and
that's a price which can compete on the
[SPEAKER_03]: with the illicit market and some consumers
of course are prepared to pay a little
[SPEAKER_03]: more because you have a controlled quality
and probably of course there will be room
[SPEAKER_03]: for even higher prices for craft cannabis
or something not the 50 euro per gram I
[SPEAKER_03]: saw in Barcelona I guess but for one gram
per one gram but the government the
[SPEAKER_03]: lawmakers are quite aware of that so I'm
pretty convinced I'm pretty sure that
[SPEAKER_03]: there will be a fair price at the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good that's wonderful to hear and I
hope you're correct Peter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah maybe some additions to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The point is of course who which
cultivator is in a position to provide
[SPEAKER_05]: this high quality cannabis at that point
at that price.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course you can have a relatively cheap
price for specific cannabis not but not if
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a GMP controlled if it's good
manufacturing practice following which is
[SPEAKER_05]: from my point of view the minimum quality
which we which we have to look at and I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't think the government is going to
change that we have to find cultivators
[SPEAKER_05]: who are in a position to do that probably
not in Canada probably not in Colombia
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe yes maybe Portugal yeah Malta for
example we can talk about that Macedonia
[SPEAKER_05]: North Macedonia for example Greece I have
cultivators coming up there as well as
[SPEAKER_05]: Denmark oops take into consideration the
current energy prices I have my doubts so
[SPEAKER_05]: that that's number one which we have to
look at who is in a position who which
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivators are in a position to provide
then the respective kind of it it would be
[SPEAKER_05]: exported anyway but I'm coming back to the
first problem which I mentioned is the
[SPEAKER_05]: 1960 one single convention which means how
can we import can we import at all any
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of cannabis for the recreational
market yes or no so we are maybe looking
[SPEAKER_05]: at domestic grow and how this is going to
be achieved is the next question we have
[SPEAKER_05]: three cultivators in Germany who are doing
relatively low quantities for the
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal market Afria, Aurora and Demekan
as we all know and they have put the first
[SPEAKER_05]: first cannabis cultivated in Germany on
the medicinal market so they would be in a
[SPEAKER_05]: position to increase as they have
announced already the production
[SPEAKER_05]: domestically but well others should
participate as well so do we have a tender
[SPEAKER_05]: process probably not do we have a
licensing process as we heard this morning
[SPEAKER_05]: probably yes so that is from my point of
view the way going forward and finding
[SPEAKER_05]: licensed producers in Germany as we have
it in Europe as we have it in the
[SPEAKER_05]: Netherlands they just tended by the way
out domestic cultivation for the
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational market in the Netherlands is
that the right way we will see that you
[SPEAKER_05]: probably hear that tomorrow at the ICPC
conference from Mr. Beanert what kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: ideas he may have on that and we'll see
the next issue we have of course a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: calculations on what is the the positive
impact of the recreational market and take
[SPEAKER_05]: into consideration that we really would
cover 400 metric tons the actual advantage
[SPEAKER_05]: take into consideration a tax on the
product like tobacco then of course the
[SPEAKER_05]: VAT and all the other taxes which are
surrounding the whole industry we are
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about an advantage of around four
billion euros per year for the for the for
[SPEAKER_05]: the government a rough calculation of
course not very founded because we don't
[SPEAKER_05]: know how it will work out but that's
that's a significant figure which is of
[SPEAKER_05]: course also driving that process here and
you know four billion income for the
[SPEAKER_05]: government is definitely something which
is worthwhile to consider and of course it
[SPEAKER_05]: is tempting always tempting as we have
seen that on the tobacco products and
[SPEAKER_05]: often on alcohol to just squeeze a little
bit more of the tax into from from the
[SPEAKER_05]: respective product just a little percent
here a little percent there and then of
[SPEAKER_05]: course we are exactly at the problem which
which Kai just mentioned we have a
[SPEAKER_05]: non-competitive product on the market for
the recreational use and that's something
[SPEAKER_03]: which we have to look at what is also
discussed is to have a mixed taxation
[SPEAKER_03]: model so to take more taxes on high THC
content products and low THC content
[SPEAKER_03]: products are taxed differently than this
is because again this is a health issue
[SPEAKER_03]: people think that high THC content is more
dangerous more to be controlled more to be
[SPEAKER_03]: there needs to be some prevention of using
high THC content products and they want to
[SPEAKER_03]: do that with taxation that's also a
proposition on the table but I think you
[SPEAKER_03]: can't handle that in the beginning so then
in the end it will come up that high THC
[SPEAKER_03]: products are too expensive and still
traded on the on the illicit market and we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want that we want a complete fight
against the illicit market and you really
[SPEAKER_03]: can't estimate the tax in the tax revenue
if you have if you split that up in THC
[SPEAKER_03]: content but we will see so it's on the
table it's discussed right now because of
[SPEAKER_03]: the high THC content the health issue
let's see very good thank you both
[SPEAKER_08]: gentlemen that was very helpful very
informative Daniel Germany's out a bit in
[SPEAKER_08]: front obviously respects Switzerland on
the recreational cannabis conversation
[SPEAKER_08]: what is the status of recreational
cannabis in Switzerland in Switzerland the
[SPEAKER_00]: both the National and the State Council
last year approved a change following a
[SPEAKER_00]: parliamentary initiative to regulate
cannabis and create a legal market so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're also moving right ahead it's just
taking a bit more time the Health
[SPEAKER_00]: Commission of the National Council is now
in a process of preparing draft
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation for the purpose of debate with
the Federal Council which is our executive
[SPEAKER_00]: power and so the conversation is ongoing
what's also happening in parallel is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the Federal Office of Public Health
there's been a change in the Narcotics Act
[SPEAKER_00]: that allows for pilot trials so as of
autumn this year the pilot trials will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually start to kick off it's all in the
context of purely scientific context as
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter mentioned the factors that will be
checked will be price availability and
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of course but also other
socioeconomic concepts the effect on the
[SPEAKER_00]: on the black market health will be
measured data will be collected and so on
[SPEAKER_00]: that will start I'm a bit skeptical about
the trials that they will be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce enough statistical relevant
statistical data before the legislation
[SPEAKER_00]: actually has to move on because I think
we're in we're in in a time where if
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany starts to legalize and has
legalized cannabis Switzerland will have
[SPEAKER_00]: to make a move much quicker so it's
actually good that our neighbor is now
[SPEAKER_00]: moving fully ahead and all the tough
subjects are being discussed and what I
[SPEAKER_00]: can imagine is that once there is a draft
legislation in Germany that the Swiss will
[SPEAKER_00]: simply more or less look at that and copy
paste and may give the Swiss spin to it
[SPEAKER_08]: and and move ahead a bit faster very
exciting well I'm hoping that that happens
[SPEAKER_08]: Kai let's come back to you what are the
administrative court of Cologne and the EU
[SPEAKER_08]: Commission on novel food applications
doing that can ultimately affect the CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: market in Europe as a whole oh yeah so
there was a ruling of the administrative
[SPEAKER_03]: court of Cologne in March this year saying
that CBD is in general a medicine and as a
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine you need an authorization by the
B farm like a regular medicine with the
[SPEAKER_03]: clinical studies phase one two three
double-blind placebo etc so this this
[SPEAKER_03]: process takes ten years cost you ten to
fifteen million euros at the best and the
[SPEAKER_03]: Cologne ruling said okay even if you
underdose it it was a product with the
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendation for 18 milligram of CBD
intake per day and even this underdosed
[SPEAKER_03]: dosage makes the or shall make the product
to a regular medicine and that was like oh
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone whoa what's going on here we are
applying for noble food authorization we
[SPEAKER_03]: the IHR is spending three to four million
for these noble food authorizations for
[SPEAKER_03]: toxicological studies with with rodents in
the first place and then human exposure in
[SPEAKER_03]: in the end and we expecting that the first
results are coming in the at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: next year so that you can market CBD as
food again as a supplement again that's
[SPEAKER_03]: not possible right now but if this Cologne
ruling would be right Germany would opt
[SPEAKER_03]: out of of the complete CBD marked in
Europe so so we took a deep analysis of
[SPEAKER_03]: this of this ruling and the administrative
court of Cologne has a special role in in
[SPEAKER_03]: its history they are the last fighters for
finished medicines so to say and but this
[SPEAKER_03]: ruling is against the the ECG rulings
which have been issued the last 20 years
[SPEAKER_03]: so in my opinion it's it's it's wrong it's
wrong ruling and it's only in the first
[SPEAKER_03]: instance so I can't imagine that this will
be that this will survive the next
[SPEAKER_03]: instances and at in the end at least the
European law will step in the free
[SPEAKER_03]: movement of goods principle will also
apply for these products in Germany so you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to handle it you have to look at it
and have to be very careful especially
[SPEAKER_03]: when you make health claims or any other
claims to your CBD product you should be
[SPEAKER_03]: very very reluctant and don't do that and
don't alarm the regulator because they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't like that if you if you promise too
much for these CBD products which everyone
[SPEAKER_03]: in the CB in the CB in the CBD business
did you know cures cancer it's good for
[SPEAKER_03]: anxiety for sleep disorders etc and you
can prove it okay so just don't do it and
[SPEAKER_03]: then we won't have rulings like the one in
Cologne Peter how do you how soon do you
[SPEAKER_08]: think when do you think recreational
cannabis will be legalized in Germany and
[SPEAKER_08]: in in other European countries and on what
factors does that depend yeah very good
[SPEAKER_05]: question Tom as the law as the
legalization of medicinal cannabis in
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany wasn't really a masterpiece now
they want to do it right why wasn't it a
[SPEAKER_05]: masterpiece too many gray areas too many
issues have not been regulated and came
[SPEAKER_05]: into practice and even still discussed for
example with regard to the import of
[SPEAKER_05]: flowers which are just GACP processed and
then GMP processed here in Germany is that
[SPEAKER_05]: a possibility yes or no so lots of issues
haven't been addressed at that point in
[SPEAKER_05]: time when liberalization in 2017 in March
2017 took place now they want to do it
[SPEAKER_05]: better which is which is a good idea we
had five or six now five hearings during
[SPEAKER_05]: the March of June I saw it during the
month of June with respect to various
[SPEAKER_05]: issues expert hearings regarding various
issues for the legalization of adult use
[SPEAKER_05]: we will probably hear a bit more about
that because only the last one was public
[SPEAKER_05]: by tomorrow what the outcome will be and
how it looks like the current plan of the
[SPEAKER_05]: government is that to have the first draft
of a law let's say let's call it cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: law because it has more facets let's call
it cannabis law will be on the table by
[SPEAKER_05]: October November I won't I believe it we
won't see it before December this year
[SPEAKER_05]: then of course it has to be accepted by
the Parliament we have to have one reading
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe a second reading in the Bundesrat
which is on a second chamber which
[SPEAKER_05]: currently doesn't have a majority of the
government so we would see how the
[SPEAKER_05]: reaction will be whether the Bundesrat the
second chamber is going to approve that
[SPEAKER_05]: law and when that will be the case so I
probably foresee in Germany the respective
[SPEAKER_05]: law to liberalize adult use in Germany not
before the end of first probably in the
[SPEAKER_05]: second quarter of 2024 maybe even later
2023 maybe even later and then the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: process started with regard to where do we
get the cannabis actually from are the
[SPEAKER_05]: current cultivators in Germany on the move
already can they increase the capacity for
[SPEAKER_05]: the first demand of the recreational use
which is one of the solutions which may be
[SPEAKER_05]: taken into consideration and I probably
foresee not before mid of 2024 the first
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational cannabis on the market well
of course it's a look into a glass crystal
[SPEAKER_05]: ball but take into consideration how long
it usually takes to have not only the laws
[SPEAKER_05]: in place but also then the respective
infrastructure in place with regard to
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation and distribution and
accessibility availability of the product
[SPEAKER_05]: is a major issue I think the timeline is
probably right okay yeah so that's
[SPEAKER_03]: perfectly right so if the draft comes up
in in Bundestag the first time which may
[SPEAKER_03]: be November December then usually four to
six months later the Parliament will agree
[SPEAKER_03]: on that and Peter is completely right but
I think there are solutions either to the
[SPEAKER_03]: UN the single convention problem and as
well as to the EU level we learned the
[SPEAKER_03]: last couple of days that the German
government started negotiations started
[SPEAKER_03]: talking to the European neighbors to Malta
to Luxembourg to Portugal they are meeting
[SPEAKER_03]: already trying to set up a new framework a
new legal landscape for cannabis in Europe
[SPEAKER_03]: which is necessary there are lots of
diplomacy diplomatic efforts are necessary
[SPEAKER_03]: now to establish new trade relations to
demand to alter all these international
[SPEAKER_03]: obligations Germany has and they started
this process so I'm confident that there
[SPEAKER_03]: will be a solution in the end what
probably will happen first is that
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis social clubs so homegrown and
corporate homegrown will be allowed as the
[SPEAKER_03]: first measure so if the law is agreed on
in March next year probably from that day
[SPEAKER_03]: on cannabis will be decriminalized and you
have the right for homegrown and to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: together in a cannabis social club and
this will be probably a long longer time
[SPEAKER_03]: so 10-12 months still the legal commercial
sales maybe really can start and in this
[SPEAKER_03]: meantime which is good because then the
pressure of the supply for the German
[SPEAKER_03]: population is eased but probably we will
see then maybe cannabis social clubs with
[SPEAKER_03]: thousand members or three thousand members
in Berlin and of course then you delegate
[SPEAKER_03]: the right for planting the table the
proposition on the table is three growing
[SPEAKER_03]: plants for every person so you can
delegate your right to grow three plants
[SPEAKER_03]: to a community and then you have huge
growth if you have thousand members so we
[SPEAKER_03]: have three thousand plants and you need a
facility you need the all the the
[SPEAKER_03]: equipment and you need to corporate
structure and the government or the the
[SPEAKER_03]: the regulators have to control it have to
check it regularly so let's see what
[SPEAKER_08]: happened I have one follow-up question
here and then I do want to leave time for
[SPEAKER_08]: one or two questions from the audience and
I have many more questions I'd like to ask
[SPEAKER_08]: but why don't we direct this to Daniel in
the first instance and then open it up to
[SPEAKER_08]: the panel I'd like to hear from everybody
quick answers though please so we can
[SPEAKER_08]: leave questions for the audience what
place or places do you see providing
[SPEAKER_08]: product for Germany and Switzerland
assuming that Peters implication that not
[SPEAKER_08]: all the product perhaps will come
internally from these countries but
[SPEAKER_08]: actually will be imported so in the United
States of course in each state
[SPEAKER_08]: particularly in regards to THC there is no
transporting THC across state borders it's
[SPEAKER_08]: it's perfectly illegal there and so that
doesn't happen at all whenever you start a
[SPEAKER_08]: new whenever a new state in the United
States emerges becomes legalized for
[SPEAKER_08]: recreational cannabis purposes operations
start a novel meaning you have to build
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis businesses from scratch in that
state in order to provide cannabis to that
[SPEAKER_08]: state that's not going to be quite the
same in Europe I'm curious as an American
[SPEAKER_08]: just understand and I think just as a as
an international business person I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: curious to know how that international
conference gonna work so quickly aside
[SPEAKER_08]: from Germany's internal production in
Switzerland's internal production where do
[SPEAKER_08]: you see most of your cannabis coming from
both for the medical and recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: markets in terms of countries in Europe
okay I was a commodities trader so I very
[SPEAKER_00]: much believe in pricing as being the main
driver so when we're talking raw materials
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe South Africa will be a very
interesting place maybe Thailand it could
[SPEAKER_01]: be very interesting how about in the short
term in the in the very short time yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: like next few years all in Switzerland
everything from Switzerland everything
[SPEAKER_01]: from Switzerland yeah pretty much Canada
maybe Canada maybe yeah okay Kai or Peter
[SPEAKER_05]: any thoughts on that Peter go well thank
you for the for the medical market we have
[SPEAKER_05]: new cultivators coming up in other
European countries we have Malta Portugal
[SPEAKER_05]: not to forget yes Spain maybe we have to
see how the legalization legalization will
[SPEAKER_05]: work there we have Greece not to forget we
have northern Macedonia Denmark already so
[SPEAKER_05]: they are our competitors to the current
large exporters like Canada and the
[SPEAKER_05]: Netherlands into Germany coming up so for
the for the recreational market I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: see any kind of export happening of course
I agree with you Kaveri there should be a
[SPEAKER_05]: solution but on the other hand you know we
28 member state have to change the
[SPEAKER_05]: Schengen contract with regard to that
subject matter this will not go within a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of months this will take much more
time as far as I can see I don't think
[SPEAKER_03]: that the Schengen equity has to be changed
because you can have a different
[SPEAKER_03]: interpretation on it but of course you
have to talk to your European neighbors
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have to find a unanimous solution
you have to convince European neighbors
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah as Peter said exactly the year so in
the first years in 1718 only imports from
[SPEAKER_03]: the Netherlands and from Canada were
possible to Germany and then many many
[SPEAKER_03]: other countries came online like Jamaica
Australia Lesotho European countries etc
[SPEAKER_03]: and the decisive question is the carbon
footprint of cannabis I think so if you
[SPEAKER_03]: really have to import most of the stuff
from other countries the 400 tons another
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 tons for the tourists which are coming
then to Germany so I would prefer that the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is coming from a country with
ideal climate conditions so that the
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon footprint is as low as possible
because we have to think about that look
[SPEAKER_03]: look outside we have a gas crisis we have
a Ukraine war the next winter is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be hard Germany wouldn't be able to afford
400 tons cultivation domestic in Germany
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah so I see we're out of time here do I
can I take one question from the audience
[SPEAKER_07]: if you have a brief question you don't
need to tell a whole story oh there you go
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah thank you let's hear for the panel by
the way it makes some noise hi good
[SPEAKER_06]: afternoon good morning actually thank you
very much for the presentation I'd like to
[SPEAKER_06]: come back with you and of course to all of
you gentlemen and the question that you
[SPEAKER_06]: raised Peter which is quality you know
right you know how we're gonna search find
[SPEAKER_06]: is and now we're talking about some
possible countries and things which are
[SPEAKER_06]: already happening we have a company
Uruguay Uruguay exports a lot to
[SPEAKER_06]: Switzerland we have a company in Portugal
Portugal exports a lot so it's already
[SPEAKER_06]: happening it's not like you know we have
to think off so Portugal has become a
[SPEAKER_06]: major exporter and as we know you know
today the Gold Center's GMP Farmer you
[SPEAKER_06]: know gold manufacturing practice of the
pharmaceutical industries for those who
[SPEAKER_06]: are not allowed what's your bet gentlemen
what would be the minimal requirement for
[SPEAKER_06]: producing countries be either South Africa
as Daniel had mentioned as possible new
[SPEAKER_06]: entrants or you know existing players like
Uruguay and Portugal well I I'd certainly
[SPEAKER_08]: take a crack at that just from the
perspective of what we've seen happen in
[SPEAKER_08]: other areas of the world outside of Europe
it's going to come down to as I think Kai
[SPEAKER_08]: had mentioned certainly carpet for print
but I think also it's gonna come down to
[SPEAKER_08]: as Daniel mentioned cost right ultimately
the biomass is a commodity right but the
[SPEAKER_08]: brands that sit on top of the biomass
whether it's it's a vape brand it's an
[SPEAKER_08]: edible brand that's where the real IP and
I think you see the discrepancy in pricing
[SPEAKER_08]: occurring right so ultimately those
biomass that the commodity prices will
[SPEAKER_08]: iron out so what you're gonna see is that
the product will have to come from places
[SPEAKER_08]: in Europe where it's cheaper to produce it
under great conditions for growing
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis Portugal is a great example yeah
the short answer regarding quality is EU
[SPEAKER_05]: GMP I believe in EU GMP of course it is
necessary for the recent market and I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't see a different quality happening
for the recreational market oh sorry what
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm coming and this will be the last
question because we're starting to run out
[SPEAKER_07]: of time I'm sorry
[SPEAKER_02]: very quickly when you speak about EU GMP
is picking about only the final product
[SPEAKER_05]: also for the cultivation no of course the
whole process has to be EU GMP compliant
[SPEAKER_05]: currently for the medicine market and I
believe this is going to happen for the
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational market as well I don't
believe that the cultivators of salad at
[SPEAKER_05]: this point in time with some greenhouses
would qualify for the cultivation local
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivation of cannabis here in Germany
only indoors thank you very much thank you
[SPEAKER_08]: very much Daniel Kai Peter great to see
you gentlemen always one more time super
[SPEAKER_07]: Daniel Heyman Peter home very informative
you you you you
