[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Bruce Barcop, and I am a senior
editor at Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leafly is a company in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get up every morning, every day,
and take the bus, I take the ferry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I ride a bicycle into the office
at Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go there, I sit at my desk, I assign
articles, I edit articles, I talk with
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues, we make plans, we do all these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every two weeks, Leafly sends me a
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Leafly and I have is not a mutually
agreeable arrangement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is called employment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to Leafly because it is my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one job.
[SPEAKER_00]: My colleague David Downs back there,
he also goes to Leafly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He often gets there earlier than I do in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's two of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just heard from Alex, Rebecca,
Jared, Ruben, and Tara.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, too, are more or less in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're up to seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ngaia, I'm counting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could make it without the legal
cannabis industry, but we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: count you in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a rough count of the room here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got about 100 people, more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're probably all in the cannabis
industry, or want to be in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal government does not believe we
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't count our jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to tell you we do exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at Leafly, we make sure that those
jobs are counted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our annual cannabis jobs count,
we do this every year, and it started
[SPEAKER_00]: about four years ago when we asked a
freelance journalist, he had a great
[SPEAKER_00]: business background, to go out there and
nail down the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, look, there's a lot of talk about
how many jobs are supported by legal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are varying numbers, very vague
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out there and just bring us back the
number, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes out, does a lot of research,
talks to people, talks to labor
[SPEAKER_00]: economists, talks to the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, comes back after four weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: and says, there's no number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason nobody has a number,
we said, wait, wait, there's got to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no number because there's no
recognition by the federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, federal prohibition is in force
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most state economists take their cue
in terms of how they tally jobs from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Bureau of Labor Statistics won't
touch cannabis, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's something more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that marijuana jobs actually don't
exist in the classification system for
[SPEAKER_00]: tallying jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's something called the NAICS
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: North American Industry Classification
System.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every job has a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see here, if you type in marijuana
or cannabis in the last couple of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got no results, zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people complained about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the folks who keep track of the NAICS
said, okay, okay, we hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see you actually exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to add you to the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody thought, oh, okay,
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're finally there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finally in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a problem with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here is the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana retail is now lumped in with 27
other jobs, as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are, marijuana retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana stores, recreation,
professional, or retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in there with beer making supply
stores, binocular stores, calendar shops,
[SPEAKER_00]: candle shops, closet organizer stores,
and hot tub supply stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have the same number, us and
Aquaquip.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all in there together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter how many jobs we add,
there's no real way to tell that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding them or if the binocular stores are
adding them or if there's some new
[SPEAKER_00]: American renaissance in hot tubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers are in the same position.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is actually a farmer, a cannabis
grower number, but they're in there with
[SPEAKER_00]: mint farmers, with hop growers,
this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to take a look at the data
that existed because every state reports
[SPEAKER_00]: something on legal cannabis, whether it's
a patient count or its number of licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: retailers or maybe it's weekly sales,
monthly sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of Florida, actually reports
ounces of cannabis leaf sold per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't report retail sales,
they report ounces sold per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weird stuff is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of Arizona reports by,
I think, number of pounds sold per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's weird data out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we used a number of existing reports
and worked with some economists who worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis and labor data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came up kind of with a system that
allows us to take that existing data and
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it into estimates of full-time
equivalent jobs per state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do this every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run through December and January.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes about two months to put it all
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year's number is 243,700
full-time American jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nearly a quarter of a million
Americans whose jobs depend on legal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very politically powerful number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how those numbers have grown over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017, we counted 122,800 jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: 149 in 2018, 211,000 in 2019, and 243,700
in early 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you'll notice, we're basically
adding jobs at a 20,000 a year,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40,000 a year, 60,000 a year clip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really is, you've got to know
that this is unique in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: No other industry is doing this right now
like the cannabis industry is doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you click forward here?
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing it, you know, we've heard
this morning about the tough times in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's no secret, a lot of major
companies have undergone layoffs,
[SPEAKER_00]: including my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through the vapey lung crisis over
the last six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vape sales are down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going through a lot of turmoil right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that turmoil, and within,
you know, companies laying off hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: workers, we saw Aurora up in Canada just
laid off 500 workers this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within that environment, quietly,
the engine of cannabis is growing jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last year, growing jobs at a
33,000 jobs per year clip, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, a remarkable story for us to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how those jobs compare to other
jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to point out the top three jobs
there that I listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listed for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listed them because they are very
politically powerful, symbolic jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There may not be a more politically
powerful job in America than coal mining,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we saw in the last election.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coal miners, only 52,000 jobs rely on coal
mining in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, 52,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logging, the Pacific Northwest,
logging is a hugely politically important
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: 72,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Textile manufacturing, especially in the
American South, 73,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal cannabis, 243,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: 700 jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These jobs matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons we do this count,
again, is to spread the message,
[SPEAKER_00]: make these jobs politically powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our jobs are out there, and they're worth
defending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did that job growth come from in the
last year?
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw most of it in Massachusetts,
where their adult use legal market really
[SPEAKER_00]: hit its stride in the past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Added, we estimated, more than 10,000 jobs
in the past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody been to Oklahoma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma is going nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma now has more than 5% of the
population with a medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than 5% of Oklahoma residents now
have a med card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that results in more than 7,000 jobs
added in the past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its medical market grew to such an extent
that 6,000 jobs were added in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just saw it grow, open its adult use
market, $40 million in sales in just the
[SPEAKER_00]: first month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida, we saw about 93% year over year
growth in sales in that state,
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks especially to the first time
introduction of smokeable flour introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: in their dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what we see in terms of the top 10
employers around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: California obviously is still by far has
the most workers, but look at how close
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the 5,000 worker difference,
here's the thing, and David Downs may
[SPEAKER_00]: speak to this a little bit after me.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, because of the sun setting of
its collectives law in 2019, a lot of jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: that existed in the legal system space
went into the non-legal space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually had to ratchet back our
estimate for legal jobs in California by
[SPEAKER_00]: about 8,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to do something similar in Michigan
where new tight regulations came into a
[SPEAKER_00]: market that was completely unregulated
prior to that, and we ratcheted back by
[SPEAKER_00]: about probably 7,000 jobs in the state of
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we expect those jobs to eventually
come back as more stores are licensed,
[SPEAKER_00]: as more municipalities allow stores to
open in their region, but it's a really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if California and Michigan had not
lost those jobs, instead of a 15% gain in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019, we would have seen about a 23% gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those two states accounted for a lot of
lost jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another thing I wanna,
a couple states I wanna point out and draw
[SPEAKER_00]: some attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts, we saw more than 300%
growth over the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supporting now about 13,000 legal
jobs, but Massachusetts, like a handful of
[SPEAKER_00]: other states, there is still a massive
amount of opportunity in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts has, what, 13,000 legal
jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about seven million people in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are about seven million people in
the state of Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington now supports about 23,000 jobs,
or so, so we see Massachusetts in that
[SPEAKER_00]: market as being basically just maybe half
of what it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are, I would say there are a number
of open shops in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of as in the dozens, whereas in
Washington state, we have more than 300
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed and open shops, and so we expect
Massachusetts to keep on growing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next year or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma, again, just an absolutely
incredible boom, especially in a state
[SPEAKER_00]: that is so culturally and politically
conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of activists out there in
other states looking at Oklahoma and
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a lot of inspiration from what they
see there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are folks in, working in Idaho,
I know Radical Russ Belleville is out
[SPEAKER_00]: there trying to get a medical marijuana
bill on the ballot in Idaho, and folks in
[SPEAKER_00]: other more conservative states are looking
at Oklahoma and saying, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they can do it in Oklahoma,
we can do it in our state too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida, Florida has more than 300,000
registered medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw 93% growth over the past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they're selling, I think 19,000 was
the number about four weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're up to about 21,000,
22,000 ounces of smokable flour sold every
[SPEAKER_00]: week now in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado and Washington, this number
surprised us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we thought of Colorado and
Washington as very mature markets who
[SPEAKER_00]: would plateau after, what have they been
in business now, six full years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we saw 8% growth in each of those
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple things we thought were going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was that just simply the slow eventual
movement of people from the illicit market
[SPEAKER_00]: to the legal market is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also anecdotally, basically
because Leafley's in Washington state and
[SPEAKER_00]: we see this ourselves, what we're seeing
are a number of consumers who are outside
[SPEAKER_00]: the classic marijuana consumer demographic
coming into the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming into legal stores for the
first time because those stores have been
[SPEAKER_00]: there for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their neighbors are shopping there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're feeling more comfortable about
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more than the stores, they're finding
products that suit their lifestyles and
[SPEAKER_00]: their health regimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a number of people who never,
well maybe not never, smoked marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But smoking was not a part of their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they've discovered a five
milligram mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they've discovered a 10 milligram
gummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does work for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does help them relax at the end of a
long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does help them, you know,
enjoy a movie on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they feel more in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can keep it in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in their backpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the evolution of cannabis
products has really helped to bring in a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of people into these mature
markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had just this past week, we put up an
article on Leafley called Cali Sober.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are people doing this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Cali Sober is essentially the idea
that you're essentially leaving alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're not leaving all substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're leaving alcohol, choosing not to
drink, but maybe you're mixing a little
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that article absolutely took off for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just saw click, click, click,
click, click, click, click, click,
[SPEAKER_00]: click.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's January, new year,
new you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I guess it's February now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But new year, new you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was sort of eye-opening for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like wow, there's a lot of people
interested in this concept of mixing in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in a way that is healthy and
suits them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe help them put down the drink or
the bottle a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's happened for me in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few states to watch that we're looking
at in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Great Lakes region.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these states are pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To us here on the West Coast, I think
maybe a little quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ohio, now we estimate, has about 4,200
jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saw 273% year-over-year sales growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 273% doesn't match the job growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of math involved here
because the year-over-year is capturing
[SPEAKER_00]: the sales actually in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the jobs number is based on where the
market is now in January 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, maybe they sold 10 million
in January of 2019 and 60 million in
[SPEAKER_00]: December of 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the market really is at that 60 million
a month figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois, again, a huge market already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of opportunity there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois is in a situation where they just
opened their adult use stores,
[SPEAKER_00]: selling $40 million a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that keeps on, we expect it to keep on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a $480 million a year market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois has a chance to sort of enjoy a
bit of the Colorado effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is Colorado,
when it opened in 2014, because of its
[SPEAKER_00]: central location, it drew people from
around the country who wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: experience a legal cannabis store for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw people driving up from Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw people coming in from all over the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were going to Colorado instead of
Washington because I live in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the state, but we're a little far
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a while to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois has a similarly central location.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's surrounded by five prohibition
states, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those stores on the Illinois border
are doing very, very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to continue to do well
as more visitors go up to Illinois to
[SPEAKER_00]: experience what we've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania, another kind of quiet state
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really boomed in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, they're continuing to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a medical system over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where I get up on my soapbox and
bring out a call to action and ask you to
[SPEAKER_00]: take this number, take your state's
number, and do something with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the coal mining industry,
hugely powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timber in the Northwest, hugely powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see us in the cannabis
industry come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as one of our panelists mentioned here
before, be proud of the fact that you work
[SPEAKER_00]: in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let people know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let people know there are others in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a congressional district that's
not in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's across the water in Kitsap County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my congressman is a gentleman named
Derek Kilmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Derek Kilmer represents my district,
which has Bremerton, which has a naval
[SPEAKER_00]: shipyard there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The naval shipyard jobs in Bremerton are
sacrosanct to that district.
[SPEAKER_00]: They symbolize employment and good jobs
for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when federal budgets come out and those
jobs are put at risk, Derek Kilmer steps
[SPEAKER_00]: up, he holds press conferences,
he leads protests, and he defends those
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs very publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what I like to do is I like to contact
Derek Kilmer or his staff every six months
[SPEAKER_00]: or so and just check in and say,
hey, I'm out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in the legal cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington State, we have about 23,000
other people in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are good jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are full-time jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hundreds of us are in your district.
[SPEAKER_00]: We vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a loudmouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell them about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk to them about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, I see you're not a
cosponsor of the Moore Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not even a cosponsor of the States
Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of quiet on the congressional
banking bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask you when you're going to step up
and co-sign one of these initiatives to
[SPEAKER_00]: defend my job?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the staff members will say,
oh, we're working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The congressman is very interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, it's a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please take this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spread it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that number out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can become a very, very politically
powerful number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll end by saying just simply,
we exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: We matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those who aren't counted don't count.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we do the jobs report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to see more about your
state, go to Leafley News.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the full report up there this
morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We posted it at 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a state by state appendix that
will tell you more about your individual
[SPEAKER_00]: state and what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to post an article by David
Downs on Mondays about specifically what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in California, why and where
those jobs were lost, and why we think
[SPEAKER_00]: they're coming back in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go out there and be proud of your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce Barka, one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Bruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome.
