[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to talk about work for a
company that's Bola, and we're probably
[SPEAKER_06]: the nichiest product on this entire show
floor, but we also offer some regulations,
[SPEAKER_06]: but what we do is very simple,
we only want to regulate the inside of
[SPEAKER_06]: those containers and the utilities,
and that's what we do, nothing else.
[SPEAKER_06]: So very, very, very, very niche-y,
and there's always one regulation in every
[SPEAKER_06]: market that hits us.
[SPEAKER_06]: For us, North America is cool,
Europe is tough, we have regulations that
[SPEAKER_06]: you can see in Europe, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, LJ, medicine, everything, but these
guys, they have a different perspective
[SPEAKER_06]: from a much larger view of the product out
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me introduce my two guests who will
be on the panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Luz Tchaikovsky, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Luz Tchaikovsky, yeah, from Metric,
and Ljuk Bichner,
[SPEAKER_06]: from Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you introduce yourself,
Ljuk Bichner.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Ljuk Bichner, and I'm an
assistant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I come from a supply chain manager in the
international trade background,
[SPEAKER_05]: and my company is Canada, and what we do
basically is we aspire to have different
[SPEAKER_05]: standards that are out there in the world,
what the U.S.
is doing, what Canada is doing,
how to merge that building with what
Europe is doing.
We have a huge U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: standard over here, and we're trying to be
safe from whatever else there is that need
[SPEAKER_05]: to be provided, and we kind of have to get
the Swiss thing, we took what everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: else is doing great, we're trying to mix
it up, and not really get better,
[SPEAKER_05]: but more is meant to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: See you later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Luke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Luz Tchaikovsky, a chief operating officer
for a company called Metric, and TRC,
[SPEAKER_04]: face to the eye on Metric.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been with the company for two and a
half years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came to the company by way of being a
government regulator, so I do love
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations, and I'm sure you all do.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to regulations and efficient
government, it's something we don't hear
[SPEAKER_04]: in the same sense, but we're going to talk
a little bit about that today,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll talk about some more things that
are happening in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Metric is a centralized database,
that the government uses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Licensees report into that system,
all of their inventories, how inventory is
[SPEAKER_04]: moving, test results, all the sales
information that goes into that,
[SPEAKER_04]: and governments can use that information
to help confirm compliance of licensed
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, open talk a little bit more,
if you all want to add anything to that,
[SPEAKER_04]: as we continue on the session.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's interesting, because the United
States is probably the most advanced,
[SPEAKER_06]: or let's say the oldest, professional
cannabis market that we have right now,
[SPEAKER_06]: in the professional cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if you just provide us with the
regulations that you guys have out there,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then we're going to talk a little bit
about Europe, and then we're going to mix
[SPEAKER_06]: it all together and see what comes out of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so just talking a little bit about
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: big picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our regulatory framework across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: is really kind of formulated from what the
government, at the federal level,
[SPEAKER_04]: hasn't done.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, way back when I first got into
cannabis policy back in 2010, the federal
[SPEAKER_04]: government basically said, we're going to
start enforcing less cannabis violations
[SPEAKER_04]: by people that are using it for medical
use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just by making that small comment publicly
about how they're going to take
[SPEAKER_04]: enforcement action, or not take
enforcement action, the entire industry in
[SPEAKER_04]: the United States started to formulate,
first with medical frameworks,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then later with the health use.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that was kind of the first thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second thing that the federal
government didn't do anything with is
[SPEAKER_04]: regulate.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't say on one hand, this is
completely illegal federally, we're not
[SPEAKER_04]: going to prioritize enforcement,
or certainly not going to regulate an
[SPEAKER_04]: illegal substance that's a food product or
agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they didn't do a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, a lot of regulations did formulate in
the U.S., formulated by a state by state
[SPEAKER_04]: basis, with each state interpreting what
they think the federal government would
[SPEAKER_04]: want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, as a result, we saw a lot of
different regulations based on whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: the enforcement priorities were for that
state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if they were more of a public health
focused state, the rules really had to be
[SPEAKER_04]: reflected in a public health focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was more of an enforcement or law
enforcement type of posture, the rules
tended to be a little bit more restricted
and reflect that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a more of an industry focused
type of environment, while the rules
[SPEAKER_04]: tended to be a little bit more permissive
and reflect that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, across the country, with 35 states
now, regulating cannabis in some way,
[SPEAKER_04]: shape, or form, it's a patchwork of
different approaches that have some
[SPEAKER_04]: similarities and some uniqueness to each
market, but also some similarities as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, every state is the cannabis industry
in itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, is there like an interstate market,
or is that entirely non-legal?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, there is an interstate market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very international, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's exclusive to the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we don't have to talk about
regulations there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all cash regulated.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, let's talk about Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, in Europe, I think we do have a
chance now to make it a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: different than the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I guess it is up to us to actually
learn from what's been happening over
[SPEAKER_05]: there, move closer together, and make sure
that we find the harmonized system that
[SPEAKER_05]: allows us to then actually build a
sustainable economy, sustainable industry
[SPEAKER_05]: based on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think what you guys have been doing
over there is absolutely great,
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely remarkable.
[SPEAKER_05]: For what we're doing, we use a great
inspiration from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use a great inspiration from Canada as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not even doing the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have the whole situation in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have all those different standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: And kind of, in the end of the day,
and that's the beauty of what you're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing, and I think what we're doing,
through TIC, we converge those gaps
[SPEAKER_05]: between different kinds of standards and
actually make something out of it that is
[SPEAKER_05]: workable for everybody out there,
and through that then kind of build the
[SPEAKER_05]: framework to allow for industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, let's stay here for a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what would you say are the most
important regulations that there are?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm a cannabis grower, but not from
the listed market.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make taxes on my income.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to pay all taxes out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to do it in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what are the top things that I have to
look at?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well,
[SPEAKER_05]: you get a medical license, you go through
the whole process, and that's basically
[SPEAKER_05]: the only chance you have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else is listed at the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, in the end of the day,
medical is the easiest, because it's the
one that's most defined.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the one where you have a clear
process and clear steps, and you follow
[SPEAKER_05]: those steps, and you actually have a
framework to put your business on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where in all the other markets,
if you work with CBD, it's a level two,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a level three, it's a level six,
it's a level one percent, it's a certain
amount to cover, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all that confusion is absolutely
unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does not help anybody when you get
through.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like one thing that takes over,
for everybody, it makes everything much
[SPEAKER_06]: easier to set out, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, this is, for now, since we're in an
interconnected world, we have access to
[SPEAKER_06]: data.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you two companies are based on
data.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what makes everything more
transparent and easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: From your perspective, how does data help
in bridging the business, or making the
[SPEAKER_06]: business more transparent, very
concretely?
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, when we talk about cross
markets, how can data help and achieve?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you appreciate that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think when you think about
regulatory frameworks and what makes them
[SPEAKER_04]: work really well, first and foremost,
you really have to have some cooperation
[SPEAKER_04]: from all of the different stakeholders
that are gonna be putting data into
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever systems are on the client.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I recall very vividly in the US,
we worked very closely, as a government
[SPEAKER_04]: official, we worked very closely with a
lot of stakeholders from law enforcement,
[SPEAKER_04]: from local government, state government,
federal government, as I mentioned
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier, was absent, even though we
invited them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also had many industry members.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, we were able to collaborate on
what the aggregate amount of regulations
[SPEAKER_04]: was going to look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there was a lot of input and a lot of
insight into those regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think most people felt like they
influenced some of the top people here
[SPEAKER_04]: that are in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: They verify that for you in some shape or
form.
[SPEAKER_04]: That said, you have to have the right
technological structure to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: collect the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what government chose to do in the
earlier years is to really carefully
[SPEAKER_04]: monitor all of the inventory that was
coming into the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, as plants were being, immature plants,
they started getting trapped, and all
[SPEAKER_04]: those inputs were collected along with
movement from one room to the next room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, subsequent to that, we harvested
and started moving these other products
[SPEAKER_04]: out to other places, premises,
and ultimately making them to the
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we originally did, as we were
concerned about inversion or diversion of
[SPEAKER_04]: a product out of the regulatory structure,
we started talking about, especially what
[SPEAKER_04]: we're seeing in Europe, which is likely to
be commerce between member states,
[SPEAKER_04]: the EU, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a lot of interest in
knowing what the confidence of that
[SPEAKER_04]: product is, so we know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think here in Europe, data to help be
able to determine whether or not that
[SPEAKER_04]: product is coming into a country is coming
from another authentic and well-regulated
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your take?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, data is one part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the end, our systems are built on
processes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I don't have to determine how
the more of those parts come together and
[SPEAKER_05]: actually discuss and put a certain
framework in, the more we do over here can
[SPEAKER_05]: actually create a framework that allows
for things that we do more efficiently and
[SPEAKER_05]: easier to store forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: A framework that combines only sounds as
such a daunting thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's an actual infrastructure
framework behind it, it can actually be
[SPEAKER_05]: made very straightforward in this way,
and very straightforward for all parts of
[SPEAKER_05]: the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think data is one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Data is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Data will help them from plugging a system
like this into a system like ours,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then allow for international trade.
[SPEAKER_05]: But all of that only can work if the whole
framework can be made.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way it has to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sooner than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing you said kind of struck me that
we're maybe thinking about another aspect
[SPEAKER_04]: that is worth mentioning, and that is that
if government can lead the way and help
develop the right data framework,
it gives birth to a lot of other commerce.
Just from my seat here, I can sit with
Luke, who is also a track and trace
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's more of a business to business.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see him as a competitor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also see the leader of a data company
and a compliance company.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of which use that data because it's
collected in a useful way.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a single source of truth that
everybody can access with invitation,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they can access it and be able to
utilize that to run other businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've seen point of sale companies,
resource planning companies, data
[SPEAKER_04]: companies, compliance companies,
all integrated in one of those data sets
[SPEAKER_04]: that government have led the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, if we had 500 different companies
that integrate into the system and use the
[SPEAKER_04]: government's data in some way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you personally have access to other
companies' data as well through your
[SPEAKER_06]: system?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: The data privacy laws are different in the
United States, obviously, than in Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, the system is very secure when
it comes to the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens, though, is take a point of
sale company, which is probably the
[SPEAKER_04]: easiest one to think about in terms of
third-party companies that integrate with
[SPEAKER_04]: our system.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they have a business relationship with
dispensary A, cultivation B, the
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturer C, they would be able to with
those companies' permission be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: exchange data from those systems so that
the canvas businesses do not have to put
[SPEAKER_04]: the data in twice and then make it more
available for the business systems that
[SPEAKER_04]: they use on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't be able to see any other data
from any other licensees unless you had
[SPEAKER_04]: that relationship.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really end-to-end integration
that's possible with the user system.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the great points about this
data, being able to share this data,
[SPEAKER_05]: is you already know is there a little bit
different in Germany, again, with the
[SPEAKER_05]: president, is if you own that data,
so you collect it and you can do something
[SPEAKER_05]: with it as a company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only as a software company,
but the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: company that are manufacturing this
computer.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do certain things in a certain
compliant way, you want to be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: share that either with your client,
be it a B2B client, or be it a C client,
[SPEAKER_05]: so that having the power to actually work
with that data is also a big tool,
[SPEAKER_05]: a big marketing tool in the last of the
transparency.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one example that I'd like to kind of
take is in the beginning, everybody was
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about virtual integration,
virtual integration, that the whole supply
[SPEAKER_05]: chain from A to Z.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we've seen in a couple of different
instances that that might have been
[SPEAKER_05]: probably the most successful business
model, and specialization in different
[SPEAKER_05]: parts of the supply chain basically become
a very daunting part.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think every time you have to completely
move all the tracking, tracing,
[SPEAKER_05]: everything that happened with your client
in a batch that was from company to
[SPEAKER_05]: company, and systems like this,
and systems like ours, allow companies
[SPEAKER_05]: that basically are not virtually
integrated, not in one company,
[SPEAKER_05]: but horizontally integrated, but that have
still complete flow of data in between,
[SPEAKER_05]: and therefore have complete traceability.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now, Canada has become a global
industry now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you face different state standards,
and different country standards now,
[SPEAKER_06]: and currently working, something that
might be the European, the medical side,
[SPEAKER_06]: that works out, that will help,
at least for the biggest of the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So from your perspective, and maybe also
from the side of customers, if you want to
[SPEAKER_06]: really become a globalized industry,
what are the next steps?
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you look into the future,
what needs to be done next in order to
[SPEAKER_06]: come from a regulatory body?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we all have to wait for governments
to put their heads together and do
[SPEAKER_06]: something about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, are they the best at doing that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they have to do it at some point,
but I feel like it's the industry's job to
[SPEAKER_06]: steer them in the right direction,
because we're the experts, so to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are the next few steps that have
to be taken by them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, again, it depends on the different
countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, from some sort of set that
we're doing, again, it depends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it medical?
[SPEAKER_05]: Medical, you can trade medical.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it like an industry?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a global industry, and the country
allows for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can move around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're now doing those recreational pilot
projects, which is, I think, a very
[SPEAKER_05]: exciting approach in how can industry be
formed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We basically just sort of, so the
government just opened up and said,
[SPEAKER_05]: look, propose us something.
Come up with an idea.
This is a study.
You can propose anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing that has to be Swiss or
any, which is a different story,
[SPEAKER_05]: but at the end of the day, it really
allows to study how can actually industry
[SPEAKER_05]: be formed.
[SPEAKER_05]: How can it be brought out of the black
market?
[SPEAKER_05]: How can there actually be tax collection,
as you mentioned before?
[SPEAKER_05]: How can different consumer protection
units and suicide status be supported?
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, how can we bring the people right
into the black market?
[SPEAKER_05]: How can we do that without just locking
them in?
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, I think the next step is how
to allow for countries or allow for the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry to create social studies or
studies within the different countries at
[SPEAKER_05]: first, and then hopefully, some of the
studies come to the same conclusion at
[SPEAKER_05]: some point, beginning to where systems
have been allowed for your country or your
[SPEAKER_05]: country and our country in that direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I support all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just thinking about the next steps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really feel strongly that industry
participants have a really significant
[SPEAKER_04]: role in working hard to establish a
credible, regulated framework,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm hearing that today from a lot of
the speakers on how important that is on a
[SPEAKER_04]: member state by member state basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's really encouraging to hear
that.
I think some of the more well-regulated
states in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: have really lent themselves to,
especially the government side,
[SPEAKER_04]: has given that space for industry to
innovate and move quicker without
[SPEAKER_04]: question, having been both in the
government sector and now in the private
[SPEAKER_04]: sector.
[SPEAKER_04]: The private sector is much more capable of
moving quickly, and they're much more
[SPEAKER_04]: capable of really setting the standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think to the extent that the
industry can really embrace a strong
[SPEAKER_04]: regulatory framework that allows for
competition, that allows for some
[SPEAKER_04]: comprehensive regulation with some
efficient governance, which I know,
[SPEAKER_04]: again, is not intuitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely counter-intuitive,
in fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to position the industry in such a way
where they can really help the government
[SPEAKER_04]: lead everyone to balanced public policy,
you can protect public health,
you can protect public safety,
while also allowing for a great many
[SPEAKER_04]: business interests to thrive within that
regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the industry itself, really has to
have a say in what public health and
[SPEAKER_04]: safety is, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And typically, historically, what we see
in regulation on many different regulatory
[SPEAKER_04]: frameworks, I studied this as part of my
doctoral studies, was trying to come up
[SPEAKER_04]: with ways for industry to help determine
what public health and safety is,
[SPEAKER_04]: rather than distrusting their private
interests to just make money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm hearing it today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of the panels where we were
talking about really focusing on patients,
[SPEAKER_04]: or really focusing on consumers,
rather than how everything was first
approved.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why I think what the ACM is doing
with committees, where they bring in
[SPEAKER_06]: experts from all fields in order to forge,
I mean, it's not a regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more like a standard, and it might be
a part of a law, because a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: lawmakers they refer to companies or
organizations such as ACM when it comes to
[SPEAKER_06]: creating regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that initiatives like ACM's
doing will really help to move this
[SPEAKER_06]: industry into a global future.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we have just a couple of
minutes left.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any questions, maybe,
that you guys have?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for sharing with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Yara DiCarsio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the founder and executive chair of the
Frontier Data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I've been following the work of
that measure has been doing for over a
[SPEAKER_01]: decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this question might be particularly
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see the greatest opportunity
and challenge for Europe when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: this idea of crafting this regulatory
infrastructure?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that it can lead to better information
sharing when we look at the US and the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities and challenges that we have
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was an easy one, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to refer to Luke, because he
knows the European market much better than
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just what I'm learning is I think one
of the biggest challenges is that member
[SPEAKER_04]: states within the European Union,
upstate Switzerland, and the UK,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're going to have their own public
health and safety priorities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also have their own priorities with
respect to the type of tax revenues that
[SPEAKER_04]: they want to bring in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So being able to find some common ground
between all of the member states is going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be a challenge when I start thinking
about how the different countries are
[SPEAKER_04]: approaching it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just assumed that I'm right about this,
but I think there are some countries that
[SPEAKER_04]: are more interested in exporting Canada's
outside their boundaries, whereas others
[SPEAKER_04]: are maybe more interested in a tourism
type of business, the customer type of
[SPEAKER_04]: relationship between licensees.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think trying to be able to harmonize
all of those and create systems that allow
[SPEAKER_04]: for uniqueness of public policy
priorities, but also allow all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: member states to be able to work together
more closely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think really well that
technology, data, and those types of
[SPEAKER_04]: companies really have the potential to
help bridge that gap.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in a lot of ways, I think government
has the right, could have the right ideas,
[SPEAKER_04]: but maybe not the ability to execute those
high level data and technology needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so companies like ours could certainly
help to bridge that gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think another big part is that systems
or standards are there.
Agriculture happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a trade happening all around the
world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Standardization has happened where it's
difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole bunch of other ones out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should stop to try to reinvent the
wheel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just choose one of them that is out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works for every agricultural good.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trading that all around the world
for food safety, health safety standards,
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer safety.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just basically choose one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all the same, more or less,
at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyways, then you have the GMP partners
just a little bit on top of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, having or
trying to reinvent the wheel all the time,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I think is the big issue of this
industry where everybody wants to try and
[SPEAKER_05]: reinvent the wheel, where at the end of
the day, a lot of it is there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So mix it together and create something
that works for all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think technology is a great stepping
stone to those different standards.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I would doubt that a regulatory body
would try to reinvent it, but usually it
[SPEAKER_06]: would work out the old way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: So any more questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, Louis, you mentioned it's
very helpful to have states that are
[SPEAKER_02]: already on board and stakeholders involved
in the process to implement data tracking.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do with the Oklahoma's world,
where resistance is going to equal
[SPEAKER_02]: persistence?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do you get those maybe traditional
American markets to get it and match up to
[SPEAKER_02]: the standards that are out there,
which I almost have this like,
[SPEAKER_02]: for your brains mentality sometimes to
wobble up less.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the question and good seeing
you too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mentioned earlier that there's some
uniqueness to all of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the states, the US states,
and how they've approached it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that I also feel strongly about
when it comes to differences is that there
[SPEAKER_04]: isn't just one way to approach this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's more about how good
government is at getting all the right
[SPEAKER_04]: stakeholders engaged.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think of states like Oklahoma,
they decided to take that approach where
[SPEAKER_04]: there's less barriers to increase.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have a large license debate,
so that will take some time.
[SPEAKER_04]: For it to evolve into a more mature
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have time for one more?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have time for one more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there one more?
[SPEAKER_06]: One more.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time is ticking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to the card.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Louis.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts about FDA
establishing grandfather products in the
[SPEAKER_03]: same way they did for Tobacco 2009,
when they said, well, deadline is 2007,
[SPEAKER_03]: and everything from that point on will
need a submission.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see that happening with them?
I would have to say probably not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably more because the variety of
product is so great, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, you have chocolates.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have other confections.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are not likely to just simply get a
pass because federal legalization comes
[SPEAKER_04]: around.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I think it's something that
everyone's really concerned about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of things to
consider when we talk about federal
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization, how great it is,
or how challenges it's actually going to
[SPEAKER_04]: present for an industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, we've built around the fact
that the federal government wasn't present
[SPEAKER_04]: for a lot of the decisions that were made.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think when you have products that are
much more analogous to tobacco,
[SPEAKER_04]: perhaps we start talking about others that
have various regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could essentially be giving cannabis
licensees or businesses a competitive
[SPEAKER_04]: advantage over other businesses that have
to live up to that regulation that they've
[SPEAKER_04]: been working with for years.
All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
