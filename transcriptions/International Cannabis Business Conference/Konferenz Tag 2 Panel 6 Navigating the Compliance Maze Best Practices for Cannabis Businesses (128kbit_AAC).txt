[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if this translates to the
European community, but welcome to the
[SPEAKER_06]: home stretch of ICBC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for being here, Brian Passman.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been an executive recruiter my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why am I qualified to be up here with
these folks?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done a lot of technical recruitment
in the life sciences industry and six
[SPEAKER_06]: years in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We specialize in senior leadership
placement.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of them are highly technical roles.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very impressive people who came over here
from North America, who have been building
[SPEAKER_06]: a very challenging niche in the legal
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this is going to be a fun
conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to let Jill introduce
herself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Jill Ellsworth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the founder and CEO of Willow
Industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I originally come from the food and
beverage industry in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also a registered dietitian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hold a master's in food science and
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at Willow, we developed a kill step
for cannabis utilizing ozone gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We operate currently in about 26 states in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and then also the Australian market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in addition to our technology,
we also have a consulting arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that consulting arm is filled with
microbiologists that go into cultivations
[SPEAKER_01]: to provide guidance, suggestions,
SOPs for mitigating microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination, and then implementing best
practices similar to GMP standards in the
[SPEAKER_01]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm George Terry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the executive vice president of
RADSource.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wardrobe today is compliments of Delta
Airlines when you trust them to move your
[SPEAKER_04]: baggage, which is my suit somewhere in
Sweden right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the only thing that the
general public in German stores had that
[SPEAKER_04]: fit.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I come from a medical background and a
telecom background.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came into RADSource about five years
ago, previously with pharma and before
[SPEAKER_04]: that with eight years of orthopedics with
striker orthopedics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So lots of background in the medical side.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're primarily a medical device company
where FDA cleared for blood.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got into cannabis about five years
ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys have seen me plenty of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got units throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm happy to be here again with our
friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Arthur de Cordova.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm co-founder and CEO of Zeal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zeal in German means target.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is what we do as a company.
[SPEAKER_05]: We target microbial pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our company's roots are in the food safety
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have installations throughout the
world in pasteurization and microbial
[SPEAKER_05]: remediation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Australia, Chile, Central America,
North America, and of course here in
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's talk about how you've grown your
respective businesses in this very rapidly
[SPEAKER_06]: evolving regulatory landscape in this very
dynamic industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: How have you grown your businesses
throughout all of that?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what opportunities excite you outside
of North America, beyond wherever you're
[SPEAKER_06]: targeting in the rest of the world?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's start with you, Jill.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started Willow in 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: So early days, United States Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're based out of Denver, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really the first moment that
the state started contemplating testing
[SPEAKER_01]: for total yeast and mold and other types
of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know Arthur and I can debate who came
to market first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we both kind of started in the
fall of 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what was interesting is that there was
no pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no groundwork for what a kill
step for what decontamination looked like
[SPEAKER_01]: at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been interesting to see the
evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back in 2015, I mean, I had to go to
the state of Colorado and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: listen, this is necessary for cultivators
to operate in a regulatory landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then also that we're protecting
consumer safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they hadn't even contemplated that
if a cultivator was presented with
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination based on the test results
they had required, there's no solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we really had to give them
suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to lay the groundwork for them and
let them know, here's what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's why you need to consider food
safety standards coming into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really helped the state of Colorado
understand what that looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also helped them move towards
coining this phrase decontamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: As other states started to legalize,
I mean, it's just been this kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: siloed mess of regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: No state has the same testing
requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've kind of had to rinse and repeat
the same process with all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: states, letting the regulators understand
that there needs to be a pathway towards
[SPEAKER_01]: treating product to ensuring that the
product does not have microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at the international market,
I mean, these standards are set.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I feel like it's a much better
pathway for cultivators to have best
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the US, it's been a huge challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, from my perspective, since we're a
global company as well, not only in blood,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we've even got a unit here in Berlin
that does the vaccine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're working on the vaccine for Ebola.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the regulations are different for
cannabis as it applies to your market in
[SPEAKER_04]: the European Union.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only do you have the federal European
regulations to deal with, but you also
[SPEAKER_04]: have regional ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even within Germany, you have 28
different regions, or I believe that some
[SPEAKER_04]: of them are broken down even further.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just understanding the regulations
within your region and partnering with the
[SPEAKER_04]: right people in order to make sure that
you're actually solving a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, you guys are out there,
you're thinking, oh, I want to make money,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But be in there to solve a problem,
because that's when the regulators are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to really work with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to be able to partner
with them better by solving a problem that
[SPEAKER_04]: they have, generally around public safety,
but also remember they're funded by the
[SPEAKER_04]: people as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to serve the people well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give a shout out to GMP.
[SPEAKER_05]: Incorporating GMP into a cannabis
regulatory framework leads to more
[SPEAKER_05]: predictable outcomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's generally a safer approach,
more predictable, repeatable results.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in a previous life, I was a country
manager for AstraZeneca.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you come from big farms,
that's where the karma GMP is ingrained
[SPEAKER_05]: into your DNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to Jill's point and George's point,
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: market has been chaotic, to put it short.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would not look to the United States
as your model for doing it here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: market can best be summed up with an
antidote from Winston Churchill,
[SPEAKER_05]: who famously said, I trust the Americans
to do the right thing after trying
[SPEAKER_05]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't look to the United States for
best practices.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got our scars on our back.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've made our mistakes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's well said, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's share some thoughts on how to
partner with regulatory bodies on moving
[SPEAKER_06]: the ball forward, as well as with
partners, growers, who might need some
[SPEAKER_06]: assistance in meeting some of their
regulatory objectives.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't we start with you, George?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Brian.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to say you're doing a lovely job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you're nice and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Twenty dollars in the mail.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So partnering with the right people is a
matter of, like I said, trying to solve a
[SPEAKER_04]: problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: So especially in this environment,
you got to understand your regulatory
[SPEAKER_04]: requirements in each country, plus EU
rules, plus, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: anything that's overwhelming within your
region.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you have to find the right
lawyers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to find the right consultants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to partner with the right people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even like I pointed out before,
you figure out what problems you're trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to solve.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are saying, OK, I've got a
product here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got, you know, shatter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got I've got a flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got this.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the problem that you're trying to
solve?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we want to make sure that we're
giving clean medical cannabis to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: GMP is a big part of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And GMP has got a lot of parts that,
you know, the IQ, IQ, and then they give
[SPEAKER_04]: the PQ.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the PQ requirements are very are
very stringent in some parts.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's got to be a part of your process
that you're solving a problem and that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're understanding what the local
regulations are with your partners.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to add to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll jump in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yesterday, many of the panelists up here,
I kept on hearing the word collaboration,
[SPEAKER_05]: collaboration with the regulators.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of maybe anger towards
the regulators.
[SPEAKER_05]: You think they're trying to make your life
difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're trying to figure it out,
too, just like we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're trying to do the best they
can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we found that, you know,
working with the regulators is
[SPEAKER_05]: collaboratively really yields great
results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tangling with your regulators is a recipe
for disaster.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like being a little warm and jumping
in the shark tank to cool off.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to turn out well for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would advocate, make them your
friends, work with them, and they'll serve
[SPEAKER_05]: you well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to Arthur's point, when I was in
one of the sessions yesterday,
[SPEAKER_01]: like he said, everyone kept saying,
become friends with your regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not be afraid of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, like, have a relationship with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't stress that more because we've
seen that happen, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in the states, and especially in the
states, I think a lot of cultivators are
[SPEAKER_01]: terrified of the regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know how to embrace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of bitterness about
the testing regulations that have come
[SPEAKER_01]: down, the requirements that they're
subjected to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they've really shunned the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But regulators are writing this playbook
as we, you know, move forward every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's been nothing done in this
regard before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always embraced the regulations
inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's helped our company,
but also really helped our partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, embrace that for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when usually when lawyers are brought
in the conversation, it gets scary.
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels like it's about to get
contentious.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to the point of playing nice with
regulators, because they're people,
[SPEAKER_06]: too, and they're trying to do the right
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, don't insult them and try to
steamroll them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what are your thoughts on retaining
legal counsel and if you've done that,
[SPEAKER_06]: do you have advice on doing so and
choosing counsel that can just counsel you
[SPEAKER_06]: to navigate and steer clear of being
steered to some choppy waters in any way?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, I think in litigation,
only the lawyers win.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you need some legal counsel to
navigate some of these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: George, that's on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've got an excellent lawyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can't read, you know,
400 pages in German of regulation for what
[SPEAKER_04]: the German pharmacopoeia, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got to have somebody who knows what
they're doing in the country that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to operate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even larger broadly across the EU.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, putting together the right
German team.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as the lawyers in the US,
and I agree with what Arthur said as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, don't challenge these people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sued a state in the US, and they came
after me with, like, we won, but they came
[SPEAKER_04]: after me, like, with a vengeance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, work with these people the
best you can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, you're solving a problem for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought in a government affairs team to
help us navigate the regulatory landscape,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also to, you know, get to understand,
like, what the regulators want,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do they need, you know, what are the
pathways they need to understand to help
[SPEAKER_01]: move this industry forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been, I mean, it's been
incredibly successful for us, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: that is certainly what we refer to our
partners as well, is bring in the
[SPEAKER_01]: government affairs, bring in lawyers to
help you, to help guide you in this,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, choppy waters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it doesn't get easier,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Arthur, you want to add?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: No comment?
[SPEAKER_06]: No comment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is being recorded, so that might be a
good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, years building this niche,
I mean, really, kudos, thanks for the hard
[SPEAKER_06]: work, all of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, jousting with legislators,
regulators, politicians, all the sorts.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you must have stories for days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any anecdotes you're willing to share here
publicly?
[SPEAKER_06]: Arthur, since you passed on the last?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll pass, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one story that comes to mind is in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: And go back to 2015, Colorado was the
first U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: state to go adult use.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had no regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_05]: They had no way to enforce it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the Marijuana Enforcement Department,
MED, tapped the Drug Enforcement Agency of
[SPEAKER_05]: the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said, we're going to bring you in to
regulate this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the DA officers raised their eyebrows
aghast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they said, no way.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been trying to put these people in
jail for decades, and now you want us to
[SPEAKER_05]: empower them to make them successful?
[SPEAKER_05]: Forget it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go find somebody else to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of that came, inadvertently,
the creation of the cannabis testing lab
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, which is a big, big dollar,
you know, industry right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when Nevada was looking to start their
adult rec market, they looked at best
[SPEAKER_05]: practices in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they copied them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Michigan copied Colorado and
Nevada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And 23 states later, all these states have
the same regulatory framework,
[SPEAKER_05]: really begun just by one DEA agent saying,
I'm not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was not very thought through.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's where we are today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone want to try to top that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, from my perspective and from my
company's perspective, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were in the cultivations all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the horrible things that you
think you've seen, you know, you kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: top that at the next cultivation you go
to, especially early days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, we see dogs running
around grows and they wonder why they're
[SPEAKER_01]: failing for microbials or, you know,
we saw a company trying to make bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: hash in a washer machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, just the like one customer we
had, they had chickens and ducks running
[SPEAKER_01]: around their farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, their flower was covered in E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and salmonella.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's like people do not understand
that this is a product that you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you see in the Frito-Lay facility,
you know, dogs running around and people
[SPEAKER_01]: not wearing PPE or wearing the gloves and
then eating a bag of Cheetos and then
[SPEAKER_01]: going back and like continuing to trim the
flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is an absurdity that we see
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really encouraging that I feel
like the European market has really
[SPEAKER_01]: avoided that because they put very strict
guidelines in place from the very
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'll be damned if I saw a
dog probably running around grow in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, the stories are endless,
but it's been encouraging to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: progression and that new cultivations
opening up really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about consumer safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: They care about quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I'm excited to see how
the industry keeps evolving.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got a little difference
perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, after years and years of doing
this, you go to people and you say,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, you know, we'd like to talk to you
about decontamination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We grow clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need any of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Three months later, hey, remember when you
were here?
[SPEAKER_04]: We think we need one of those units.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, out there, there's a false hope that
there's going to be clean grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to have clean cannabis,
you know, that's growing clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of products out there that
help that during the grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: But ultimately, you know, contaminants are
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're floating around this room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're going to need one of us in
order to make it safe for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not that you failed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a part of the way that the world
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's contaminants everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in the dogs that are running
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just, you know, when you're going
through a grow, you know, you want to make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure that it's all for public safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, whatever decontamination
method you choose, you know, don't think
[SPEAKER_04]: that you're going to be perfectly perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we pull stuff off the shelf all
the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do secret shopping ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And things that have cleared months ago,
they're not clear anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, always have a backup plan,
especially the investors, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that if I'm not going to get this flower
for a dollar, I'm going to get 20 cents on
[SPEAKER_04]: the dollar if I send it to Extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, have a plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to just add to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jill has really gotten out front and
changing the conversation in the United
[SPEAKER_05]: States.
[SPEAKER_05]: As George just referenced, there's been a
stigma that, and every cultivator thinks
[SPEAKER_05]: its plants are its own children.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, my children are perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're not perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: 20% plus minus are going to fail
microbial.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the conversation is shifting from I
don't have a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then the CFO comes in and says,
I'm no longer going to allow you to sell
[SPEAKER_05]: that to Extract at a deep discount.
[SPEAKER_05]: We then, you know, throw it over the wall.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they still don't want to do a kill
step up front.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jill really got out in front and
advocating this that, hey, we have to
[SPEAKER_05]: change the conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: A kill step is the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean that your product is bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the consumer's interests to do
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's also in the financial interests
of the company to create higher yield
[SPEAKER_05]: product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, as devil's advocate, I'm trying
because I'm sure you've heard this enough
[SPEAKER_06]: times to be prepared, is just you're
talking to someone who says, well,
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been consuming for years and decades.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've consumed all of these things you're
cleaning.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm alive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not just keep going that way?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's kick it off with, well,
do you have cancer?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you immunocompromised?
[SPEAKER_04]: These are medical patients as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just the recreational patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm pretty sure a lot of people have
deep ties to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can't have a medical patient that
gets something that's got aspergillus in
[SPEAKER_04]: it and expect that person to be well.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's documented cases all throughout,
especially the US, on people that get sick
[SPEAKER_04]: from contaminated cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jill?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, I was going to say the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're selling to a totally
different consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just you and your bros smoking
weed in the back of a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a mom that's trying cannabis for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's immunocompromised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or some medical patient that really needs
high quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is unacceptable if a cultivation
thinks that they don't need processes to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that this product is as clean and
high quality as it could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That conversation, I can't even with it
anymore when people say that to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh my god, I've been smoking
weed forever, and I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there could be indications that
you aren't fine, or you have stomach
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a whole suite of things that
could be happening if you're smoking or
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming contaminated cannabis that you
don't even put those two together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, we need to step up the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mostly I speak to the states,
not really the European market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So LinkedIn is very cannabis friendly,
thankfully.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe everyone here has seen it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I wonder how surprising it might be to
people here to hear that there are grows,
[SPEAKER_06]: there are legal grows, with animals
running around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still, that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're California sun grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just out in the open.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all natural.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dogs are our friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_06]: These are real things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have time for audience
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Rocky Petrullo.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a company in Columbia growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I got a question and a comment
for Jill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jill, you mentioned ozone and that you're
decontaminating the flower, correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you applied the ozone,
I was in the biohazardous industry for a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been a regulator for a decade.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was a stakeholder and built a
medical waste treatment plant for 10
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have both sides of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we used autoclaves to steam sterilize
biohazardous waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then it goes to the trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes to the landfill.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you ozone the flower, is it reusable
or is it destroyed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Post.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after we treat it with ozone,
can it go to the shelf as flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it go to the shelf as flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that is definitely the intention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are certain levels of
contamination that ozone does not get
[SPEAKER_01]: clean because ozone is a surface
decontamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our system is built around specific
treatment times in relation to ozone
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fully contained.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, the flower is fit for use.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a question regarding because you
were talking about a lot of regional,
[SPEAKER_00]: national, and even local different
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a pharmaceutical background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, there are a lot of efforts for
harmonization, even globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now when it comes to cannabis,
first thing we got now at the moment is
[SPEAKER_00]: the monograph in the European
Pharmacopeia, which is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced quite soon, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any more efforts or
developments into a more harmonized and
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally harmonized regulatory
landscape, even maybe a kind of ICH for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or will the ICH even take over cannabis,
or will it be as it is for long to come?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you've got a lot of time because I
think every, like Italy, Spain,
[SPEAKER_04]: Portugal, Germany, I think a lot of people
are probably looking to see what Germany
[SPEAKER_04]: is doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they might copy parts of that
across the Pharmacopeia and the AMRADV and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the requirements in Germany are pretty
stringent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember, these other countries are
going to look for what's best for the
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So they might take parts of what's good
for the consumer from Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the second part of that is then when
you get to the regional and the local,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's going to be tax money.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much are they going to make tax?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because believe it or not, the government
likes to make money off this as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So did that answer the question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about decontamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you comment about because some of the
countries, at least it's what I have
[SPEAKER_02]: heard, has some issues regarding
radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not a regular issue, it could be a
consumer issue or even customers that say
[SPEAKER_02]: they will not accept product that was
going to irradiation because if it's bad
[SPEAKER_02]: quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you comment a little bit on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about irradiation has
linked with not as good product?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the irradiation question, there's a
span all the way from RF up to gamma.
[SPEAKER_04]: So radiation is the lights that you're
seeing now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's UV.
[SPEAKER_04]: High-power gamma and E-beam are what
they're used regularly in the EU and also
[SPEAKER_04]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's studies that are out on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: They use it for medical devices.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was at Stryker, all the knee
implants, all the stints, everything gets
[SPEAKER_04]: irradiated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a trail of people out there
that think that radiation is bad,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's proven safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's generally regarded as safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: All prescription drugs in the US are
irradiated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't have to be labeled either
because they're generally regarded as
[SPEAKER_04]: safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: The government's done away with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just understand the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Understand the motivation of the people
that are saying stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's something that keeps the world
clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's different methods, ozone,
peroxide, RF.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's different methods of
decontamination across the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they wouldn't be out there if they
weren't safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's all the time we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it once again for this
wonderful panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
