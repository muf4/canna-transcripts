[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much, Ungayo.
[SPEAKER_12]: Appreciate the introduction, but as
anybody knows that works in politics,
[SPEAKER_12]: it takes so many people to change the law,
and as we are progressing state by state,
[SPEAKER_12]: now nation by nation, it takes a team of
people, it takes educating people,
[SPEAKER_12]: it takes bringing people who opposed us
into our side, you know, letting them see
[SPEAKER_12]: the light, whether it's because of
political reasons, financial reasons,
[SPEAKER_12]: moral reasons, and as people in California
have found, as we definitely know in
[SPEAKER_12]: Oregon, you can have a great law,
great program, produce great cannabis,
[SPEAKER_12]: but there are so many issues, taxes,
banking, exports potentially, that require
[SPEAKER_12]: federal action, and that's what this panel
is about, cannabis and the feds.
[SPEAKER_12]: We are really reaching a tipping point
where we can see bipartisan efforts to end
[SPEAKER_12]: prohibition at the federal level,
and these are folks here joining me on the
[SPEAKER_12]: stage that are helping make that happen.
[SPEAKER_12]: I will kick it off down the line for them
to introduce themselves, but first I do
[SPEAKER_12]: want to give a little introduction to Neil
Levine next to me with the Cannabis Trade
[SPEAKER_12]: Federation.
[SPEAKER_12]: Neil is a longtime activist bringing
activism in the industry together,
[SPEAKER_12]: he worked for the Marijuana Policy
Project, helping fund my first
[SPEAKER_12]: decriminalization effort I worked on in a
little college town called Columbia,
[SPEAKER_12]: Missouri, all the way back in 2003,
and so the man has been putting in the
[SPEAKER_12]: work to move us state by state and now at
the federal level, so Neil, tell us a
[SPEAKER_12]: little bit about yourself and kick it on
down the line to our esteemed panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Anthony.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody hear that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning, thanks for coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: As Anthony said, my name's Neil Levine,
I am the CEO of the Cannabis Trade
[SPEAKER_07]: Federation.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're kind of a startup, we've only been
around for about seven months,
[SPEAKER_07]: but we have some of the largest players
and a diversity of businesses,
[SPEAKER_07]: both through geographic location and by
business type throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're coming together to pull together an
aligned federation of organizations to
[SPEAKER_07]: really give us a representation that we
need in DC, and to end prohibition.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our number one focus in this Congress,
in the 116th Congress, is the States Act,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the States Act, basically what it says
is, if you're not in violation of state
[SPEAKER_07]: law, you're not in violation of federal
law.
[SPEAKER_07]: The real world impact of what the States
Act would do, it ends 280E, penalty
[SPEAKER_07]: taxation.
[SPEAKER_07]: The States Act would open up real
commercial banking services.
[SPEAKER_07]: The States Act would permanently end the
threat of the Department of Justice
[SPEAKER_07]: kicking in our doors for the crime of
running a state legal and compliant
[SPEAKER_07]: business.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think that we have a real opportunity
to pass that into law, this Congress.
[SPEAKER_07]: The President has said he would sign it if
it reaches his desk.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have bipartisan sponsors on both sides.
[SPEAKER_07]: Senator Cory Gardner is the lead sponsor
in the Senate with Elizabeth Warren.
[SPEAKER_07]: Earl Blumenauer is the lead sponsor in the
House with Representative David Joyce.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are building from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, very happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with that, I will kick it down to our
steam panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, as Anthony said, I've been doing this
for 16, 17 years now, and what's really,
[SPEAKER_07]: really exciting is, we've all been talking
about when is it gonna end?
[SPEAKER_07]: When is the federal state conflict going
to end?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here are some folks that are
actively working on it, and I believe that
[SPEAKER_07]: these are the folks that are actually
going to have it end this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, with that, Melissa.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Neil.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Melissa Kuypers-Blake.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a partner with Brownstein Hyatt and
Farber-Shrek.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been lobbying for 20-plus years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Started at the state level in Tallahassee
in Florida in 1996 and have grown that
[SPEAKER_11]: practice into state lobbying throughout
the country and federal lobbying in
[SPEAKER_11]: Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't be prouder to represent the
Cannabis Trade Federation and be working
[SPEAKER_11]: on this incredible legislation with Neil
and his team, and Neil's right.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a real opportunity in this
Congress between the bipartisan approach,
[SPEAKER_11]: the state's rights approach, how things
are gonna get addressed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we'll talk a little bit about
substance more here in a second,
[SPEAKER_11]: but with that, I'll turn it over to my
colleagues on the stage to introduce
[SPEAKER_11]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Melissa.
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Andrew Shor.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've spent about 15 years on Capitol Hill,
ending my career as the chief of staff at
[SPEAKER_10]: the House Republican Conference.
[SPEAKER_10]: Spent a lot of my time working on issues
that I frankly believe Republicans should
[SPEAKER_10]: embrace, such as cannabis and the free
market that you all have brought into this
[SPEAKER_10]: industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I run a boutique law lobbying firm,
and we are really, really excited to work
[SPEAKER_10]: with the Cannabis Trade Federation to pass
the States Act and help all of you run
[SPEAKER_10]: legal compliant businesses in the light of
day.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's exactly how it should work.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not a Republican principle,
not a Democrat principle, it's an American
[SPEAKER_10]: principle.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Nadim Elshami.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually been working on these issues
for quite a long time because for the past
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 and a half years, until I retired from
Congress, I was Nancy Pelosi's
[SPEAKER_00]: communications director and chief of
staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I left Congress about a year and a half
ago, and this is a very important issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel that there's an opportunity that
is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, this is the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a lot of education, but now we
feel that the chance is before us,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I look forward to discussing this some
more.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you guys could grab a couple of those
mics so we can just have one person
[SPEAKER_12]: without and share them around.
[SPEAKER_12]: Before we get into the hard question,
let's start with optimistic reasons.
[SPEAKER_12]: Neil, you can take this, or somebody else
can take it off if you want.
[SPEAKER_12]: What are the factors that you see both in
D.C.
[SPEAKER_12]: and across the country?
[SPEAKER_12]: Why do you feel like this could be the
year?
[SPEAKER_12]: Why are we at a tipping point at this time
at Congress?
[SPEAKER_07]: Prohibition is untenable.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have 33 states plus the District of
Columbia has opted out of prohibition in
[SPEAKER_07]: some form.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have 10 states plus the district that
have opted out entirely.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Canadian markets are up and roaring.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mexico is about to set up their own
markets.
[SPEAKER_07]: We see South America, European countries,
now Asia.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the Middle East, all starting to move
towards the end of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are seeding what should be an American
industry for no other reason except for
[SPEAKER_07]: bad policy that has no basis in science.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are an industry that has hundreds of
thousands of employees today working
[SPEAKER_07]: directly for the industry or supplying the
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are here fighting for hundreds of
thousands of people's mortgages,
[SPEAKER_07]: hundreds of thousands of families' health
insurance, and it is untenable.
[SPEAKER_07]: The idea that you could go to federal
prison for doing your job that you are
[SPEAKER_07]: legally allowed to do under state law is
one of the most un-American things that I
[SPEAKER_07]: could possibly think of.
[SPEAKER_07]: The states have spoken.
[SPEAKER_07]: The people have spoken.
[SPEAKER_07]: The polling is through the roof.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are now super majority for legalization
nationwide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then when you ask, regardless of how you
feel about cannabis, if a state passes a
[SPEAKER_07]: law, should the federal government come in
and interfere?
[SPEAKER_07]: 75% of Americans say no.
[SPEAKER_07]: The idea of having the federal government
step out and allowing the states to
[SPEAKER_07]: continue to do this pulls 10% higher than
ending prohibition, and ending prohibition
[SPEAKER_07]: pulls at a super majority.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has become completely untenable.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is time for this to end.
[SPEAKER_07]: The combination of the polling,
of the states moving, of outside pressure,
[SPEAKER_07]: is what has brought us to this place where
we have to do it, we have to do it now,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we've done a lot of work on the
states.
[SPEAKER_07]: The states are going to continue to open
up markets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congress must act.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is time for Congress to act.
[SPEAKER_12]: I imagine it has to do with a lot of the
factors that Neil mentioned, but as you
[SPEAKER_12]: speak to people in Washington,
D.C., are you hearing different things
[SPEAKER_12]: from them?
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have any stories?
[SPEAKER_12]: You may not be able to publicly provide
their name, but can you share some stories
[SPEAKER_12]: about how things are changing?
[SPEAKER_10]: To follow on what Neil's saying,
the reason that you're seeing a lot more
[SPEAKER_10]: Republicans get engaged in this issue is
because of the upward pressure from their
[SPEAKER_10]: state legislatures.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you've got states like Georgia,
Arkansas, Oklahoma, any right leaning,
[SPEAKER_10]: center right leaning states, and the
legislatures are calling those members who
[SPEAKER_10]: many of them served with, before they went
to Congress, they were in the state house
[SPEAKER_10]: or the state senate, and they say,
look, we've passed this bill, and it can
[SPEAKER_10]: be just CBD, it can be medical,
whatever, and they call their member of
[SPEAKER_10]: Congress, or they see them back in the
state capitol, and they say, look,
[SPEAKER_10]: we've done the work.
[SPEAKER_10]: You say you're for states' rights.
[SPEAKER_10]: You went to Washington, you said you would
support a states' rights agenda.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here is your chance to support a
states' rights agenda.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, embrace what we've done,
allow us to be the incubators of this
[SPEAKER_10]: industry that we said we were.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_10]: That message is getting through loud and
clear, and we're hearing that time and
[SPEAKER_10]: time again that members, you know,
they want to be consistent in their views,
[SPEAKER_10]: and the people have not just only spoken,
but they've acted.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and I'll add in here,
too.
[SPEAKER_11]: So my primary responsibility on behalf of
the states' act is the senate republican
[SPEAKER_11]: caucus, which you can imagine is an uphill
climb and a lot of conversations on this
[SPEAKER_11]: issue, and really we're kind of in
negotiation, and the real pressure is
[SPEAKER_11]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Andrew's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the first question is,
what has my state done, and what have my
[SPEAKER_11]: citizens decided?
[SPEAKER_11]: And the good news is, to Neil's point,
a lot of the answers on that are yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our legislatures either passed it,
our ballot measures are potentially going
[SPEAKER_11]: to be on the ballot, or in fact it has to
be passed.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had opportunities, for example,
to meet with brand-new members of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: Senate whose states just passed,
like Utah and Missouri.
[SPEAKER_11]: And those are really game-changing
conversations, because we go in with a
[SPEAKER_11]: little bit of an upper hand, and the
opportunity to say, look, not only did it
[SPEAKER_11]: pass, it passed by ten points,
or it passed by seven points, and that's a
[SPEAKER_11]: big deal.
[SPEAKER_11]: And these members, many of whom got
elected by a really narrow margin,
[SPEAKER_11]: want to really listen to what their state
wants.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's been a really interesting dynamic
to be able to talk to them about what's
[SPEAKER_11]: happening back home.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yes, those are really the things that
we use as our leverage points in these
[SPEAKER_11]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there's a lot of questions about
after states act, what's next,
[SPEAKER_11]: and our response is, look, states is the
first step.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got to get something done in federal
law in order to open up answers to all of
[SPEAKER_11]: these other questions about how the
industry would run in a long-term way.
[SPEAKER_11]: But really, that's the key, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: We want the industry to operate in a
long-term, sustainable, regulated fashion,
[SPEAKER_11]: and states act is the first step to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are any of you from what you would
consider a purple or red state?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anyone here from the Midwest?
[SPEAKER_10]: The best thing you can do when you go home
is to reach out both to your member of
[SPEAKER_10]: Congress, but also to your state
legislator.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you've done something in the state,
reinforce that idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go meet with them and say, hey,
will you call our congressmen?
[SPEAKER_10]: And they'll do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They will do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to jump in real quick to piggyback
on something Melissa said.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Chris.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're hearing from the left is very
different from what we're hearing from the
[SPEAKER_07]: right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're engaged in these conversations on
the right, and we have reframed this to
[SPEAKER_07]: talk in terms of federalism.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you're a true constitutionalist
and a federalist and a conservative,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's really hard to argue that we are not
the personification of federalism with 33
[SPEAKER_07]: states plus a district that have opted out
with different regulations and different
[SPEAKER_07]: laws and no product that can leave a state
boundary.
[SPEAKER_07]: That being said, what we're hearing from
the left is also incredibly encouraging.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we're hearing is that they want a
solution that includes restorative justice
[SPEAKER_07]: and social equity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that fact that we now have,
let's be honest with each other,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a nonpartisan.
[SPEAKER_07]: My first campaign that I ever did 20 years
ago was Jesse Ventura for governor.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was true.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm an honest nonpartisan,
registered nonpartisan.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Democrats haven't done anything
for us in large part, just like the
[SPEAKER_07]: Republicans haven't done anything for us
in large part.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing that the Congress has done
to date is pass an appropriations rider
[SPEAKER_07]: that puts a restriction on spending DEA
resources on going after medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_07]: licenses in the states.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been incredibly helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now that we have legal leadership in
one of the houses of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congress saying that prohibition needs to
end with full expungements and full
[SPEAKER_07]: legalization on the federal level,
how amazing is that?
[SPEAKER_07]: How amazing that we've gotten to this
place.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as Melissa was saying, I don't think
there's an appetite for, from the intel
[SPEAKER_07]: that we're hearing, we don't think there's
an appetite in the Senate and with the
[SPEAKER_07]: administration for full decrim on the
federal level yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is an appetite for deferring to
the states because while there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: disagreement of what comes next,
there's also growing amount of agreement
[SPEAKER_07]: that the conflict between federal and
state law needs to end.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the first law that I quarterback
personally passed into law was Vermont in
[SPEAKER_07]: 2004.
[SPEAKER_07]: Vermont in 2004 medical marijuana was
three plants, one mature, three qualifying
[SPEAKER_07]: conditions, no industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fast forward a little over a decade later,
Vermont becomes the first state
[SPEAKER_07]: legislature to end prohibition.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't always get the law that you want
the first time out.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we need to do is we need to pass the
fundamental game changing piece of
[SPEAKER_07]: legislation that permanently changes the
equation and the question on the federal
[SPEAKER_07]: level from should we do this to how should
we do this?
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we get into how should we do
this, CTF, we're going to be side by side.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where we think this ends is the end of
full prohibition and full expungements.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we think the states that can pass into
law and we're going to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's the key to this
Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me talk briefly about how Democrats
view this, especially in the House.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an issue they've been talking
about for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they're going to be holding
hearings, this Congress, on various pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: of legislation, whether it's the finance
issue, whether it's 280E, whether it's HR
[SPEAKER_00]: 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, what is the art of the possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we should view this with
the state's act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can the state's act pass the House?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but it's going to require some
support from the ground up, from you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also from members from the Republican
side and from members who are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, look, this is what we can do because
we know that this state's act could also
[SPEAKER_00]: pass the Senate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I view this in three parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: First part is educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you said, call your member of
Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see him if you can here in the district
or go see him in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second is you get a little tough,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want this to be done, this Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third is demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So educate, advocate, demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure all of you could do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heck, we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to require the voters to
really say this has to get done.
[SPEAKER_10]: The other linchpin of our strategy is
bipartisanship.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is critical that this industry launch
itself in Washington as bipartisan.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see time and time again that
industries that have thrown in with one
[SPEAKER_10]: party or the other, it's a very
short-sighted strategy, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Regardless of our personal views,
you create jobs, as Neil likes to say,
[SPEAKER_10]: millions of mortgages, health insurance,
jobs.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so maintaining that level of
bipartisanship as we move forward on the
[SPEAKER_10]: state's act will really set the stage for
you all for a long and prosperous future.
[SPEAKER_07]: Soon to be millions of mortgages.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very soon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and Nadine, with your experience
working with Speaker Pelosi, it seems to
[SPEAKER_12]: me, kind of alluding to what Neil said
about neither party has done enough for
[SPEAKER_12]: the cause, that the Democrats have talked
the better game.
[SPEAKER_12]: And talk about the appropriations bill,
they've had more voters vote for it,
[SPEAKER_12]: but they haven't been in the majority.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now they're in the House majority.
[SPEAKER_12]: And to me, for a lot of progressives,
I feel like it's put up or shut up time
[SPEAKER_12]: and that the Democrats will pay a price at
the ballot box if they don't pass good
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis legislation.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think, Speaker Pelosi, the
Democrats in charge kind of feel that?
[SPEAKER_12]: Or is it still onto the industry and the
cannabis community to make that known?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think that you've done enough,
you haven't done enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many of you here have actually
called your member of Congress?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's something you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Call your member of Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your member of Congress is supportive,
you call them up and say, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're behind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do your part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in terms of Democrats, yes,
Democrats want to get something done.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a hearing in the financial
services committee next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in one of the subcommittees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, heck, this is February.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've only been in power for two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a month long government shutdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the early hearings is on this
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel good about where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continue to push.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also focus on what is the art of the
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if we could get everything we
wanted, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a bipartisan effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a Democratic House and a
Republican Senate and a Republican
[SPEAKER_00]: president.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the magic?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at it as a triangle,
what is in the middle, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can everyone agree on?
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe it's the state's act,
but they need to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every, you know, the House and the
Senate and the president, they all need to
[SPEAKER_00]: get there together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may take a little longer, this
Congress, but we feel strongly with your
[SPEAKER_00]: help and what we're doing, we'll be able
to get there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Melissa, I'll kick this off to you.
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems you have really the most
important job with the Senate caucus.
[SPEAKER_12]: No pressure.
[SPEAKER_12]: It all depends on you.
[SPEAKER_12]: With Mitch McConnell, with his position,
is it really all about swaying Mitch
[SPEAKER_12]: McConnell or is it things that like Cory
Gardner, Republicans from other states
[SPEAKER_12]: that have gone legal, either, you know,
adult use or medical?
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it convincing them to put pressure on
Mitch McConnell?
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you give us a little peek behind the
curtain about how we go about,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, getting a bill introduced in the
Senate?
[SPEAKER_11]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the question right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So to Nadine's point, you know,
we expect the House to hold hearings on
[SPEAKER_11]: these issues, pass a lot of legislation,
whether it's on banking individually,
[SPEAKER_11]: some social justice reform, and then,
of course, the state's act, all of which
[SPEAKER_11]: will pass.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll see headlines.
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll go to the Senate, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it'll be crickets in the Senate.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not going to be an immediate
response from the Republican-led Senate
[SPEAKER_11]: about what to do on these bills,
but we do understand and believe very
[SPEAKER_11]: wholeheartedly that the only possible
vehicle is the state's act.
[SPEAKER_11]: So how do we get the state's act done?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, a couple things.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got the White House support.
[SPEAKER_11]: The president's team has already said,
if you get state's act on my desk,
[SPEAKER_11]: I will sign it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some leverage with Senate
Republicans who want to get elected in
[SPEAKER_11]: 2020, for example.
[SPEAKER_11]: Next analysis is, okay, where does the
bill get, you know, heard?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it in committee?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it on another bill?
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are things that we're still working
out about how the process would actually
[SPEAKER_11]: get done.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I can tell you that we are
aggressively pursuing Mitch McConnell and
[SPEAKER_11]: his team and making the case for why this
is the right solution.
[SPEAKER_11]: If Kentucky wants to pass medical or
recreational marijuana, they can,
[SPEAKER_11]: but the federal government isn't going to
tell them that they should.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is an argument that plays really well
in southern conservative states,
[SPEAKER_11]: for example.
[SPEAKER_11]: On the flip side, should Kentucky pass a
measure, it would go a long way to help in
[SPEAKER_11]: our conversations with Mitch McConnell.
[SPEAKER_11]: So just saying, if anybody wants to pass
something in Kentucky, that would be
[SPEAKER_11]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we are very much negotiating with that
leadership office.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mitch McConnell's actually started calling
me the marijuana preacher because we are
[SPEAKER_11]: in there so much pushing and trying to
find a way to get this done.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, like I said, you'll see a lot of bills
come out of the House.
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll see some dialogue about the Senate
and where those bills are going to end up.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if this becomes an issue for enough
Senate Republicans where they go to their
[SPEAKER_11]: leaders, McConnell and others,
and the leadership team and say,
[SPEAKER_11]: this is something that I need,
all of which is being led and orchestrated
[SPEAKER_11]: by Corey Gardner from Colorado,
then you'll see some movement.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's really our strategy.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're getting the meetings.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just did a Capitol Hill visits this
week.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had 31 meetings with the cannabis trade
federation board and our lobby team on
[SPEAKER_11]: Capitol Hill with members that truly
matter in this analysis, Senate
[SPEAKER_11]: Republicans that are what we consider to
be the most likely that we'll get,
[SPEAKER_11]: all of whom said, keep talking to me,
tell me what else you find out,
[SPEAKER_11]: and let's find a way to get this done.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're not quite there yet, but we're
getting there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can always tell the momentum in
politics, and we feel the momentum,
[SPEAKER_11]: and it's something we should all be really
excited about.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, yeah, I got a couple more
questions where we kick it off to the
[SPEAKER_12]: audience for their questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think wisely you folks are concentrating
on the States Act because that is what's
[SPEAKER_12]: possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: Neil, this may be best for you,
but say the States Act passes,
[SPEAKER_12]: and I think we've seen the Democratic
candidates all come around to
[SPEAKER_12]: legalization, either evolve from former
positions.
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see Joe Biden, who is an architect
of very bad criminal justice legislation,
[SPEAKER_12]: start to kind of give some talk about why
he was wrong doing that in case he jumps
[SPEAKER_12]: in the ring for president.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it seems to me Donald Trump,
he is a really, in the 90s he's quoted as
[SPEAKER_12]: saying he supported legalization of all
drugs.
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like he's very much a state's
rival.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a kind of liberal right, kind of
libertarian on the issue, really.
[SPEAKER_12]: So States Act passed, then what's next?
[SPEAKER_07]: States Act passed, what's next?
[SPEAKER_07]: First off, if 280E goes away at any point
in 2019, it doesn't apply for all of 2019.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's next is if you're prepaying your
taxes at a federal government,
[SPEAKER_07]: you're getting a check back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And folks know this, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: When your CPA fills out your tax return,
they have to sign an affidavit that says
[SPEAKER_07]: everything in here is true, therefore they
have to take 280E into account.
[SPEAKER_07]: States Act passes, we've taken the
illegality out of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to take 280E into account
in your tax return.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can sign that affidavit without
taking it into account.
[SPEAKER_07]: The IRS would have to catch you on audit,
and it wouldn't apply because any state
[SPEAKER_07]: licensed and legal business would be
removed from the CSA if you are licensed
[SPEAKER_07]: under, so that's the immediate impact.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna see credit unions and
community banks start offering FDIC
[SPEAKER_07]: insured bank accounts and real commercial
banking services.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't it be nice if you're running a
good business with a good bottom line and
[SPEAKER_07]: a healthy EBITDA that you can get a
business loan?
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are the immediate impacts,
and certainly don't have to worry,
[SPEAKER_07]: like I said, no one's gonna come from DOJ
and come kick in your doors and seize all
[SPEAKER_07]: your assets for the crime of running a
state legal business.
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the next Congress goes,
what we would like to see come next is
[SPEAKER_07]: full federal legalization with
expungements, and that's what we'll work
[SPEAKER_07]: towards.
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the whole suite of bills that
Representative Blumenauer has put out,
[SPEAKER_07]: we agree, outside of a 25% excise tax,
we probably agree with just about every
[SPEAKER_07]: one of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, as Nadeem said, States Act is the
art of the possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: Congress has never given us anything
outside of an appropriations rider.
[SPEAKER_07]: This would be seismic permanent monumental
change, and we're going for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've assembled a team to go for it,
where we need everyone's support that we
[SPEAKER_07]: can get.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what comes next is we engage in a
dialogue of, okay, now that we've done it,
[SPEAKER_07]: what does it look like?
[SPEAKER_07]: What does the end of prohibition look like
on the federal level?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of varying opinions on that,
and there's a lot of stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would convene those stakeholders,
and we'd have a real discussion about
[SPEAKER_07]: that, and again, but where we think this
needs to end is if you have a criminal
[SPEAKER_07]: conviction for something that's no longer
illegal, that should be expunged,
[SPEAKER_07]: and there should be full federal end of
prohibition as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: With the States Act, if it passes,
or let's go with when it passes,
[SPEAKER_12]: I think something that would entice
California cultivators, I know it
[SPEAKER_12]: definitely entice cultivators in Oregon,
what about exports?
[SPEAKER_12]: Would the States Act allow states to
interact, to agree to compacts?
[SPEAKER_12]: If Nevada or Arizona wants to import
California cannabis, would the States Act
[SPEAKER_12]: allow that, or would we need a new
legislation?
[SPEAKER_07]: States Act very simply says, if you're not
in violation of state law, you're not in
[SPEAKER_07]: violation of federal law, so state law
would reign.
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, every state law says a product
can't leave a state boundary, so it would
[SPEAKER_07]: defer to state law.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, then last question for me
before we kick it back to audiences,
[SPEAKER_12]: how do people support your work?
[SPEAKER_12]: What do they need to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: CannabisTradeFederation.com, you can
donate, you can sign up for our list,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can volunteer, you can call your
members of Congress.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Gaio, got a question from the audience
for us?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yes, indeed, let's hear it once again
for Anthony and all of our panelists.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll remind you, question and answer
period, please try to keep your questions
[SPEAKER_04]: brief, we don't need the whole history of
cannabis before you ask your question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know how some of you are when you've had
hash for breakfast.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike Gretzian from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate the efforts on legislative area
with the States Act.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the other side of the coin?
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of news do you have on just a
completely de-scheduling front?
[SPEAKER_07]: As we said, the House is probably going to
pass more than the Senate would be willing
[SPEAKER_07]: to take up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our intel is that there's absolutely no
appetite in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: Senate in this Congress to deal with full
decryption.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is with regards to lobbying,
particularly the Republicans, is John
[SPEAKER_02]: Boehner engaged in any lobbying efforts
with Mitch McConnell?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are they just drinking buddies?
[SPEAKER_07]: Boehner's not, Akeridge and Boehner's not
part of our coalition, so they are,
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know to what level he's,
we're engaged with Speaker McConnell,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we're in regular talks, and as Melissa
said, we're very optimistic that we're
[SPEAKER_07]: making some progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is, in states, because Utah
just recently passed a bill, they have
[SPEAKER_03]: passed a bill and they have since gone
through recently and are gutting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: With helps to certain outside
organizations, maybe churches involved
[SPEAKER_03]: there, so what is the best way to approach
situations like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know lobbying senators and all that kind
of stuff is probably our best bet,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the Church of Jesus Christ has a
really large poll in the state of Utah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, what happened there was
that the campaign team cut a deal before
[SPEAKER_07]: the election.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether the initiative passed or not,
they would go to the legislature together
[SPEAKER_07]: to pass a law that would be acceptable to
the governor and the establishment in
[SPEAKER_07]: Utah, so then it passed, but the campaign
had already cut that, obviously I wasn't
[SPEAKER_07]: part of that, but the campaign already cut
that deal, so they're adhering to the deal
[SPEAKER_07]: that they cut to bring medical marijuana
regardless of the result of the election,
[SPEAKER_07]: so that's what's happening there.
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there more questions?
[SPEAKER_12]: All the way over there.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to chime in on that one
because that is something that you notice
[SPEAKER_12]: really in every state that passes a law is
that it gets changed, or most states,
[SPEAKER_12]: it gets changed, and so I would encourage
folks to make the people that go against
[SPEAKER_12]: the will of voters make sure they pay a
political price and let them know that as
[SPEAKER_12]: people that supported it, as patients,
as an industry, that you want the will of
[SPEAKER_12]: the voters supported, and then really put
political pressure on maybe some key swing
[SPEAKER_12]: votes, and really in a place where you're
up against other interests, that can be
[SPEAKER_12]: tough to do, but really that's the only
thing you can do, or try to correct it
[SPEAKER_12]: with future legislation to get back to
what the will of the voters want.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We still need activists, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lobbyists are cool, too, but activists,
man, be in the halls, talk to your people,
[SPEAKER_04]: get everybody fired up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might be premature, but I was just
wondering if in your conversations with
[SPEAKER_01]: lawmakers, if imports have been addressed
on the federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I come from the long history of
flower growing in Southern California,
[SPEAKER_01]: and South America has crippled our
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now, outside of that,
there are importing some Canadian cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: for research, which is actually incredibly
annoying that they're not using American
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis for that research.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, we have better cannabis anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, but outside of that,
no imports, and again, the state's act
[SPEAKER_07]: simply defers the state law, so as far as
international borders and boundaries go,
[SPEAKER_07]: that would have to come in, we'd have to
address that next.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris Conrad here, thanks, great panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really hoping the feds do something
this year with you guys, but I'm just
[SPEAKER_08]: wondering, on the other side of the
equation, it seems to me like we've got
[SPEAKER_08]: the court system, and historically,
we've had a mixed bag.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, the OCBC, they said they
couldn't, that you don't have a necessity
[SPEAKER_08]: of defense for distribution of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we had race decisions saying that the
feds could raid you in your home for
[SPEAKER_08]: medical marijuana, even if you're a
state-licensed patient.
[SPEAKER_08]: But more recently, we've had things like
the San Diego decision that said that they
[SPEAKER_08]: couldn't use federal law to overturn
California's marijuana laws, and they also
[SPEAKER_08]: had the Oklahoma versus Colorado decision.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they said that they couldn't force
Colorado to recriminalize because of its
[SPEAKER_08]: effects on other states.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just wondering about what's going
on on the pike right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there some cases we should be
watching?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you see any kind of cases that might
be, people might be thinking of a filing
[SPEAKER_08]: in terms of if you wanted to try to use
the court system.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that was very effective for the gay
rights movement, but we haven't really had
[SPEAKER_08]: the same kind of relationship with the
courts as them, and thank you again.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is me again.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some questions for some of the
lobbyists, too, while they're here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the most concerning, Chris,
the most concerning recent cases are some
[SPEAKER_07]: of the tax cases that are all coming in
the government's favor for 280E.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Harborside case, I think, was very
concerning.
[SPEAKER_07]: They ruled.
[SPEAKER_07]: The tax years that they ruled on for that
case weren't their most profitable years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was, that ruling was five or six,
the period was five or six years ago,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they ruled that they absolutely had to
pay 280E that wasn't paid.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was a secondary ruling
that, there was a little bit of a victory
[SPEAKER_07]: lap taken about it, which was confusing to
me because the judge kind of had mercy on
[SPEAKER_07]: them and said, we're not going to apply
the 20% penalty kicker, but they still
[SPEAKER_07]: lost the case, and it's going,
I mean, I don't know what the exact tax
[SPEAKER_07]: burden is, but back of the envelope math
looks like that could be a nine figure tax
[SPEAKER_07]: bill.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was another case that showed that
management, the management company
[SPEAKER_07]: structures, that the IRS could pierce that
veil and could apply 280E taxation even if
[SPEAKER_07]: you're a management holding company.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you are part of the conspiracy and
then, therefore, you are touching the
[SPEAKER_07]: plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are incredibly concerning court
rulings that are coming down.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, Congress must act.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to fix this conflict.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has to go away.
[SPEAKER_07]: 280E will crush this industry sooner
rather than later if we can't make this go
[SPEAKER_07]: away.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the urgency that I see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the RICO cases are concerning,
but that initially went our way in
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado, but that's getting appealed up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So overall, I would say, look,
the federal government's never brought a
[SPEAKER_07]: preemption case.
[SPEAKER_07]: And probably the reason they haven't done
that is because they feel that they would
[SPEAKER_07]: lose.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this all goes back to Congress needs
to act.
[SPEAKER_07]: The courts are frustrated from what we're
seeing and what we're hearing from some
[SPEAKER_07]: folks from the bench.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're frustrated and saying,
we need direction here.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are people who are not violating the
law, who are abiding by a regulated system
[SPEAKER_07]: that are paying their taxes, but they're
violating federal law.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys need to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm concerned about the tax stuff
that's coming in the courts right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: The ideology of those being appointed to
the bench versus those who are being
[SPEAKER_10]: elected to Congress is significantly
different.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of, if you watch those who are being
appointed to the bench right now in the
[SPEAKER_10]: federal circuit, they're people in their
mid-40s, mid-50s, grew up in the era of
[SPEAKER_10]: just say no, very heavily law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_10]: Their world view is in a place that is
much different than both Republicans and
[SPEAKER_10]: Democrats.
[SPEAKER_10]: In Congress, you're getting younger
members, those who are directly influenced
[SPEAKER_10]: by what's going on in their states.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there isn't that same level of
influence that happens in the judiciary.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an independent judiciary.
[SPEAKER_10]: So in addition to the conflict and the
technical challenges, I think if you look
[SPEAKER_10]: at who's getting appointed, they're very,
very law and order types who come from
[SPEAKER_10]: that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm 47.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I remember that whole era too.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so just Congress is a better place for
us to fight these battles.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, let me add one more thing on the
judicial front too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone knew where Attorney General Jeff
Sessions was on this issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was never going to be helpful to
the industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're about to get a new AG, Bill Barr,
who went through his confirmation hearings
[SPEAKER_11]: a couple of weeks ago and said,
I know that businesses and states relied
[SPEAKER_11]: upon the coal memo.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the government pulled that away.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's unfair.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not going to enforce against them,
which was a huge moment.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, knowing that the new AG wasn't
going to come in and completely upend
[SPEAKER_11]: everything that you as business owners and
consumers had relied on.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's going through his meetings by
meetings with individual senators on the
[SPEAKER_11]: Hill.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're hearing consistently that what
he said publicly is what he's committing
[SPEAKER_11]: to them privately, particularly Corey
Gardner, who he met with on Tuesday or on
[SPEAKER_11]: Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a lot in terms of momentum
here, where at least we know the next
[SPEAKER_11]: Attorney General is not going to be
another Jeff Sessions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And speaking of Senator Gardner for one
second, Senator Gardner felt that AG
[SPEAKER_07]: Sessions lied to him and then went out on
the floor of the US Congress and put a
[SPEAKER_07]: hold on every DOJ appointment until he cut
a deal with the president for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who has ever done anything like that for
us?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a seismic moment.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I just want to kind of reiterate
Neil's point.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're in the industry, you definitely
need to pay attention to the RICO cases,
[SPEAKER_12]: the tax cases.
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, as activists, I think there's
something you can do in some of these RICO
[SPEAKER_12]: cases is to pay attention as to who is
filing them.
[SPEAKER_12]: In Oregon, like a winery filed a civil
like RICO case.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the winery then got bad publicity and
activists kind of say, hey, we're going to
[SPEAKER_12]: boycott your wine if you continue with
this suit.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in Oregon, industry estimates are that
41% of Oregonians use cannabis within the
[SPEAKER_12]: last month.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's a big market.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think activists have a role to step
up in some of these state RICO cases
[SPEAKER_12]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_12]: And with the race case, race Supreme Court
case, where the feds could still enforce
[SPEAKER_12]: federal law when a legal patient is
growing cannabis in their own backyard,
[SPEAKER_12]: not giving it to anybody else.
[SPEAKER_12]: Unlike the gay rights movement,
I think there's a lot of parallels between
[SPEAKER_12]: the gay rights movement and the cannabis
movement.
[SPEAKER_12]: Unlike that, we're not going to have the
courts save us.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so politically is where we have to
make the change because the courts aren't
[SPEAKER_12]: going to do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to change the law in Congress.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're almost out of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have time for maybe one more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it quick?
[SPEAKER_12]: Four more minutes.
[SPEAKER_12]: I got word.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here in California, we tried to lower our
cannabis taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't work out because the revenue was
going to go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: States and governments seem to be against
lowering syntaxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: 280E seems like one of the largest
syntaxes that's ever existed.
[SPEAKER_06]: With the states act passing, hopefully,
do we see revenue for cannabis businesses
[SPEAKER_06]: going to the federal government going down
or are they going to figure out some other
[SPEAKER_06]: way to get their money out of us?
[SPEAKER_07]: When the Congress passed 280E in 1982,
they never envisioned an industry like
[SPEAKER_07]: ours.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was, it's being, it's technically,
letter of the law is correct, but it is
[SPEAKER_07]: being misapplied to us and it was done on
purpose.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the states act fixes 280E.
[SPEAKER_07]: 280E penalty would no longer apply to
cannabis businesses who are, who are
[SPEAKER_07]: abiding by state law.
[SPEAKER_07]: The federal government will then respond
with trying to come at us with an excise
[SPEAKER_07]: tax.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's also part of the reason why
we've built such a great team.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how wonderful would it be as an
industry that we actually get to pivot
[SPEAKER_07]: from asking to be treated fairly and like
every other business and every other
[SPEAKER_07]: industry in the country to actually
advocating to not tax us out of existence,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is a tough position to take right
now while we're asking them to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, not seize all of our assets and
not take all of our profit through a
[SPEAKER_07]: provision and a tax code that was meant to
take all the profit out of illegal
[SPEAKER_07]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And 280E works as constructed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It works very well.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes all the profit out of your
business, but it shouldn't be applied for
[SPEAKER_07]: us and states act would fix it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for a great discussion.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just want to come back to the import
export discussion quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Under the states act, where do you see
things coming next in terms of the ability
[SPEAKER_09]: to export out of California or other
jurisdictions into other global markets?
[SPEAKER_09]: And secondly, back to the comment on
import saw this morning, a press release
[SPEAKER_09]: from a Colombian company was just approved
to export into Canada legally for the
[SPEAKER_09]: first time this morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, do you see that kind of coming
forward into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: market?
[SPEAKER_07]: Eventually, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: The states act just would end the conflict
between federal and state law.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it wouldn't open up international
borders.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, going back to my example with
Vermont, passing that first seismic change
[SPEAKER_07]: that actually changes the law and ends the
conflict is way harder than amending the
[SPEAKER_07]: law once it's on the books as we're
figuring out how to do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So of course, once the Congress says,
OK, this is a legitimate industry and all
[SPEAKER_07]: these businesses are not in violation of
the law.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then our full expectation is Congress is
going to move and they're going to move to
[SPEAKER_07]: set up regulation and they're going to end
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's going to open up all imports,
all exports, international markets,
[SPEAKER_07]: but probably not in this Congress.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: In Oregon, there has been legislation
introduced that would allow the governor
[SPEAKER_12]: of Oregon to introduce into agreements
with other states to export cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think once the states act gets
passed, then the pressure, kind of how we
[SPEAKER_12]: legalize state by state, we do the same
thing with exports.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you move state by state and get states
