[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm Alex Rogers, the CEO of ICBC.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here at the first Barcelona event
and we're teamed up with Spannibus.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Berlin, Zurich, Vancouver and
San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come check us out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're bringing it all around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe in general is taking off and your
markets here in Europe right now are in a
[SPEAKER_02]: space where if you're in now and you're
smart and you work hard, then something's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are the future of the European
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not all about America, it's not all
about Canada, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And today in Barcelona is absolutely
refreshing because it's great to bring a
[SPEAKER_03]: B2B element to Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the biggest B2B cannabis industry
event ever held in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's space for
everyone in each sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of what style of
business do you want to go about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to be big?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to be small?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think that there's room for
everyone in this space.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most importantly, we will see you
tonight at the W Hotel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please drive safely and enjoy your stay.
We'll see you tonight.
On the road to Messiah, on the street,
they're calling me!
[SPEAKER_01]: On the road to Messiah, on the street,
