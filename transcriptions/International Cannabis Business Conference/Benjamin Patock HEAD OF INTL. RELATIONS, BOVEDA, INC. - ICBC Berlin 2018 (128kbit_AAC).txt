[SPEAKER_00]: The second biggest online cigar retailer
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he is taking his knowledge into
the cannabis world as the head of
[SPEAKER_00]: international relations for Boveda,
the global leader in two-way humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please give a warm welcome to Mr. Benjamin
Potok.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we start, can I maybe use you for a
quick survey?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who of you actually knows or uses Boveda
by any chance?
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite a few people, but lots of potential,
which I love a lot, given the specs of
[SPEAKER_03]: this talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boveda, we basically only do one thing,
but this we do to perfection.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would regulate the humidity on the
inside of any given container to a
[SPEAKER_03]: constant level of humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do this for a myriad of use cases,
cannabis being an obvious one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, we would not be here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also do it for tobacco,
hence the title of my talk today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we basically only have one product,
and you see it right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's that little pouch.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have it in different sizes and
different RH levels for a myriad of cases,
[SPEAKER_03]: as I said.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also do it for musical instruments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, musical instruments, just as
guitars, violins, because they're made out
[SPEAKER_03]: of wood.
[SPEAKER_03]: So wood is exposed to changing humidity
levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would expand or contract,
and you don't want that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also do it for medical devices that
actually go inside of the human body.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see we have a product that's
actually very reliable and very safe,
[SPEAKER_03]: and at the same time inexpensive,
because we have the very modest goal of
[SPEAKER_03]: being present.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a flower that's present,
so we want to work with multinationals at
[SPEAKER_03]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we do want to work with consumers
around the globe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are some of the companies that we do
work with, some of which you probably
[SPEAKER_03]: know, some of which are here today even.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll rewrite there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in the industry for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, we're around for over 20 years in
the cannabis industry for roughly 11
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: About me, I joined the company not that
long ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was presented in the premium cigar
industry before I founded a company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked back to a career of an
entrepreneur, like 12 plus years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the last one was a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now one of the biggest online retailers
for premium tobacco and cigars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk a little bit about maybe
the similarities of the industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the products themselves,
they cannot be compared.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tobacco did a lot of terrible things to
a lot of people around the globe.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk about cigars, it's a little
bit different though, because cigars,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's still tobacco and still not good for
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have problems with your health
or you don't want to lead a healthy
[SPEAKER_03]: lifestyle, you should not smoke at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's given.
[SPEAKER_03]: But cigars are really like a lifestyle
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't really see people standing
outside in the rain, freezing,
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking a big Churchill for two and a half
hours, because they're addicted to cigar
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that you choose to do
because you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a luxury item that you choose to
consume either alone or with a circle of
[SPEAKER_03]: friends with the luxury of the time that
it needs to be consumed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet it's undoubtedly that this plant has
magical powers and that's why we're all
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want to talk about the
differences in the product per se,
[SPEAKER_03]: but how the product is being treated by
the stakeholders that are in the
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are indeed a lot of similarities
and a lot of challenges that I have been
[SPEAKER_03]: bouncing on and off in my last career and
that I see that could be very well
[SPEAKER_03]: possible in Europe going forward to full
legalization, full recreational usage,
[SPEAKER_03]: full adult usage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to talk about a bunch of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is regulations, because there's not
many things that you can be sure of,
[SPEAKER_03]: but one thing that you have to be sure of
is that regulators, they will be lazy
[SPEAKER_03]: enough not to come up with a unique idea
of how to treat recreational cannabis over
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will look left and right to other
highly regulated industries and will see
[SPEAKER_03]: what they can take out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will then look into tobacco,
you look into alcohol, knowing that in
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany, we're probably some of the
loosest alcohol regulations that there are
[SPEAKER_03]: in a westernized world.
[SPEAKER_03]: But tobacco, you can bump into a couple of
things and I'll just give you a quick
[SPEAKER_03]: rundown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Advertising, you're not allowed to
advertise tobacco products at all unless
[SPEAKER_03]: they're in a tobacco property or in a
retail storefront pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this could be very much a reality for
cannabis products too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though they're fully legal,
they still have the stigma a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: attached to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a very good possibility that
you're not be allowed, even though we're
[SPEAKER_03]: talking the future here, even though it's
100% legal, you might not be allowed to
[SPEAKER_03]: advertise your product and you have to
incorporate it into your strategy,
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously, when you're coming from abroad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tobacco products in Germany have a fixed
price.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means it doesn't matter if you buy
expensive cigar or cheap cigar,
[SPEAKER_03]: even at a gas station or a super high
retail outlet, high-end retail outlet,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're gonna have the same price
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is because the way of tobacco
products, how they're being taxed in
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany, they're taxed on the final retail
value towards the consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if this price would be changing,
then it would be like a whole mess in the
[SPEAKER_03]: administration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way you actually pay the taxes is
you would go to a government agency and
[SPEAKER_03]: buy tax stamps up front.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you give all the money that you have to
pay in taxes up front to the government
[SPEAKER_03]: and take a little stamps and put them onto
the boxes and then you're allowed to sell
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a possible outcome for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Could be, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is what is happening to millions
and billions of tobacco products all over
[SPEAKER_03]: the European Union every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Miners, of course, age is an issue with
tobacco and for good reasons and with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis it's gonna be the same,
no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, one thing that you have to
keep in mind, if there's gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: e-commerce for cannabis products,
what we have now in place in the European
[SPEAKER_03]: Union is like a two-tier age verification
system for tobacco products.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means that the age has to be verified,
A, before you complete the purchase
[SPEAKER_03]: online, and secondly, upon delivery of the
product itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is a two-tier step.
[SPEAKER_03]: TBD2 stands for tobacco product directive
number two.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a stupid word for something that
considers all the packaging that you see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you look at cigarette packs,
you have these nice shocking images that
[SPEAKER_03]: we have right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you have the same
everywhere around the globe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only have them for a couple of years
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it really comes down also on what
you're allowed to name your product,
[SPEAKER_03]: how to describe a product, because they
forbid anything that's related with food
[SPEAKER_03]: when it comes to tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we work with a company named Nectar of
the United States, and if they wanted to,
[SPEAKER_03]: as of now, come up with a tobacco product
named Nectar, they would not be allowed to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though they have the brand registered
globally, it's just because it's a food
[SPEAKER_03]: term.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it even goes to such length as if you
have a pipe tobacco that's flavored with
[SPEAKER_03]: vanilla, you're not be allowed to say the
word vanilla on the packaging,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though it has vanilla in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a food-related term, so you will
not be allowed to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And TPT-2 is only beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next step that's going to happen to
the tobacco industry is they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have a full track and trace with every
tobacco product because they want to dry
[SPEAKER_03]: out the gray market coming from other
European countries and even abroad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every single tobacco product has to be
completely traceable along the process of
[SPEAKER_03]: the value chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you better get your legal team ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though it's going to be tough to
say which of the regulations will be also
[SPEAKER_03]: facing the cannabis industry, if you see
something in neighboring industries that
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't like, you have to do lobbying
work against it now, because once it is in
[SPEAKER_03]: writing, it's going to be very hard to
fight it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second thing I want to talk about is a
little bit the stigma of the industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: because all the cigar smokers,
I get the same thing when I tell people
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm in a cigar industry, they're all
like, you don't look like somebody who
[SPEAKER_03]: smokes cigars.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, OK, so why is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have an image in their head
of Gordon Gekko type of business tycoon,
[SPEAKER_03]: or the other picture is my granddad,
he used to smoke cigars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, with cannabis, it's the
same.
[SPEAKER_03]: All users are a bunch of stoners,
even though I see Tommy Chong's brand out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So stoners get business people at some
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the drug addicts, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like the stigma.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like my dad, when I told him that I'm
going to a cannabis event, he's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, that's OK, as long as you don't start
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not immune to this, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not immune to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember my first cannabis show,
I was like, well, they have kids here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if this had been a wine event,
like a wine festival, it's completely
[SPEAKER_03]: normal to bring your family, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what I mean with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, once you go down the road of
full legalization, you get a vast variety
[SPEAKER_03]: of products are coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thus, it means that you're going to
have to build a brand, because all the
[SPEAKER_03]: tobacco products that we have in the
market right now in Europe and around the
[SPEAKER_03]: globe, they're not sold by protocol.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is because product quality is really
hard to assess for a consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always say, if you go to like wine
tastings, like 65% of what is talked there
[SPEAKER_03]: is just pure bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like in the tobacco industry,
it's like 95%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis is somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: So brand is that what will differentiate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will sell your product not about the
product quality, because people will have
[SPEAKER_03]: a binary decision about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like it or they don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like it maybe, but it works fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works for them, and it helps them,
or it doesn't help them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps better than other products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always like a binary decision
that's involved in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the brand is actually the cognitive
anchor that helps transporting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're going to buy something because
they like the story, because they like the
[SPEAKER_03]: design, because they like the persona that
represents that brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that we use when we
brought new tobacco products, new cigars
[SPEAKER_03]: into the market for positioning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we talk about product quality,
obviously, we should take a step back,
[SPEAKER_03]: because quality, when we look at any
definition, it always says that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: measured.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing is measured against something
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we measure is our expectations
versus what we perceive of that product or
[SPEAKER_03]: service.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, what is important is it's
never constant, because perception
[SPEAKER_03]: expectations, they will change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can't even change from something
you don't even have in the realm of your
[SPEAKER_03]: own control.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it can be that you have a perfectly
good quality product, but your competition
[SPEAKER_03]: raises quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden, your product is just good
or OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to work with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And quality is like the beginning of
everything, and the entire loyalty value
[SPEAKER_03]: chain, if you want to put it this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you take your perceived quality
and measure it against the cost of
[SPEAKER_03]: obtaining a product or service,
you will come up with something that's
[SPEAKER_03]: called value.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the perceived value is higher or equal
to what you expected, you'll be satisfied.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, you're not going to be satisfied.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're satisfied over a longer period
of time, then you develop trust,
[SPEAKER_03]: which will mean that you have a positive
idea about the future outcome of that
[SPEAKER_03]: relationship that you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: On top of that, this will develop into
repetitive behavior and, finally,
[SPEAKER_03]: repeat purchase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you eventually, all these factor in,
will become loyalty, which means that you
[SPEAKER_03]: will become an advocate for that brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something that everybody in
this room hopefully wants to achieve,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the B2B or B2C setting.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we talk about cannabis quality,
of course, there's some things how we can
[SPEAKER_03]: assess cannabis quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabinoid trippy profile is one thing
that we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water activity is actually a metric that
is super important in food safety today in
[SPEAKER_03]: all the food-related industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just beginning today to talk
about it when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, contamination,
hopefully, lack thereof.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all things that we can measure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And water activity, which will translate
to the free or unbound water within a
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the stuff that's going to
evaporate first, or that's the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to be available for
biochemical reactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need this all along the value chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a curing bond from a tobacco
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tobacco, how you produce it and proceed
is you dry it, then you cure it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called fermentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you store it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fermentation takes sometimes years
for tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the one difference is that every
retailer in the world that sells premium
[SPEAKER_03]: cigars will store their products at a
humidity-controlled place or storage or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same is true for consumers,
because they know that they're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have a bad product experience when the
product is too dry, or that they will lose
[SPEAKER_03]: everything to mold when the product is too
moist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for cannabis, we have the same effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But not that many people know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consumers, they don't know anything about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the industry now, we're starting to
discuss it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not only because dry flower also
means light flower, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So everything is really attached to water
activity in the plant, because we have to
[SPEAKER_03]: remember that we have a plant that's in
decay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we cut it from its nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beginning to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the processes, and they're all
tied to the water activity level in the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, some of the processes are highly
wanted, we call it curing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some, especially towards the higher
end of that segment, we basically don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want, because we don't want to lose
everything to mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is why we need a maximum level of
water activity as a quality standard in
[SPEAKER_03]: today's cannabis industry looking into the
future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the maximum level is around 0.65 of
water activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Told you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also need a minimum standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we did is we took cannabis flowers
into a lab for a pilot study.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put it into a closed container for six
weeks and measured the cannabinoid terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: profile before and after.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found an average loss of 15% of
terpenes and cannabinoids over that short
[SPEAKER_03]: period of time in a sealed container,
I have to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens, if you know a little bit
the biochemical compounds, you see that
[SPEAKER_03]: these are pretty robust little things
usually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't decay that easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what happens is that your plant dries
down, and the trichomes on your plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: they simply break off when you're too dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: This effect is being magnified when you
stir it, shake it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once you start shipping flower from
Canada, into Europe, from Israel,
[SPEAKER_03]: into Europe, from, I don't know,
Colombia, into wherever, you run the risk
[SPEAKER_03]: of losing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially nowadays, you all probably
heard, everybody likes these MyLove bags
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're so handy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's impossible to keep out of the
little corners and niches.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just lose it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's face it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can avoid it by having a humidity
control with your cannabis along the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably the most sold
prescription that we have in Central
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe by Bedrocanon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even this container is leaking about six
milligram of water per day in dry
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which will mean that with the five gram
dosage that we have here, the difference
[SPEAKER_03]: between, let's say, .62 water activity and
.55, where you start losing your
[SPEAKER_03]: trichomes, is basically just 100
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have not even three weeks,
in the worst case scenario, where you
[SPEAKER_03]: start losing some of the medicinal value
of that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So humidification control device or
technology would be an obvious reply to
[SPEAKER_03]: that problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And usually they're made of three
components.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is water, because if you want to
re-humidify something, you need water in
[SPEAKER_03]: that mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a controlling agent.
[SPEAKER_03]: This could be, right now, the predominant
factors are salt or glycerin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a membrane that would just let
the water pass through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And would keep the controlling agent
inside of whatever you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to just give you a really quick
rundown of these two technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we have here is a salt and water mix
that's actually set to 62% relative
[SPEAKER_03]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this can actually lose up to a third
of its weight before you actually start
[SPEAKER_03]: going below that .55 mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: With glycerin, you're going to get to that
point really fast, at just about 2% weight
[SPEAKER_03]: loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have all this red area there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be fair, the graph below really
ends just at the half of what the graph
[SPEAKER_03]: above is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why is that so?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because when you use salt,
you have the unfair advantage of using
[SPEAKER_03]: different salts that have different
deliquence points.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's like a breaking point where any
salt goes from solid into fluid states.
[SPEAKER_03]: And above and below which, the salt would
change from absorbing water to releasing
[SPEAKER_03]: water again.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like when you go to a restaurant,
you have salt on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't add rice or anything,
it will get really clumpy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would attract the humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it will also dry out again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we take advantage of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: With glycerin, it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have only one glycerin compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can achieve different humidity
levels just by adding or removing moisture
[SPEAKER_03]: from the very same mix, which means that
once you have one of those packs
[SPEAKER_03]: activated, it will simply create an
equilibrium between the pack itself and
[SPEAKER_03]: the biomass that you're trying to humidify
or to dry down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it will never stay at 62.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you add this to moist condition,
it will continue to take on the excess
[SPEAKER_03]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can easily grow mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it dries down, you can go into the
red area again as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really about protecting your
craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always compare it to riding a
motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can ride a motorcycle without a
helmet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a cheap motorcycle helmet,
it's better than no helmet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you really care of what's inside
your helmet, then you should use a
[SPEAKER_03]: salt-based humidity agent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a company came over there who
has a patent on the salt-based humidity,
[SPEAKER_03]: just putting it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is why we choose salt over
glycerin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because it's much more performant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not only about product quality,
of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about the top-line revenue on top of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you only want the snapshot of one
chart, it's probably this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what we wrote down, how much money
you actually lose from drying your butts
[SPEAKER_03]: on a pound of cannabis, this is how much
money you can lose when you dry it down
[SPEAKER_03]: too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you know that the only thing you
have to do is add a little pouch with a
[SPEAKER_03]: value of cents to the dollar, I just leave
it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The last thing I want to talk about is
something that I call big corporations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everybody, of course, loves big
corporations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not against it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they bring so much value to the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the whole level of
professionalism and the marketing power,
[SPEAKER_03]: they pave the way into the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just want to share a last story with
you that even these guys have their own
[SPEAKER_03]: agenda.
[SPEAKER_03]: For instance, in the cigar industry in the
United States, a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: the FDA came up with a new ruling when it
comes to introducing new products into the
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to go to extensive lab testing
all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a lengthy and very costly
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would think that especially
companies with a large number of SKUs,
[SPEAKER_03]: they would fight against it, but they
didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is because they figured out that
while they have the power actually of,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, it's 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should light one up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they didn't fight because they found
out basically that it's probably easier
[SPEAKER_03]: for them just to let the small companies
die or reduce their rate of bringing new
[SPEAKER_03]: products into the market than because they
have the money to afford the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other companies don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they did nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you should support the activists right
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are different lobbying groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't mind if I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different lobbying groups that you can
support right now in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you should do it right away from
scratch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are many ways you can be
creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a friend who is a Jewish baker out
of Florida, and he teamed up with a Muslim
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's growing ornamental flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're getting ready to go for a
gross license once Florida goes online.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's really using his religious
community in order to put pressure on the
[SPEAKER_03]: decision makers in this lawmaking process
in Florida, literally telling them,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to be hunted down by a bunch
of angry rabbis, and you don't want this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't really help you with this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a Catholic, but I'm going to leave
you with that nice image here and a bright
[SPEAKER_03]: future for all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you very much for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have time for one or two questions if
anybody has any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: No questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even like, hey, can I get a hit of
your vaporizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: No?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alex has a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think the main,
I actually didn't see your entire
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe covered it, Benny.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I did see was very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for being here,
dude.
Pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think the main crossover,
like the main crossover point for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and your industry is?
[SPEAKER_02]: And are there any other industries that
that's an analogy or compared it to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the main crossover point for Europe
is that people spool here like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you mix tobacco with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is for recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is that, I mean,
for me, it's really the different types of
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation that could possibly come into
play.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if you saw that part,
but I spoke about it just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will have to know that this is
going to be a heavily regulated industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: no matter what.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even we will be granting broad access to
the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will not be easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: My best educated guess right now is that
it will be available through pharmacies,
[SPEAKER_03]: for Germany at least, because we have a
very elaborate system and they know how to
[SPEAKER_03]: store and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but we don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all up to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lobbying groups like Deutsche
Handverband and GEOC, they guys are making
[SPEAKER_03]: great progress here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to support them now in order to
move it into the right direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when Germany goes wreck, do you ever
see cannabis not being sold in pharmacies?
[SPEAKER_02]: In Germany, or maybe some type of social
club model in the more progressive
[SPEAKER_02]: northern cities like Köln, Hamburg,
Berlin?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in Berlin, they try to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, do you think that could ever get
legs?
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really comes down to our leadership,
which is right now very conservative in
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very conservative leadership.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once there's a shift, and the old people
will die eventually at some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: But apart from that, if that changes,
I think everything could be possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they're going to make the
same mistakes that they did with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to avoid it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tobacco is just so widely available.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have to put all the warning labels
and shark images in place to keep people
[SPEAKER_03]: from buying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, they make so much money
out of it that they won't go into
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition because people would go crazy
and they earn a shitload of money out of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would be something in between
tobacco and the pharmacy model.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be my way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there will be some tolerance
allowed when it comes to that social club
[SPEAKER_02]: model?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it will be kind of this quasi
little underground thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that culturally that's
possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like they do in Spain?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think that Spain is going to
be modeled for Germany because that's not
[SPEAKER_03]: how Germans are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there is something there,
though?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be in a controlled
environment because the social clubs that
[SPEAKER_03]: you see in Spain, they're out of reach for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: The police would go in there and
eventually try to get a hold, but they
[SPEAKER_03]: can't because it's all covered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany would not let this happen,
especially since they would look abroad
[SPEAKER_03]: like everybody else would do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look abroad in different industries,
into different countries, and they will
[SPEAKER_03]: see what's happening in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still have a large black market,
even though you have the model right
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coffee shop, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we have special dispensaries,
but why shouldn't the dispensary be just a
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmacy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you again very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's here again for Ben Paddock.
Thank you.
Thank you.
