[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're coming up, oh,
there we go, keeping the legacy alive,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That is an interesting topic because up
until now, cannabis has been one of the
[SPEAKER_07]: biggest success stories of
decentralization, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, capitalism trying to capitalize,
they wanna centralize everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an interesting thing, we're gonna
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to lead this panel, the founder and
CEO of Green Rush Consulting, let's hear
[SPEAKER_07]: it for Zeta City!
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for Zeta City!
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for Zeta City!
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hey, hey!
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: How you guys doing out there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah!
[SPEAKER_08]: How's everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name's Zeta City, I'm CEO and founder
of Green Rush Consulting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're here to talk about culture of
cannabis, keeping the legacy alive and
[SPEAKER_08]: corporate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got four panelists up here today,
very special people.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the far end down here, we have Aaron
Smith.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the co-founder and executive director
of National Cannabis Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_08]: Aaron has successfully built coalitions
with elected officials on both sides of
[SPEAKER_08]: the aisle in order to advance cannabis
policy reform, legislation in the state
[SPEAKER_08]: capitol, and among the public.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please welcome Aaron.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next up, we have Luna Stahler,
Vice President of Business Development.
[SPEAKER_08]: I aspire a cannabis company focused on
high-end consumer vaping technology.
[SPEAKER_08]: Luna earned her place as a thought leader
in the California cannabis industry by
[SPEAKER_08]: helping to shape the retail landscape.
[SPEAKER_08]: Driving sell-through in both mainstream
and niche markets.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a women-grown cherry woman,
she hosted networking events with
[SPEAKER_08]: world-class brands and was a founding
member at the first two events in
[SPEAKER_08]: California music festival history,
legally vending cannabis and motor lights
[SPEAKER_08]: in grasslands.
[SPEAKER_08]: She also held work on social equity in
Oakland and decriminalized entheogens and
[SPEAKER_08]: plant-based psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody welcome Luna.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next up, we got Needy Lucky Honda.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lucky, huh?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're so lucky to have her.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Needy was the founder and CEO of Rude,
a California lifestyle brand forged on the
[SPEAKER_08]: principle of radicalizing the common
narrative surrounding cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_08]: with a focus on propelling a multitude of
topics like inclusivity, restorative
[SPEAKER_08]: justice, and cannabis industry etiquette.
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome Needy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And finally, we have Lisa Hogg.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lisa Hogg is the founder of MJ Universe,
a publisher of digital products and a
[SPEAKER_08]: collaborative network to connect companies
along the value chain of hemp and
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lisa is also a founding member and on the
board of the BVCWEV and a member of the
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannifer network, a professional network
for women, hemp, and cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody give it up for her.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so here we go.
Ready?
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit of history, though,
of cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you feel overview?
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, cannabis is amazing these days.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it started with really, at least in
the Jamaican Rastafarian culture back in
[SPEAKER_08]: the 1850s and 1860s, really kind of
bringing it to the fold and then moving
[SPEAKER_08]: into the California counterculture in the
60s to then under Prop 215 from medical
[SPEAKER_08]: and then Denver, Washington going full
legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're seeing legalization all over the
place now internationally.
[SPEAKER_08]: 18 legal states and 37 medical states in
the United States and now an international
[SPEAKER_08]: marketplace potentially worth $146 billion
by 2025.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to start with some of our
first questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please tell our audience what each of your
businesses are seeing out there today in
[SPEAKER_08]: terms of how the legacy market is being
impacted as legalization is becoming
[SPEAKER_08]: mainstream.
[SPEAKER_08]: Aaron, you want to tell us a little bit
about that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thanks, Ada.
[SPEAKER_09]: And thanks, ICBC and all of you for being
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great to learn from what's happening
here across the pond and share ideas with
[SPEAKER_09]: all of these great folks up here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really have been watching the industry
really from a very U.S.-centered focus as
[SPEAKER_09]: leading the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: Trade Association.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not going to speak for Europe,
but what we see is that as we have done a
[SPEAKER_09]: really great job of moving public opinion
in the right direction away from
[SPEAKER_09]: prohibition, switching state laws over and
over and over again to 37 states with
[SPEAKER_09]: medical, 18 with adult use.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the good side of that is that means
there are less arrests, but on the flip
[SPEAKER_09]: side, we have not done enough to create
regulatory regimes that are accessible to
[SPEAKER_09]: minority-owned businesses, small
mom-and-pop operators who were at one time
[SPEAKER_09]: legacy operators, meaning they were
operating in the previously unregulated
[SPEAKER_09]: market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we need to be doing a lot more both
at the federal state and local level in
[SPEAKER_09]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: to open up these markets to everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think about that in terms of
the legacy market being impacted by
[SPEAKER_08]: legalization?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was born and raised in Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in middle school in 1996 when Prop
215 was passed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So cannabis was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never considered it a drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for me, my entire community and my
perspective is that it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been a patient since you could be a
patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been selling it, smoking it and
growing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: My entire life, it put me through grad
school and it's brought me where I am
[SPEAKER_05]: today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to see the extinction event happen to a
lot of the legacy farmers that weren't
[SPEAKER_05]: considered during the regulatory process
and were left out, as Aaron's mentioning,
[SPEAKER_05]: when I use the word extinction event,
I mean that in the literal economic term
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's been multiple of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say maybe 90% of the people
that we used to work with before it was
[SPEAKER_05]: made legal a few years ago are no longer
in business for various reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, everyone knows that capitalism
is in a lot of ways a game of greed if
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not conscious capitalism.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of got a predatory perspective
and unfortunately with capital,
[SPEAKER_05]: you have more play in this space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so a lot of our job is to make sure
that these things are not lost and we stay
[SPEAKER_05]: grounded in our roots, whether it's as
Frenchy Canole says, the terroir of the
[SPEAKER_05]: place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in Northern California, we have a very
special Mediterranean type climate that
[SPEAKER_05]: grows a specific kind of cannabis with
certain cannabinoids and terpenes and
[SPEAKER_05]: profile that is really rich.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're proud of that heritage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to lose that from just making
something that's a magical, mystical,
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal plant into a typical consumer
packaged goods, there's something lost
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're here to really just remind that
there has to be some purpose and respect
[SPEAKER_05]: for this plant and the plant medicine and
everything we do and not just treat it
[SPEAKER_05]: like it's another consumer good because
it's really not, it needs to be treated in
[SPEAKER_05]: a special way or else we're going to
destroy it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's really, really important
because the fact of matter is it comes
[SPEAKER_08]: from the culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the folks that built this
industry, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So having to be able to resonate with that
is super, super important in the way she's
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, wouldn't you agree, Neeti?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, tell us a little bit about what
you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I run a brand based in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like Luna, my perspective is very
California centric.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're watching the cultivators,
loon supports, craft cultivators.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really make not just a concerted
effort, but it's part of our ethos.
[SPEAKER_03]: To buy flour from small farmers that they
are getting pummeled right now as we're
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing the big corporate grows come
online.
[SPEAKER_03]: The economy of growing is upside down in
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs $700 a pound to grow and
cultivate.
[SPEAKER_03]: The market's at 300.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in 2022, we're hearing about farmers
killing themselves every day in
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is an extremely volatile moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot that the New York Times
and other markets can learn from this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really unbelievable because the thing
to really focus on for all of us here
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in this business is the best
behaved part of the supply chain is the
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the problems we have in this
industry are man-made.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can control and do things differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say that's the big thing that
we're seeing at loon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm very, very well familiar with the
California market.
[SPEAKER_08]: But learning from the California market is
very, very important.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we take it all the way across the
world over to a place like Germany,
[SPEAKER_08]: Lisa, give us your thoughts on some of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think in general, it is very
important that we learn from each other
[SPEAKER_01]: and that we try not to only create these
local markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you look at Europe,
for example, there are individual zones
[SPEAKER_01]: like you know from the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in the end, it should all be
that we are more connected and that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: lobbying also for changes in global drug
policy that we can create a global
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry where it is not only
like individual markets where you then see
[SPEAKER_01]: these effects like these price drops way
more than if you have a harmonized system
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can trade and you can exchange
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not only stuck in their local
markets, but I think it's very important
[SPEAKER_01]: with the countries that are a little bit
further ahead that we learn from them,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we as entrepreneurs exchange and just
learn from the mistakes also that happened
[SPEAKER_01]: in other more further developed areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and these folks, I mean, you
understand that they've been traumatized
[SPEAKER_08]: in a way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Multi-generational farmers who have known
just as the way they need to operate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And education is so important to help
bridge the gap and create that conduit
[SPEAKER_08]: between your business and the consumer,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'd like to actually roll that into
this next question, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: since each of you guys, you know,
someone have a little bit different of
[SPEAKER_08]: businesses, how are you guys, you know,
tell our audience actually how your
[SPEAKER_08]: business and shuttle is currently
connecting with consumers at that level
[SPEAKER_08]: that resonates with industry culture?
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to go, Luna, you want to try it
out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we do dope hardware.
[SPEAKER_05]: We lean hard into the concept that this is
a beautiful high end luxury lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just for losers and stoners and
lazy people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have dab rigs that are induction
heating that are really high in
[SPEAKER_05]: technology, but still are a nod to the old
school dab culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't know what dabbing is,
it's high temperature vaporization through
[SPEAKER_05]: something like a bong, but it's
specifically for concentrated THC or any
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrated cannabinoid really for
usually for people who have a really high
[SPEAKER_05]: tolerance and they want a lot of THC or
they want to have a custom experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for us, we're able to have,
you know, bring technology and innovation
[SPEAKER_05]: into a space that really hasn't had much
innovation.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are still using the same pipes and
joints that they've been using for,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, 40 to a hundred years,
however, you know, apples or whatever you
[SPEAKER_05]: find.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for us, we're really trying to be
sophisticated and polished and show the,
[SPEAKER_05]: the cannabis consumer and to normalize it
culturally and also to investors or to
[SPEAKER_05]: people who are on the fence about it,
to legitimize it as this business,
[SPEAKER_05]: but also not leave people behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of brands that will brand
themselves like as anti stoner and they
[SPEAKER_05]: put that down to define themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, we like I wear, you know, everyone on
our ice fire team, if anyone came by our
[SPEAKER_05]: booth, you'll see we wear plug necklaces.
[SPEAKER_05]: In California, the plug means you're the
connect.
[SPEAKER_05]: You hook people up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the Yenta.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're the matchmaker.
[SPEAKER_05]: You, you want to, you want to get people
what they need.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's actually a form of like love and
respect and flow and you're the hook.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we, we, we, we wear that to show
that whatever you need, we got you on
[SPEAKER_05]: that, whether it's policy, whether it's
parties, whether it's culture,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's dab rigs, the fate pens,
it doesn't really matter where you're at.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's if you're, you know, contributing to
the normalization of this plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's what we're all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have, you know, we always focus on
hiring women, people of color,
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to incorporate as many folks as we
can.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we partner with people where you give
preferential attention and support to
[SPEAKER_05]: people that have marginalized backgrounds,
queer folks, people who are giving back to
[SPEAKER_05]: nonprofits.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do a lot of corporate social
responsibility work.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do beach cleanups and we give back
where we can, because if you're not
[SPEAKER_05]: giving, you really shouldn't be in this
space.
[SPEAKER_05]: This plant is giving in its nature.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I would love to actually jump to
you, Lisa, with MJ universe, which is a
[SPEAKER_08]: platform that's providing access to
experts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, education is key here,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So tell us, Lisa, how, how are you guys
abridging that gap?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for us, it's all about explaining
cannabis to mainstream businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also a lot of my clients, for example,
are pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know anything about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really start from scratch about
explaining what the plant does about the
[SPEAKER_01]: contents and bringing across this
potential of cannabis to conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: industries that exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like if you talk about the stoner
stereotype, for example, I think this is
[SPEAKER_01]: often also abused in certain ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we, for example, in Germany,
we just had a raid in a supermarket.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a promotion for hemp products,
but it was all labeled as hash brownies
[SPEAKER_01]: and all these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had little rasta people on it,
which is like really like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not acceptable exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the end, it was all about hemp
products and they didn't make use of this
[SPEAKER_01]: vast potential that is in the hemp
nutrition that they could have used
[SPEAKER_01]: easily, but they decided to take the
stoner stereotype, make it red,
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow, green, and then put a rasta man on
it, which is really a lot of cultural
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriation also.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that raid was unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Nidhi, tell us a little bit about how
your products are connecting with
[SPEAKER_08]: consumers, your business in general is
connecting with consumers in the
[SPEAKER_08]: California market.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is everything that we think
about every day at Loon as a brand that is
[SPEAKER_03]: really focused and committed to building
out a new narrative, telling new stories
[SPEAKER_03]: about the 3.0 consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is possible for our industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all understand that there is a
lot of potential here, which is why we're
[SPEAKER_03]: all here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But creating that bridge, telling the
stories, both the social justice reform
[SPEAKER_03]: stories in a palatable way to a consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put out a quarterly magazine at Loon
called Honestly Grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: It marries lifestyle, so there might be a
feature about how to style your weed cart
[SPEAKER_03]: instead of having a bar cart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also tells a story about social
justice reform and how we can actionably
[SPEAKER_03]: get people out of prison for serving these
nonviolent cannabis crimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that every single one of
us should be very not just passionate
[SPEAKER_03]: about, but feel as a moral imperative as
part of our work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at Loon, we take that as part of our
mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really, you see it in the packaging
is recyclable, the little details that
[SPEAKER_03]: really like feed into, we know a lot about
cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They care about Mother Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: They care about conscious consumerism.
[SPEAKER_03]: How that outlays and how we market and
message I think is so important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's part of everything really in the
brand ethos.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that bridges the culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's really getting people to feel
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Palliative stories.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Palliative stories around your brand,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And also focusing on a lot of the issues
and challenges.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Aaron, I'm sure you can give us a
little bit about that with NCIA in terms
[SPEAKER_08]: of a lot of issues and challenges in terms
of restorative justice and how that works.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we put this in perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been facing nearly 100 years of
marijuana prohibition at the federal level
[SPEAKER_09]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_09]: That prohibition policy was put in place
to subjugate people blatantly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's face it, it's not people that
look like me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's to subjugate black and brown
communities.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we absolutely, as we move away from
prohibition, we're still in prohibition.
[SPEAKER_09]: But as we move away from it, we absolutely
must ensure that the industry does
[SPEAKER_09]: everything it can to try to repair the
harm associated with the previous
[SPEAKER_09]: policies.
[SPEAKER_09]: And NCIA is always there educating
entrants into the industry because we are
[SPEAKER_09]: the first place that many people go when
they're coming in to try to find their
[SPEAKER_09]: place in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And making sure they understand what that
history is and what our new role is.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is a once in a lifetime
experience that we're, or once in a
[SPEAKER_09]: lifetime opportunity that we are all
engaging in here and creating a brand new
[SPEAKER_09]: industry and an industry that we could
just, you know, cede it to big tobacco,
[SPEAKER_09]: big pharma, big alcohol.
[SPEAKER_09]: But no, we're making sure that we stick to
the values that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: taught to us, you know, through the legacy
of the cannabis plant and the previous
[SPEAKER_09]: industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a big part of us.
[SPEAKER_09]: NCIA is being kind of part of the bully
pulpits, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_09]: On the policy side, there's a lot going on
at the state and national level,
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of focus on national.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I look at the work we do is
really kind of bifurcated into two tracks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Lobbying Congress and the administration
to pass the kind of ultimate perfect
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana bill that's going to,
you know, that will have all the bells and
[SPEAKER_09]: whistles that we all want to see in a land
where marijuana is legal coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then also what we can get done like
today or in the near future.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's politically possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: On the more comprehensive legislation
side, there are something like seven
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis bills in Congress.
[SPEAKER_09]: We support all of them to some degree.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're really excited about a new bill
coming out, though, that kind of brings
[SPEAKER_09]: elements from all of them from Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be out before the election,
which we're really focusing on lobbying
[SPEAKER_09]: him and his office to understand the need
to include restorative justice measures in
[SPEAKER_09]: that legislation to ensure that if there's
a federal licensing system, which will be
[SPEAKER_09]: proposed, that we don't have arbitrary
caps on those licenses, that the barrier
[SPEAKER_09]: to entry, capital requirements,
et cetera, are at a point where,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, not just anyone can get a
license, but anyone with a reasonable
[SPEAKER_09]: acumen can get a license federally.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then leave a lot to the states.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to leave as much as possible to
states because the states have been the
[SPEAKER_09]: laboratories of democracy all along.
[SPEAKER_09]: On the kind of what's more practically
likely to happen in the next couple of
[SPEAKER_09]: years, I think the biggest, most important
policy objective we're working on is a
[SPEAKER_09]: piece of legislation in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: called the Safe Banking Act, which would
allow U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: banks to do business with cannabis
operators and licensees without fear of,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, getting there, you know,
getting shut down by the feds.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also would allow the cannabis industry
to access financial services without being
[SPEAKER_09]: gouged.
[SPEAKER_09]: Many of them are being gouged with
exorbitant fees just to deposit their,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, deposit their cash at the end of
the night, not to mention they don't have
[SPEAKER_09]: access to lending and traditional lending
and financial services.
[SPEAKER_09]: This bill would allow, would open up those
opportunities, which are really mostly
[SPEAKER_09]: needed by the smaller operators.
[SPEAKER_09]: The big multi-state operators have,
they have private sources of capital and
[SPEAKER_09]: are not as dependent on things like the
Small Business Administration and other
[SPEAKER_09]: mechanisms that we have for small business
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey guys, can we give another round of
applause for NCIA doing this type of work
[SPEAKER_08]: for us?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: This really paves the way for new
entrepreneurs to get into this space,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, and provide something called
legal amnesty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like let's just say you're here now in
Spain and you're doing stuff underground.
[SPEAKER_08]: This type of work really helps us pave the
way for the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: So really thank you guys so much for doing
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And speaking of legal amnesty,
you know, in new markets, it's critical to
[SPEAKER_08]: support these folks because we're seeing
this happen in states like New York.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it happened in California.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've created measures or ways of
supporting these folks and bridging them
[SPEAKER_08]: from the unregulated market to the
regulated market.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, also bridging the gap between
culture and corporate here, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: in multi-generational farmers,
you name it, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just kind of wondering,
you know, with each of you guys'
[SPEAKER_08]: businesses, like what is your business
doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you doing to support these folks
who have been targeted by the war on
[SPEAKER_08]: drugs, let's say, you know, to create
opportunities to work with them in these
[SPEAKER_08]: new types of markets?
[SPEAKER_08]: Luna, do you want to give us an idea what
iSpyre is doing in that space right now
[SPEAKER_08]: with all the work that you've done?
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we actually just ran a holiday
gift that we donated instead of,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, spending a bunch of money to
send something.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sent a custom.
[SPEAKER_05]: We make a wand, which is a torch
replacement.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had them custom painted by our friend J
.V.
[SPEAKER_05]: Arti.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a well-known artist.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we made a sizable donation per gift
that we gave away in that person's name to
[SPEAKER_05]: the Social Impact Center, which is founded
by two women of color in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are working on basically the drug
war.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people who have been disproportionately
impacted by the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So usually people of color, people that
live in highly policed areas and really
[SPEAKER_05]: working on initiatives to make sure that
they are able to vote afterwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they can participate in democracy,
that they can get good jobs, that they're
[SPEAKER_05]: able to move forward in their lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, really the most important thing
for us is autonomy, sovereignty,
[SPEAKER_05]: and everyone being able to do exactly what
they need to do for themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's people that we work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our partners is Xzibit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a well-known rapper.
[SPEAKER_05]: He started a company called Napalm.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is, you know, an African-American guy,
you know, was famous for selling weed and
[SPEAKER_05]: rapping about strippers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And doing this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's been able to raise a cannabis
company in a state that traditionally
[SPEAKER_05]: locks people up with people that look like
him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He would be locked up for doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If he didn't have, you know, the proper
lawyers and the proper capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're seeing people rising up from
situations where they used to go to jail
[SPEAKER_05]: for selling weed to being someone that a
young person of color can look up to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we fill their hardware.
[SPEAKER_05]: We offer them their cartridges.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go into California and you buy one
of Xzibit's Napalm's cartridges or one of,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we have a custom battery for
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're able to, like, uplift different
people in our spaces.
[SPEAKER_05]: Women-owned businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: I work with a lot of women-owned
businesses, too, that we're able to do
[SPEAKER_05]: extra promotions for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give them extra love on social.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're able to really make sure that when
they're going through their processes that
[SPEAKER_05]: we can be a true partner to them and show
up for them with intentionality instead of
[SPEAKER_05]: just using them to check boxes off of our
list.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually have Jessica Redenbo,
our marketing director right here in the
[SPEAKER_05]: audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's also a woman of color and an amazing
advocate and activist who's been in the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated market and pre-regulated market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she runs our, you know, our brand and
our events.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she very much puts herself into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, like, having women and people of color
and marginalized people at the center of
[SPEAKER_05]: the decision-making is different than just
hiring a couple people to work the front.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to have them in positions of
leadership and in positions of management
[SPEAKER_05]: and in positions of ownership,
as well, and stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of companies will do these things
where it's all about optics and PR.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just want things to look good,
so they'll check boxes obligatorily.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just, it feels very perfunctory.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't feel authentic and genuine.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need people to actually step up and
really be sharing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we were talking earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know in Germany, Lisa was saying that
it's, people are, you know, there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: brain drain.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are leaving their industry because
they're not making enough money.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rich people are not sharing with the
workers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have all these brilliant people
who know how to grow, who know how to do
[SPEAKER_05]: these things that are leaving because it's
an abusive environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So making it a really safe space,
connecting with women's groups.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do a ton of work in women's
empowerment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just going out of your way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cutting out time and cutting out budget to
really overtly do this work with these
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it really coalesces with their brand
message, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because at the end of the day,
it's going to be flowers, flowers,
[SPEAKER_08]: flowers, flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's really important to have
this message and do this work for the
[SPEAKER_08]: communities and for all these different
types of folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would imagine, you know,
you guys are doing just as good as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, kudos to you guys at iSpyre
because, you know, I think that's all we
[SPEAKER_03]: all need to show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at Loon, we've been really dedicated
to that from the jump.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I first started the brand and
literally had no money and was very eager
[SPEAKER_03]: to keep mission central to everything that
we do, I went to last prisoner project and
[SPEAKER_03]: said, hey, guys, I don't have any money,
but I want to support you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we, we have an amazing creative team.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we create content?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we start amplifying the message of
what you're trying to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: We started there and today we have a skew
on the menu all the time at Loon where
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% of the proceeds go to mission,
like last prisoner project.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I really think it's
important that at every level in our
[SPEAKER_03]: industry just show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, today I think the most impactful
work we're doing at Loon is with an
[SPEAKER_03]: accelerator called Momentum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a phenomenal program.
[SPEAKER_03]: It supports underrepresented minorities
and folks disproportionately affected by
[SPEAKER_03]: the war on drugs by giving them 50% of
$50,000 with no strings attached,
[SPEAKER_03]: no equity requirements in their brands,
helping them succeed, putting them through
[SPEAKER_03]: a 12-week program, teaching them things
like, you know, how important compliance
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's phenomenal to me as somebody who has
a brand, how many founders I meet who
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have budgets for compliance.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best way we can help the legacy market
bridge the gap is by really educating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to Luna earlier, you know,
mentioned we need to stop using this
[SPEAKER_03]: blanket term education.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to flesh it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Education on compliance and really
understanding the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like there's a massive gap right
now for folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you're running a
billion-dollar company and you have an
[SPEAKER_03]: entire team of lawyers dedicated to
compliance, those are not going to be the
[SPEAKER_03]: same friction points that if you're a
small mom and pop trying to just put
[SPEAKER_03]: products on the shelf and you don't
understand that the California Universal
[SPEAKER_03]: Triangle now has to be a quarter of an
inch instead of a half an inch,
[SPEAKER_03]: that can screw up your entire business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, you know, it's really I'm very
passionate about the work that Momentum is
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sit on the committee and as a brand,
we also sponsor that initiative
[SPEAKER_03]: financially.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in general, I think the message should
be just show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it is the beach cleanup,
if it is showing up in whatever way,
[SPEAKER_03]: put your value system first.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're in an industry where that's
incredibly critical more so than in any
[SPEAKER_03]: other emerging industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's obviously the money grab mentality
that's dominating most of the
[SPEAKER_03]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I think mission and
authenticity is something that will always
[SPEAKER_03]: shine through loudest and proudest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately, the consumer will choose,
you know, brands that really and companies
[SPEAKER_03]: that really show that off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know who's showing up for you guys
over here in Europe is Lisa right here for
[SPEAKER_08]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give her a round of applause, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's doing a great job for Germany.
[SPEAKER_08]: Women empowerment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us a little bit about what's
happening in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Germany, it's very interesting what
is happening at the moment because we have
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit different background than you
have in the states, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: like compassionate use programs would not
be possible for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a very different environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could not do recreational grow and then
hand out medicine to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's two different systems in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also something that you can see in the
medical market is that is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also something that at Rosenthal,
I don't know who of you saw his talk
[SPEAKER_01]: prior.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said there are the people who do the
work and the people who got the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to make sure a little bit more
that more money comes to the people who do
[SPEAKER_01]: the leg work and who are doing the ground
work in terms of patient education for the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical part, for example, which are
patient associations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are mostly self-funded or have
small donations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like we need to make sure that this
big corporate money also goes down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: grass root and helps grow the cannabis
plant that we are planting at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not that everything just stays in the
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people who have been in it for the
long run and who have been working in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry for 20 years plus, that they
cannot participate and are overrun by huge
[SPEAKER_01]: mainstream corporates.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's important, as any business,
really, having just the good hiring
[SPEAKER_08]: practices or good vendor selection that
really encourages these folks to
[SPEAKER_08]: participate.
[SPEAKER_08]: That includes training and empowerment
programs.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so many different things you can
do in this industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why this industry is amazing
because there's a lot of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've just got to look at it at the right
lens.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why it's important that all
these women are just doing such a great
[SPEAKER_08]: job.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all doing just such a great job.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've got to do it collectively
together.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what we're doing here today at
ICBC is sharing this information,
[SPEAKER_08]: sharing these strategies and solutions so
that all of us can benefit from one
[SPEAKER_08]: another, countries to country,
state to state, person to person.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys so much for all the great
work that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Round of applause for our guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go for one more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lastly, moving from a legacy market to a
regulated market, what are four tips that
[SPEAKER_08]: legacy cannabis companies can do that you
can tell our audience on how they can
[SPEAKER_08]: survive in a world of corporations coming
in that have larger access to capital,
[SPEAKER_08]: refined systems, and scalability?
[SPEAKER_08]: Lisa.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four tips for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four tips.
[SPEAKER_08]: What you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think one very important thing is
to collaborate and to make sure that all
[SPEAKER_01]: this knowledge that has been built up over
the last years is not lost somewhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is transferred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And education, I think, is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody should focus more on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, it's part of our job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I would also wish more for would
be that the companies understand that
[SPEAKER_01]: especially this part is helping people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have over 200,000 cannabis crimes in
Germany that are prosecuted every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is part of our corporate social
responsibility, if you want to put it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the manager word, that we are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are not only there to open up this
market, to grab market share, but we are
[SPEAKER_01]: also there to give something back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nidhi, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_08]: Four tips for new legacy cannabis
companies to survive the upcoming market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think number one, educate yourself
and use the expensive mistakes other
[SPEAKER_03]: markets have made.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is free, and everybody should
take advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We already paid for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Invest in compliance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I touched on this earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we see this all the time with
folks that we work with who've come from
[SPEAKER_03]: legacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There seems to be either a real resistance
or this perspective that it's too
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be foundational to every
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd say embrace innovation and
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we need to hold hands more.
[SPEAKER_03]: The legacy markets and the newer corporate
markets need to hold hands because if
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to build something that we can
all be proud of, it's going to happen
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need the money from the new corporate
entities, and we need the experience from
[SPEAKER_03]: the legacy market professionals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last thing is stay true to your
roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing that corporate weed is never
going to have over legacy is a real story.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's built in.
[SPEAKER_03]: That authenticity really shines through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can look at any brand,
you can look at any CPG vertical in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world, and ultimately, consumership
gravitates toward authenticity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is something that you have with
timing and experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we should be celebrating that
as an industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, those are my four tips.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Integrity, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Integrity.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Luna, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dang, that was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't prepare anything, but it's just
like my typical rule.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's get the job done.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the efficiency part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be focused on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be focused on what the other
person's doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be focused on anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hire someone to do compliance so that you
can focus on your IP, your day-to-day,
[SPEAKER_05]: your culture, your people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get the job done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, your assignment is to liberate
this plant and make this just like coffee
[SPEAKER_05]: or sugar or any other stimulant.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the mission.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter who you work for.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter where you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter how you talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get the job done.
[SPEAKER_05]: The assignment is to legalize and create
more access at an affordable rate to this
[SPEAKER_05]: plant and to stop putting people in prison
and harming them, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's always look out for your
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't step on other people to get where
you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't act like you invented a strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't rip off people's IP.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people in the cannabis industry
where we're from fight internally.
[SPEAKER_05]: When really it's us against them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's our government.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the stigma.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of inter-fighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's another thing I say is look out
for your mates and have fun is a really
[SPEAKER_05]: important thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember why you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have some levity.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really important to remember stay
centered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a story of a why, why you're in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be able to tell people with joy and with
pride and with honor that you're in this
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them know that you're there for them
and maybe you guys can share a truckload
[SPEAKER_05]: instead of each of you paying for
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys go together in coalition build.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call it cooperation, not competition.
[SPEAKER_05]: A rising tide raises all boats.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all on the same team.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fourth piece is just cover your
ass.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lawyer up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get your money right and get your lawyers
right because it doesn't matter what panel
[SPEAKER_05]: you go to, what your friends say,
what anyone else says.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless someone is being paid to follow the
laws that change constantly, the goalposts
[SPEAKER_05]: get moved and you're being asked to play a
game where the rules are changing and the
[SPEAKER_05]: stadium changes locations on a daily
basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you're getting some gray hairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's very stressful.
[SPEAKER_05]: So be flexible, be adaptive and cover your
tush because people are losing their
[SPEAKER_05]: livelihoods.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're getting arrested.
[SPEAKER_05]: And where I'm from, the cops will come,
they'll shoot your dog, they'll take your
[SPEAKER_05]: kids and they'll take your trucks in your
house and you'll have nothing left and you
[SPEAKER_05]: have a felony and you can't vote or in
certain states you can't vote and in
[SPEAKER_05]: certain places you're not able to get a
job.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a real war that's happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a civil war.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a civil rights war so just watch
your back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not cool everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Spain it's very serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're arresting people constantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just remember where you are and don't
get too comfortable because it's not legal
[SPEAKER_05]: yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Aaron, what you got?
[SPEAKER_08]: Four tips.
[SPEAKER_09]: I absolutely agree with everything said
here and following up on what Luna said,
[SPEAKER_09]: definitely invest in a good attorney.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not just being worried about the
police kicking in the door.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also make sure you're working with
the right people.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of predators out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of sharks that are trying to
come in, especially going after legacy
[SPEAKER_09]: operators and trying to strike a deal just
so that they can get wealthy and bounce
[SPEAKER_09]: out of the industry when really we're here
to stay and need to make sure that we have
[SPEAKER_09]: that long-term mindset.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also just I think one of the most
important things when I see successful
[SPEAKER_09]: legacy operators as they enter into the
market, don't stay isolated.
[SPEAKER_09]: Connect with other people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Learn from your, I think you said
cooperation and not to give a shameless
[SPEAKER_09]: plug for trade associations, but join the
trade associations that represent you and
[SPEAKER_09]: give to politicians who support you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Show up and speak your mind to those who
maybe don't or are on the fence and be
[SPEAKER_09]: visible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those who kind of hide out and think that
they're going to be able to lay low and
[SPEAKER_09]: not be affected by policy changes or
regulatory changes or the criminal justice
[SPEAKER_09]: system.
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost always eventually fail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys, give it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one of the best in the industry
right here, right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got 10 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to do some Q and A with some of
the brightest minds in the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody want to come up with some
questions, feel free.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd love to answer them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jason, modern extractor podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to add one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming to what you guys were just saying
about the advantages or advice for legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: brands entering into the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your biggest advantage is the network that
you've had having to operate as a legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a huge thing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use those relationships because the big
corporate big bad wolf doesn't have them.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean having the relationships is very
important as you bridge that because you
[SPEAKER_08]: can actually share connections.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can share those types of
resources.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for adding that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really, really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what you do with the modern
extractor podcast, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because like that's what we're talking
about when we're saying education.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you're bringing people on to talk
about extraction, which is not as like
[SPEAKER_05]: sexy of a topic as like some of these
other things, but you're empowering people
[SPEAKER_05]: to be able to do it themselves and
teaching a man how to fish for himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're a perfect example of just one
person just having a microphone,
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing people on, but that's going to be
played thousands of times, hopefully more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, you know, that's a great
example.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of a common question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually just recently relocated to
Europe from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: after having been in the industry for
about seven years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And part of what I realized is that most
of the topic around legacy market kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: focuses in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: on the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't feel like there's enough
information about working towards medical
[SPEAKER_06]: and honoring the medical system.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: specifically, we've really gone in the
direction of recreational because that's
[SPEAKER_06]: where the money is.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm noticing over here in Europe is
that that's different.
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like Lisa has some things to add
on that, that the culture is just
[SPEAKER_06]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a lot of these are kind of North
American specific problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no war on drugs over in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there is a war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there has been their own,
but yeah, of course, each of us has their
[SPEAKER_06]: own.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just think it's going to have a lot
more education and testing and a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: the compliance centric that we're really
going to benefit from back in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm really excited to see what Europe
does with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it's going to be a really
good thing for us as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lisa, do you want to add on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, definitely if you think about
standards, there is no real cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these standards have to be developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a step ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think like for the European
ecosystem, we need to create our own and
[SPEAKER_01]: look at what is happening in other areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, for the medicinal
cannabis, but especially for recreational,
[SPEAKER_01]: it shouldn't be so strict, but still there
should be a safe product for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you think of the legacy market in
Europe, what are these brands that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: here as legacy brands?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the seed banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the bongs, accessories, stoner media,
all these kind of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the legacy brands that we have
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the real cannabis producers,
there are no brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would agree with her on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want you to make sure that you can
differentiate between medical and adult
[SPEAKER_08]: use.
[SPEAKER_08]: Medical absolutely has a totally different
path through science and education and
[SPEAKER_08]: really the therapeutic uses of cannabis,
which has been done for thousands of
[SPEAKER_08]: years, whereas adult use is more like the
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_08]: So important to understand those
differentiators.
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you for adding that to this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm glad that we can cover that too as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Question to the women on the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel that some of the projects
you've been talking about community and do
[SPEAKER_04]: you feel that women in the industry are
more ready to collaborate even right the
[SPEAKER_04]: way up to the CEO level?
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where a lot of the change is
happening by the women pushing these good
[SPEAKER_04]: causes, whereas the men don't necessarily
want to talk about it as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luna?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's definitely been my experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back when Women Grow first came out in
2015, I was one of the Bay Area chapter
[SPEAKER_05]: heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the willingness and the ability.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's just because women
are typically codependent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just say yes to everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: We give away free consulting all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it definitely feels like camaraderie.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's something shared with
marginalized people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also a Jew too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's this thing about when you meet
another Jew, there's this love of you kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of understand me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And women just know without having to say
anything that we have to work extra hard
[SPEAKER_05]: and our ideas are not always considered
valid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will say something that a man says
and it'll be ignored until he repeats it
[SPEAKER_05]: and then it's heralded.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's these microaggressions and
these small violences every day that wear
[SPEAKER_05]: at your self-confidence and at your
ability to really show up fully.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when women see that and support
each other, it's not that men don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that there's no way for someone
who has a majority culture that privilege
[SPEAKER_05]: can ever really understand how hard it is
to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once you start adding
intersectionality events, sexuality,
[SPEAKER_05]: race, all of that stuff, then there's
black women or queer black women and all
[SPEAKER_05]: those things you have on top of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we like to support each other because
it just feels like there's already stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: that doesn't have to be said and we just
know that we're there for each other in
[SPEAKER_05]: ways that I wouldn't say I've always been
welcomed in by men.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to prove myself to men.
[SPEAKER_05]: Women automatically accept me for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just add to that and say that I think
that part of what we've seen evolve in the
[SPEAKER_03]: market and in America is this really
intense sense of competition, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: really mis-founded because the reality is
that there's so much white space even
[SPEAKER_03]: right now in the industry in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this idea of collaboration and
cooperation is actually intrinsic to the
[SPEAKER_03]: plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a female plan at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been using it forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never going to stop, whether it's
legal or it's illegal or whether it's
[SPEAKER_03]: stigmatic or it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think women are really like,
you know, we're seeing this in the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States, the amount of secret chats and
groups and, you know, it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an incredibly misogynistic industry
in the states.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you as a woman of color running
a brand in California, I've experienced
[SPEAKER_03]: sexual harassment, physical assault.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a really intense industry to be a
part of.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the good news is, is that folks like
us, everybody in this room, is,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, awake and that we have these
conversations because the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_03]: exponentially grow is, like, it's
boundless.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think when we have these kinds of
conversations and Luna and I are looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at each other, you know, rolling our eyes
half and also half, like, so excited
[SPEAKER_03]: because we see the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see, you know, I'm always open to
collaboration as a brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't view my fellow CEOs of other
brands as competitors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I view them as part of the same class.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we all have the same PTSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all have the same adrenal fatigue.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all getting beaten up at the same
rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's hold hands and do it together
because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_03]: the enemies, the real enemies of our
industry are tobacco, big pharma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, let's be real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we need to be focused and be aligned
and work together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's massive, so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to thank and congratulate all
the speakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have been brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when it comes to education,
it's very hard for us to talk without
[SPEAKER_02]: expressing the need to work with schools
and at the university level because we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to prepare all the health
professionals on this subject,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to believe that things are
going to change if you don't involve
[SPEAKER_02]: schools and universities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, the biggest organizations,
corporations in the world that lead with
[SPEAKER_02]: education, like UNICEF, UN, and UNESCO,
World Bank, and all the institutions that
[SPEAKER_02]: finance the education around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have the subject on the
manuals, on the textbooks, in schools,
[SPEAKER_02]: in different areas, in different degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why, for example, I am at this
point organizing the International Expo on
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp and related with cannabis in Lisbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: On June 18 and 19, we are in Lisbon
talking about all these subjects and
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing not only politicians and
entrepreneurs and this and that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also journalists who need a lot of
this preparation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Schools, universities, June 18 and 19 in
Lisbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And congratulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's two things happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, there's a conspiracy because of big
pharma that doesn't want people to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: their own and they also don't want doctors
to learn about the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's like that private interest and
that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, until this is not federally
illegal in most countries, none of these
[SPEAKER_05]: other banking institutions, everything has
to come from decriminalization,
[SPEAKER_05]: or from de-scheduling it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to come down from being a hard
drug because none of these people,
[SPEAKER_05]: they all have lawyers, even like
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Their lawyers just read.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannot promote the use or sale of drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Promoting the use could just be smoking.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just, the lawyers of all these
things are just reading the laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the banks, it's not really up to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Until we decriminalize, no one's gonna get
on board to put it in schools.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we need lobbying.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just waiting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even think that there's like a
cultural like, I don't even necessarily
[SPEAKER_05]: think that they're doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I just think that we need to
remember that until we, they're waiting
[SPEAKER_05]: for the green light.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people are actually gonna be
excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, Harvard Medical School,
I'm sure wants to teach about the
[SPEAKER_05]: endocannabinoid system until they feel
like they can do it without losing their
[SPEAKER_05]: federal funding.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a gag rule.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a literal gag rule.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will not give you federal funding if
you teach these things in schools.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well guys, this is all the time we have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give a round of applause for our panelist
here and ICBC too as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys so much.
Thank you.
