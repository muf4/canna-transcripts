[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us Laurie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi everybody Gosh, what a year it's been.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we were just here last year,
but it's it's also been really long It's
[SPEAKER_02]: been a long year And a long January 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got to go fast and there's a lot
to cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big state So let's just dig right
in What are some of the top 2020 Bureau of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Control?
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulatory changes to expect I'm seeing
emergency rules about QR codes I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: wondering if there's anything gonna be new
in lab testing or Coming for retailers or
[SPEAKER_01]: distributors and certainly I'm hearing a
lot about metric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although that might be on the DFA side
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as most of you know, we just Released
our emergency regs for the QR code require
[SPEAKER_02]: retailers to post their QR code to help
Consumers make informed decisions to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure they know they're going to a licensed
retail shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that just got released We of course had
some legislation that was passed last
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are looking at SP 34 the compassion
care We had to make some changes in metric
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to accommodate that and all three
licensing authorities are working on
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations so that's gonna give folks in
the supply chain the ability to donate
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to to folks that Yeah,
that really need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so That's coming up really soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty exciting and then we've
been working on a variety of changes So it
[SPEAKER_02]: really encompasses a lot but a lot of
cleanup changes looking at the three
[SPEAKER_02]: Licensing authorities over the last couple
years, you know, some people have pointed
[SPEAKER_02]: out there's some inconsistencies So what
for example menu, you know CDPH is written
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't really work when it gets down to
distribution So a lot of that cleanup
[SPEAKER_02]: we're looking at so I think you're gonna
see a lot of things coming down more You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, there's a lot of confusion on
ownership I think how the Bureau looks at
[SPEAKER_02]: ownership is slightly different than the
other two and so all that needs to be
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaned up because if You're gonna apply
for a license.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be fairly consistent between the
three licensing authorities What
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation is Bureau of the Bureau of
Cannabis Control watching in 2020?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the governor just released his
Budget package and talked about a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of agency consolidation potentially
potentially moving Streamlining taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you what are you watching?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's salient in this new year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think there's a couple of things
obviously the streamlining of taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's important to everybody even
When we look at you know where the point
[SPEAKER_02]: of collection is gonna be that may change
things for the Bureau But I think you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at things like trade samples may
pop up again So I think we'll be watching
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that Maybe what's even
happening on the hemp front?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, does that fall under you know a
regulatory structure and then of course we
[SPEAKER_02]: will be watching how things develop with
consolidation That's probably a big one,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Just to jump off on consolidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a timeline around that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this a fast-moving thing or a
slow-moving thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean that's all relative to the
speed of government in general,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you are gonna see some changes
fairly quickly when it comes to Really
[SPEAKER_02]: just starting to have a plan of what
consolidation is gonna look like and what
[SPEAKER_02]: that leadership is gonna look like So
we're all you know reporting to the same
[SPEAKER_02]: chain of command.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what's going to take probably
Anywhere from 12 to 18 months is really we
[SPEAKER_02]: all have we all are located in different
facilities and really Geographically
[SPEAKER_02]: getting everybody in one place or deciding
where people are gonna be I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: does take some time I think anything I
mean depending I you know at at the state
[SPEAKER_02]: level I don't know what's what you
consider quick to what we consider quick
[SPEAKER_02]: But in my you know, if we get this done in
the next 18 months, I think that's that's
[SPEAKER_02]: a pretty huge accomplishment and that's
fairly quick and I think the Important
[SPEAKER_02]: thing is is that the industry it's smooth
with the industry I mean there's gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of work to do within But as long as
we need to still be making sure we're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting those license applications out
that we're answering your question So
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully as quick as we're moving the
industry isn't affected by it too much
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of your success metrics or
goals for 2020 at the Bureau of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Control?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that seems to change every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So well I'm gonna tell you I mean,
it's pretty exciting I mean for us It's
[SPEAKER_02]: always the priority is making sure people
that are qualified to have a license and
[SPEAKER_02]: want a license we get them licensed I mean
the more people we can get licensed
[SPEAKER_02]: working with the local jurisdictions to
educate them making sure we're helping
[SPEAKER_02]: them to To approve some of these licenses
and then you know enforcement I think for
[SPEAKER_02]: the next couple years is going to be a big
priority and making sure we're still have
[SPEAKER_02]: our You know foot on the pedal of going
after unlicensed activity across the state
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously consolidation is gonna be a big
priority For us and you know, I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a great opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Think the fact that we're all gonna be
one agency is it just makes sense And I
[SPEAKER_02]: think in a lot of ways it makes it's
combining all of our priorities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's gonna Be in a lot of ways for
the folks out in the audience that works
[SPEAKER_02]: with California It's gonna be really nice
when you can go to one place For your
[SPEAKER_02]: license search to see you as a license one
place to apply for a license.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I mean us Streamlining that
process and making it More business
[SPEAKER_02]: friendly for the consumer to apply for a
license and get information I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: is gonna be the goal for this year to make
sure we do that right because I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important We do that right is the BCC
fully staffed up house staffing looking
[SPEAKER_01]: this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we got annual Licensing going on
and these are two separate questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what hiccups can people avoid common
hiccups?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they avoid an annual licensure?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so we're we're getting we've staffed
up a lot You know within the bureau we're
[SPEAKER_02]: close to a hundred employees We are we are
almost fully staffed in our licensing and
[SPEAKER_02]: really probably the biggest hiccup we find
with people is just a lot of just just
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that When we reach out to
folks a lot of times it takes time to get
[SPEAKER_02]: things back But I think a lot of people
have trouble with the application Maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: what they need to do maybe not
understanding what they need for like
[SPEAKER_02]: providing us And I think the biggest thing
I can say is like please reach out to us
[SPEAKER_02]: have that Everybody here if you have an
application with the bureau You're
[SPEAKER_02]: assigned a licensing analyst to work
one-on-one with you with your application
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're having trouble with that
application we want to know we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: walk you through it and So I think instead
of like anything else when sometimes you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't understand what you need to do you
tend to put that off Oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we all do that I do that and I think it's
like just let you know Whatever we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: do to work through that application.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good news is is it for the annual
application?
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of you are getting provisionals and a
lot of times we can get those provisionals
[SPEAKER_02]: out and then we can slowly work with you
to get those annual requirements So I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's not gonna keep you from doing
business So I would always encourage you
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever we need for that Provisional get
that to us first so we can get you in a
[SPEAKER_01]: provisional and then we can work on all
the rest Is there a BCC help phone line?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you considered doing one of those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's a good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point So we do have a phone
line that can reach directly to our
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing people and I know you're gonna
ask me for it right now and I It's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get you it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll get you it but it's more to
your point me 1-800 BCC.
[SPEAKER_02]: We yeah we Yeah, that's what we do need
that We need a vanity number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm stuck Yes, we we do have that
number, but I think I like your idea We
[SPEAKER_02]: need like that vanity number so it's easy
to get ahold of us and with more people it
[SPEAKER_02]: allows us to be more accessible And I
think we're trying to you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not everybody wants to be communicated by
phone someone email, but somewhat tech So
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're gonna see us exploring more
Of hey how maybe asking you on the
[SPEAKER_02]: application?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you prefer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes communicate to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're making some changes to the
application where we're gonna ask those
[SPEAKER_02]: questions So then we know what your
preferred method of communication is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is But I think it's good We're also
looking at doing a lot more in the
[SPEAKER_02]: application process putting little help
boxes We find that there's a lot of things
[SPEAKER_02]: we can head off by just putting those
things and so we're really looking at How
[SPEAKER_02]: that application is online and and trying
to make some really needed changes to it
[SPEAKER_02]: to make it easier for you So you don't
have to call us up that you got the answer
[SPEAKER_01]: right there How's your email response
times I got a couple social media
[SPEAKER_01]: questions about like I'm having trouble
getting an email response back Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I you know I you know I could I think I'm
gonna say we are we're really responsive
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially on the the questions that we
answer on a regular basis We those are we
[SPEAKER_02]: got those right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We even have a database that we house
those on on our website, which is your
[SPEAKER_02]: questions answer It's a searchable
database.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always say on some of the questions like
unique business models that we get Those
[SPEAKER_02]: do sometimes take longer, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we don't know the answer and we
are and sometimes we have to contact
[SPEAKER_02]: public health And food and ag because it's
sometimes it involves all three and so we
[SPEAKER_02]: do Just so you know we meet every week to
talk about email questions We're not sure
[SPEAKER_02]: how to deal with and have a consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know Sitting around being like
this guy wants to run a rental trimmer
[SPEAKER_01]: agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't have any pot but Anyway,
that's my job.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have creative questions,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're creative ones like Ice cream
trucks Well, there's all sorts of things
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys have great Ideas and we got to
keep up with all those great ideas one
[SPEAKER_01]: question people have is what is the future
of lounges?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certainly a number of consumption
lounges They tend to be locally licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: and the BCC has seemed to been copacetic
with that yeah, really lounges is is more
[SPEAKER_02]: of a local jurisdiction issue and We that
is really if the locals allow a lounge
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the time There's not going to be
an issue with the BCC unless it's
[SPEAKER_02]: violating some sort of regs But so far we
haven't had any issues with the the social
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption lounges that have been issued
there could be some out there that we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know about that we could have an
issue with but But yeah, that's more at
[SPEAKER_01]: the local level and so yeah You know one
thing you guys do have is 85 events like
[SPEAKER_01]: events licensees this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you speak to?
[SPEAKER_01]: That licensing space it seems like there's
a lot of them as it means we're gonna have
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of events this year What's your read
on the event?
[SPEAKER_01]: this awesome events license that no other
state has and California cannabis tourism
[SPEAKER_02]: in general Well, I just was at a present.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand Michigan sort of copied ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so Yeah, I don't know anybody from
Michigan supposedly they they took what we
[SPEAKER_02]: did, you know, I I feel like I hope that
we get a lot more event Temporary events
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some really big ones last year,
you know, we have had Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also had Grasslands which was under
also it was huge and it really went off
[SPEAKER_02]: with it with no issues at all And so I
think we you know If you go back two years
[SPEAKER_02]: when the statute only allowed you to have
temporary events on on fairgrounds or
[SPEAKER_02]: district agricultural Places and then that
got changed to allow for it could be
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere where the jurisdiction expressly
approved I think we thought there'd be a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot more event licenses and I don't know
that we've seen That and I think the
[SPEAKER_02]: locals are really trying to figure out
where the best place to have these things
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really am optimistic that we're gonna
have a lot more of these this year What do
[SPEAKER_01]: you tell people who ask I mean so much of
this stuff is local What's the best way to
[SPEAKER_01]: affect local change that you've seen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stories that stick in your mind where
locals really changed their environment I
[SPEAKER_01]: think of people running referendums or
taking City council seats I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know that last year Yeah, I mean I
think all of that at the local level has
[SPEAKER_02]: to come from the constituents of that
jurisdiction and really Engaging with the
[SPEAKER_02]: local politicians though that that that's
a full that could almost be a full-time
[SPEAKER_02]: job because that you know that you have to
be on top of that and so I think also
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot has to do with they're also
struggling with resources they have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of other issues they're dealing with in
their jurisdiction whether you know
[SPEAKER_02]: homelessness and housing and all those
things so I think the more you can keep
[SPEAKER_02]: them informed about what's going on with
cannabis and the statutes and and just
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping them educated is also you know a
really valuable thing and if you know of
[SPEAKER_02]: like a local jurisdiction that seems to
want to do cannabis regulation,
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe they don't know where to start
we're happy to If we know what we'll step
[SPEAKER_02]: in and send people there and and really
talk with them about it because you know
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure they get really good
information So if you think there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: jurisdiction out there that's struggling
that you think would be valuable for us to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to we're happy to do that as well I
saw for the first time that the League of
[SPEAKER_01]: California cities this Association of
California cities that does a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: lobbying They not only have model ban
ordinances on their website, but for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time they have actual model
dispensary ordinances and it struck me
[SPEAKER_01]: that the lack of institutional support
over these years has left these bewildered
[SPEAKER_01]: citizens who you know are in charge of
their locality kind of Gun shy about
[SPEAKER_01]: moving forward on a lot of this stuff Do
you see any more institutional support
[SPEAKER_01]: emerging to support locals who again
remain bewildered and outgunned in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of the legal innovation required to do a
local ordinance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think you're you're seeing We you
know one of the things we did do last year
[SPEAKER_02]: was release the local social equity grants
We award ten million dollars to ten
[SPEAKER_02]: jurisdictions We there's now go biz just
announced another round of Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a close to 30 million and they're
They're also going to be giving out grants
[SPEAKER_02]: to local jurisdictions and intend to do a
social equity program so I think that's
[SPEAKER_02]: really going to Really you're gonna I
think you're gonna see more local
[SPEAKER_02]: jurisdiction looking at cannabis
regulation look at in social equity
[SPEAKER_02]: programs So I think you're gonna see some
of that change Also, you know because we
[SPEAKER_02]: get so many questions from the local
jurisdiction I think people if you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: from California you forget we have over
500 different cities and counties that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have to interact with it's it's it's huge
And yeah, and we're finding locals are
[SPEAKER_02]: asking more questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're expanding We have a local liaison
unit and their sole responsibility is just
[SPEAKER_02]: to work with that local jurisdiction
answer their questions We having a
[SPEAKER_02]: dedicated phone line So they're not
waiting for answers because we want them
[SPEAKER_02]: to get answers so they can answer you as
well So I think you're gonna see hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to be optimistic that that's
gonna change this year How many stores do
[SPEAKER_01]: you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: California new ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well the state might license this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's actually state and local I see
the licensee numbers come out every week I
[SPEAKER_01]: see new stores opening in places that have
never had them I see cannabis commerce
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to places That never even
considered medical cannabis commerce,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know talking to some experts like
Amanda over at Canada regs We're guessing
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe two or three hundred more
stores might join the mix this year What
[SPEAKER_01]: do you see in that temple?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would I'm hoping that happens
I think when you look at our population
[SPEAKER_02]: and a number of retailers I mean,
I mean really it's you know with the
[SPEAKER_02]: number of yeah I mean we want people to
have access to legal cannabis and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't do that when you have pockets of The
state where people can't access legal
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis unless they have to drive several
hours So we want as a state, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We want them to be able to access places
that have their cannabis tested to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure they're there You know paying their
taxes their packaging and labeling and so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really I'm hopeful to see Increased
access at the retail level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's good for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for your district I mean,
we have more distributors and retailers
[SPEAKER_02]: right now, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right and I am seeing again like there's
500 plus cities or counties Even if of a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred of them just do one or two stores
for the first time it makes a measurable
[SPEAKER_01]: impact It would how many we have going
right now when you look back at 2019 What
[SPEAKER_01]: do you consider the biggest wins of last
year?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I as I recall you were telling the
LA Times that there was not a single
[SPEAKER_01]: confirmed case of exclusive use of a
Licensed store vape product associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with injuries last year but yeah when you
when the clock struck Midnight,
[SPEAKER_01]: what were you happy that you know,
you got done last year Well, I obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: the equity grants getting out there and
awarding grants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's pretty incredible and when
you look as California's the leader on
[SPEAKER_02]: that and I think you're watching other
states take notice of that So I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: was a huge thing enforcement we increased
our our enforcement efforts with starting
[SPEAKER_02]: different techniques We increased how many
search warrants were serving on unlicensed
[SPEAKER_02]: places We're getting better at our tactics
of keeping them close to so we're not
[SPEAKER_02]: going in and they're opening up the next
Day, but we looked at tactics like we sent
[SPEAKER_02]: landlord letters basically warning the
property owner if you're allowing your
[SPEAKER_02]: Tenant to continue doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna take action against you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all those Trying to find different
tactics and different things to go after
[SPEAKER_02]: the unlicensed market and then I you know
really stepping up our public awareness
[SPEAKER_02]: Campaign that's probably been the biggest
thing for us is really trying to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: word out there to consumers to try to
change those habits to to to encourage
[SPEAKER_02]: them to go to the legal market and why
it's important to go to the legal market
[SPEAKER_02]: and And the and the QR code, I mean,
honestly, I I think we've been just trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to attack it at all fronts What work do
you see is left undone?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've touched on a lot of it in
this talk so far but is it Just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be consolidation this year streamlining
licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are what what is the big priorities?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, obviously, you know our Stakeholders
are always going to be a priority.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make and I said this earlier
and I can't say it enough I mean you want
[SPEAKER_02]: us to be on very Nimble when it comes to
processing your license applications and
[SPEAKER_02]: getting you licensed and making sure we're
responsive to you But also on the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time we have to make sure we have the
infrastructure to support that so continue
[SPEAKER_02]: to staff but consolidations is a big part
of that, but I'm pretty confident we can
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we can get that done and
streamline that I'm looking forward to you
[SPEAKER_02]: know Making sure that when you go to a
web, you know, you go to one website for
[SPEAKER_02]: all of us I mean who wants to go to three
separate licensing websites to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out what you need to do So those
are some simple things we can do over the
[SPEAKER_02]: next few months that I think is gonna make
your lives a lot Easier, what does your
[SPEAKER_01]: read on the overall industry health?
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly there's been some layoffs and
Some people who've been bemoaning,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the high tax and regulation
environment here in California or the
[SPEAKER_01]: lowest the slow speed of local
implementation When you look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: dashboard for the California cannabis
industry at the legal side.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that dashboard reading to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm always gonna I always take I
feel like we're speed dating right now so
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly I I'm always gonna be optimistic
cuz What happens?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'll be honest with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It surprises me every day what I think I
know Like two months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh gosh, I you know Yeah,
it changes and and so you got to meet you
[SPEAKER_02]: got a roll with the punches so I'm I'm
optimistic that things are gonna look up
[SPEAKER_02]: and And I think as long as you're engaged
and you keep us in making sure I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: say if I if I ever get asked by any other
state, what's the most important thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is making sure you're working with your
stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening to your stakeholder I
sort of say you got to keep your egos in
[SPEAKER_02]: check as regulators, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times we need to just listen We
don't need to always be the ones talking
[SPEAKER_02]: and as long as we have a relationship
where there's that mutual respect I think
[SPEAKER_02]: we can accomplish a lot of things over the
next year couple More questions one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see Los Angeles adding any new
stores this year in the city limits due to
[SPEAKER_01]: Issues around licensure there and who gets
them and the speed of rollout there is the
[SPEAKER_01]: city of LA which is the biggest market in
California and arguably the world Where is
[SPEAKER_01]: the BCC going to help them or is that
really on them to sort out?
[SPEAKER_01]: You stand ready to issue the licenses to
who they license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we stand ready, but at the same
time, you know They have a they they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have an easy process to get through and so
we're always there to help them They're
[SPEAKER_02]: one of our equity grant Recipients and so
we're gonna start and and one of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: things you're gonna start seeing is us
going around the state Looking at doing
[SPEAKER_02]: workshops licensing workshops to work with
the local jurisdictions and to help our
[SPEAKER_02]: applicants navigate Having the locals
there to help them navigate the local
[SPEAKER_02]: process then having the state there to
have applicants Navigate the state
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we see some of these equity grants
getting awarded we're gonna start stepping
[SPEAKER_02]: in and doing these workshops and I think
it's gonna be helpful to a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: local jurisdiction, so I You know,
we're there for any of the locals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't feel I'm not one to just
stand back and wait I think it's you know
[SPEAKER_02]: up to us to make sure to provide any
resources that we have that would assist
[SPEAKER_01]: them In LA a lot of Angelenos are confused
as to what's a licensed store And what's
[SPEAKER_01]: not a licensed store?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a long history of unlicensed
operators there and there's very few
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed ones The Bureau of Cannabis
Control has a licensee lookup tool on its
[SPEAKER_01]: website Do you know how effective that is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it working our consumers going there to
disambiguate a licensed store from an
[SPEAKER_01]: unlicensed one?
[SPEAKER_01]: What more do you want to do to make sure
people know the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Considering that 80 90 percent of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their first time ever walking into a
Spencer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even know what to expect Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with our public awareness campaign,
we did change the name of our license
[SPEAKER_02]: shirt, so it's ca pot check calm and
Hopefully people like it's a lot easier
[SPEAKER_02]: than putting bcc.ca.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Correct and so I think We are gonna
make some more improvements to our
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing search because you know that we
don't we you can't search by DBA right now
[SPEAKER_02]: and so a lot of you don't know the legal
name or you may not even know the license
[SPEAKER_02]: number so but then again that QR code is
Also important so we're requiring
[SPEAKER_02]: Retailers they get a QR code when they're
issued their license They can post it out
[SPEAKER_02]: in front of the the store And so if you're
a consumer you can just take your camera
[SPEAKER_02]: take you know scan it and it'll tell you
all the information you need about that
[SPEAKER_02]: licensee the owners whether it's an active
license and so we're hoping that helps
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers because they can make that
decision prior to going into the store
[SPEAKER_02]: because You know you always have to post
your license inside the store,
[SPEAKER_02]: but who wants to go in there and say Women
say I feel super intimidated about this
[SPEAKER_01]: guy at the front desk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, where's your license like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, but I think more improvements to our
license search is to make it that much
[SPEAKER_02]: easier if you make things hard people
aren't gonna use it so I think it It's
[SPEAKER_01]: good what we have, but it can be better
Similar to the similarly to that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: this legacy of a lot of medical marijuana
products in the state and continued issues
[SPEAKER_01]: With counterfeit products at these
dispensaries you're rating them and
[SPEAKER_01]: picking them up and seeing the
counterfeits Is there anything on BCC's
[SPEAKER_01]: radar about battling the issue of
counterfeits empowering consumers to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to tell the difference I get a lot of
people who go I don't I don't know where
[SPEAKER_01]: this vape carts from and I I don't know
how to tell Right and it is even difficult
[SPEAKER_02]: for us to tell what the difference is
Consumers are it's hard to tell for us and
[SPEAKER_02]: even you know some of our you know
manufacturers I think we're looking At the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry itself, especially our
manufacturers and stuff how how how can we
[SPEAKER_02]: label things to to help?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not have so many of these things
counterfeited I mean and speaking of the
[SPEAKER_02]: QR code we already having to see we're
seeing labs where they're saying their
[SPEAKER_02]: certificate of analysis are being
Counterfeited right and so now we're even
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing labs voluntarily doing a QR code on
that Coa that eventually gets to that
[SPEAKER_02]: label so you can scan that label it goes
right to the Coa So I think the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: is pretty pretty savvy and I think We're
looking to work with the industry to help
[SPEAKER_02]: us with how do we deal with all these
counterfeit products?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's something that's that's
a big thing for this next year two more
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we'll be done Yeah, we did it
first one is how is there a better way to
[SPEAKER_01]: verify Bureau of Cannabis Control
employees when they do stat snap
[SPEAKER_01]: inspections some licensees have wondered
is this a real BCC guy or is this someone
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to Roll me because people have
gotten rolled in by individuals who are
[SPEAKER_02]: you know masquerading as officials now
Yeah, and we get people that that you know
[SPEAKER_02]: they have fake websites that say the
Bureau of Cannabis Control Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've seen that and we try to shut those
down, so there's all sorts of things so if
[SPEAKER_02]: our folks go out to a licensed inspection
they are wearing shirts that identify
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves they also have identification
that they are required to show you If
[SPEAKER_02]: asked and I have they have to have
business cards, so if there's ever
[SPEAKER_02]: something like something doesn't seem
right doesn't Feel right then we would say
[SPEAKER_02]: hey Who can we you can just call us to
verify it and we will be happy to take
[SPEAKER_02]: that call But our guys are very
professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're usually going to come out and at
least pairs and So ask them for their ID
[SPEAKER_02]: ask them for their business cards
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they I don't know where would the QR
code go to the wrist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no Lastly two-thirds of California
remains a band town so to speak But
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery can serve pretty much every
corner of the state at least next day some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these delivery services Is there
anything on the horizon for delivery in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2020?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys don't get involved with
the lawsuit that's ongoing Although I will
[SPEAKER_01]: say it doesn't seem like it holds much
legal water But is there any delivery
[SPEAKER_01]: needs we need to know about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the support on that so so when
it comes to delivery the That we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation that says if you're licensed by
the bureau and and you can for delivery
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can deliver any to anywhere in
California we are being Sued on that and I
[SPEAKER_02]: know David's gonna be upset with me,
but because there's a lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really not allowed to comment on
delivery So just logistics of delivery
[SPEAKER_01]: those delivery licenses are out those guys
are rolled In any delivery regs to to note
[SPEAKER_02]: today none to note today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if you have some suggestions No
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like I think people want to lessen
the regulation that add more That's the
[SPEAKER_01]: one suggestion from everyone, you know,
lastly the continuing theme I hear from
[SPEAKER_01]: people is how do we make license easier?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you help us in 2020 the industry
says they want me to ask you that so
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the last sort of question to you is
like are we gonna make licensing easier?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you help?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a great question,
I think Yes, we can make licensing easier
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there certain things that may always be
required that folks don't like yes because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's in the statute So some things is
beyond our control.
[SPEAKER_02]: We certainly being responsive making
things clearer Making sure we clear up
[SPEAKER_02]: confusion is always a top priority for us
and We we do want to help and I know that
[SPEAKER_02]: sound it sounds corny to say because
you're always like, yeah, right But truly
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't want this to be an arduous
process for you And I do feel like for a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of you it does seem that way Well,
it is that not seem it is that way and so
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we are like I told you we're
looking at ways on even our Ways that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can be more flexible as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the last couple years there there
was A tendency like we're just following
[SPEAKER_02]: everything to the tee and I think the the
greatest thing that we could do is provide
[SPEAKER_02]: more flexibility In the in especially when
we're seeing as businesses change in and
[SPEAKER_02]: so I think Providing allowing that would
be helpful over the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got a hard thankless job Thank
you for getting up every morning and doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it Thanks for joining us here at the
International Cannabis Business
[SPEAKER_01]: Conference.
