[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to let these three kind people
introduce themselves, so I'll start with
[SPEAKER_11]: Todd.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I'm Todd Bourne.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am with MacArthur Capital and now
currently the CEO at Alpen Group.
[SPEAKER_11]: So my background comes from 30 plus years
into private equity.
[SPEAKER_11]: Prior to entering the cannabis space in
private equity and venture capital,
[SPEAKER_11]: my firm has managed about $4 billion in
assets.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then about 10 years ago, we made a
shift into U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've deployed between five funds that I'm
involved with, about $220 million U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those have been about, let's call it 30
some odd companies, invested over five
[SPEAKER_11]: funds.
[SPEAKER_11]: We raised capital from $100,000 a person
to a million a person.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was a grind.
[SPEAKER_11]: $220 million in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_11]: space was a lot of work to gather those
assets.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will say we're very well known for a
transaction that we had where MacArthur
[SPEAKER_11]: put about $3.5 million into two companies
that we merged into form factory.
[SPEAKER_11]: We sold and had an exit with that company
in less than 12 months for $160 million.
[SPEAKER_11]: Subsequently, our investors quite happy
with those returns.
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the end, we have pushed all our
chips in now and are focusing on Europe,
[SPEAKER_11]: the growth of Europe, the opportunities
globally.
[SPEAKER_11]: Alpen Group, we consider ourselves an MCO,
a multi-country operator.
[SPEAKER_11]: Versus MSO, LP, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's my background.
[SPEAKER_09]: Joel?
[SPEAKER_09]: Joel Redelman.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I worked in, was the founding partner
of Redfield Group.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're an alternative investment fund.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always looked at emerging markets,
tech space, cannabis space, anything which
[SPEAKER_09]: was a little bit on the edge at the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're now really focused on Promethean
Biopharma, which is our cannabis play.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've really focused on drug
development, efficacy, and how we can
[SPEAKER_09]: deliver a better product and better access
to patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jetta Decarcer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the founder of New Frontier Data,
a leading data analytics and information
[SPEAKER_05]: collection firm in the United States,
covering the cannabis industry worldwide.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a founding member of C-Trust,
currently introducing the first investment
[SPEAKER_05]: credit rating and scoring and monitoring
solution, specific assessing exposure and
[SPEAKER_05]: overall risk in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also sit on the board of Oncarbon,
which is a company out of India that is
[SPEAKER_05]: doing research, looking to understand the
applications of carbonization of hemp for
[SPEAKER_05]: industrial application.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of why I asked the question I
asked earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my background is really in data
collection, analytics, and fintech,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I now apply to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you, y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to start with capital
has always been feast or famine in this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how can operators be more proactive
in trying to seek capital and provide
[SPEAKER_02]: investors with the knowledge that they
know so they can make investments into
[SPEAKER_02]: these companies?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll kick off with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish we at least had a famine.
[SPEAKER_11]: In capital right now, this is probably one
of the most difficult environments I've
[SPEAKER_11]: seen to raise capital for this industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: And and and thus forth.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why we've deployed a lot of our own
personal capital into what the project
[SPEAKER_11]: we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'm seeing, though, is is also let's
call it just from the fund level and the
[SPEAKER_11]: investor base level, the US and let's just
call it all North American investors have
[SPEAKER_11]: run for the hills.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just been a complete disaster what's
happened in the US and I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_11]: not bad companies in a bad environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm talking about good operators with a
lot of demand and and and tons of sales
[SPEAKER_11]: completely implode because of a lack of
banking, proper federal guidance,
[SPEAKER_11]: regulation, etc.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when it comes to capital now,
let me just be the investor versus an
[SPEAKER_11]: operator for a second as someone that's
probably vetted and undue diligence on 500
[SPEAKER_11]: companies, maybe more than that across all
of the sectors that that cannabis has to
[SPEAKER_11]: offer.
[SPEAKER_11]: I what I see right now happening here in
Europe is the actual right way to build an
[SPEAKER_11]: industry where capital markets can go into
it versus let's call it a gold rush
[SPEAKER_11]: mentality.
[SPEAKER_11]: The US and Canada was a complete gold rush
mentality.
[SPEAKER_11]: No realization of real valuations.
[SPEAKER_11]: All of that due diligence.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I remember the first deal I ever
looked at.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's call it from the capital space.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a shoe box full of receipts and I
thought I hit the gold mine for due
[SPEAKER_11]: diligence.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean now we really are putting together
a structure in a marketplace that can be
[SPEAKER_11]: global in a sense ex-US and ex-Canada of
how does really the market start to
[SPEAKER_11]: develop here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So capital is brutal out there but truly
the opportunity that we see for massive
[SPEAKER_11]: multiple ex really is here now versus what
happened in the US and North America.
[SPEAKER_11]: You would look at companies in the US and
valuations where you'd walk in the door
[SPEAKER_11]: and see a $250 million valuation
pre-revenue.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all gone.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the opportunity that we have in
this difficult market is where the real
[SPEAKER_11]: winners will happen, that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_09]: But is capital really being brutal or is
it just asking the questions which it
[SPEAKER_09]: should have asked in the first place?
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you raising money again and again
and again without delivering on what you
[SPEAKER_09]: said you'd deliver the first time?
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are you turning over a billion dollars
but you're not profitable?
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can't run a business sustainably
then of course capital is going to run
[SPEAKER_09]: away to an industry where businesses can
be run sustainably and Europe has an
[SPEAKER_09]: opportunity now to learn from the mistakes
from America and for people to build
[SPEAKER_09]: businesses which are sustainable.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like as an investor when you look at
things don't you say well what's this
[SPEAKER_09]: money going to get you to?
[SPEAKER_09]: When you talk to a founder and all they
say is to the next capital raise,
[SPEAKER_09]: well that's just not good enough,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Business owners need to understand that
they need sustainable businesses and
[SPEAKER_09]: that's what will keep the money flowing
and that's what will keep things
[SPEAKER_09]: consistent like that and money will come
back to cannabis but cannabis operators
[SPEAKER_09]: need to prove that they can run
businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gold rush, the green rush is over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just operate like a proper business.
[SPEAKER_05]: The industry is maturing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany is tightened up and I expect that
things will be transparent and
[SPEAKER_05]: sophisticated and reported and operated in
a proper business manner.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's spot on.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean if you really think about it that
whole gold rush mentality, green rush
[SPEAKER_11]: mentality, we might not be sitting here
today had that not happened in reality
[SPEAKER_11]: because really then it was all in a sense
illicit market and so forth but the
[SPEAKER_11]: problems that's continuing to go on is
really the economies that are built in
[SPEAKER_11]: place right now continue to fester for the
illicit market, continue to fill the
[SPEAKER_11]: coffers of really the cartels,
really versus the businesses and Joel what
[SPEAKER_11]: you said I think is spot on.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you operate businesses as a business,
forget cannabis, just as a business as a
[SPEAKER_11]: business as a private equity investor for
30 plus years, that's exactly what you
[SPEAKER_11]: have to do and so in reality all of that
gold rush and mentality and green rush
[SPEAKER_11]: that happened, we probably wouldn't be
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd probably just still be in the illicit
markets so in a sense we can think that
[SPEAKER_11]: but all the dumping of that capital and I
mean just irresponsible dumping of
[SPEAKER_11]: capital, you have to go into opportunities
now in an asset like mentality so when we
[SPEAKER_11]: look at opportunities, we look at those
opportunities, are they sustainable?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the path to profitability?
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the path to let's call it even
revenue to profitability?
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't you agree?
[SPEAKER_09]: And why isn't it profitable now?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jihadi, you were sort of going back to
regulation and that how can these
[SPEAKER_02]: companies benefit from smart regulation
and that lead to investors being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the industry that way?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're working on sort of what your
project is working on with SeaTrust but.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, as part of what SeaTrust is trying
to do, I don't know if I would say
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation but we're certainly trying to
introduce and improve on standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Standards by which we assess risk and
investment opportunity in sort of a more
[SPEAKER_05]: transparent, pontifiable manner in a more
sophisticated business like manner but if
[SPEAKER_05]: we take that up a level above beyond just
the due diligence and financial assessment
[SPEAKER_05]: of risk, how can regulations help?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean how much time do we have?
[SPEAKER_05]: The issue I think is not how much can they
help, the issue is how do we even get
[SPEAKER_05]: close to have an environment given that
the industry is a global industry whereby
[SPEAKER_05]: those regulations really do help to
continue to foster good business growth
[SPEAKER_05]: and international business growth in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really sure I have an answer to
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot of hopes and dreams though.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think when you look at it
holistically, you can really get lost in
[SPEAKER_09]: the argument between adult use,
recreational, medicinal and everything
[SPEAKER_09]: else whereas the question we really need
to be asking is do the patients or the
[SPEAKER_09]: users that need the product have access to
it and ultimately within the
[SPEAKER_09]: self-medicating market or the recreational
market, whatever you'd like to call them,
[SPEAKER_09]: they're really quasi-medical users.
[SPEAKER_09]: They are medical users and whether they're
not familiar with the term that they're a
[SPEAKER_09]: medical user and they call themselves a
recreational user, it's really by the by
[SPEAKER_09]: but the increasing medicalization within
markets is a path to getting access to the
[SPEAKER_09]: people that need it without running into
the pitfalls of the current regulatory
[SPEAKER_09]: environment with UN laws and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_11]: So a major difference and I will say the
fact of coming let's call it from the US
[SPEAKER_11]: markets and now being completely all in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Our fund and it makes no more investments
really into the US marketplace unless it's
[SPEAKER_11]: more of a global type of investment so we
see what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_11]: The real reality is optimistically the
dollars and cents are enormous.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not the issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: The issue that the companies are having
and I always go back to it's very easy to
[SPEAKER_11]: point the fingers and say oh well bad
operators, spending too much money,
[SPEAKER_11]: we're unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_11]: Way ahead, first mover, David,
you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_11]: First mover is not where you want it to be
especially in the markets and now if
[SPEAKER_11]: you're looking at what's happening here in
let's call it Europe but I really look at
[SPEAKER_11]: it more globally.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great Germany, Switzerland,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a global marketplace ex US because
the US market is really a disaster and you
[SPEAKER_11]: can't even ship across the state line let
alone a country line.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean the real reality is now you look
at the tremendous finance and financial
[SPEAKER_11]: opportunity is here how do you build it
and what I think is going right here is
[SPEAKER_11]: really the slowing down versus racing in
and all of a sudden you have a marketplace
[SPEAKER_11]: that's there that isn't ready for it and
then it gets overbuilt and then things get
[SPEAKER_11]: pulled back and then the taxation kicks in
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a slow methodical approach that's
happening here in Europe and I'm very very
[SPEAKER_11]: bullish on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you gotta go in very light and slow so
to say but if you do that the market will
[SPEAKER_11]: build itself.
[SPEAKER_11]: Market efficiency is 101 when it comes to
us in the financial world.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an efficient marketplace but with
that efficient marketplace we know that
[SPEAKER_11]: the clients are there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that the use is there whether it
be a medical one day recreational and it's
[SPEAKER_11]: one day recreational.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm tremendously bullish on it but
you're gonna see a lot of battle scars
[SPEAKER_11]: from companies that are just not ready and
prepared for the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis borders have always been
pretty sticky as far as what people expect
[SPEAKER_02]: and what do you think we can do to improve
that in the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it goes back to my previous point
about the medicalization of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: market and if you can create a framework
whereby the medical market can expand the
[SPEAKER_09]: cross border regulations there then
facilitated through pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_09]: agreements rather than through narcotics
agreements and that's a path that's easier
[SPEAKER_09]: at the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you say borders are sticky can you
elaborate on that because I'm thinking of
[SPEAKER_05]: how we use that term in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I mean obviously I mean I think it's
the fleet free flow of goods right doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: occur in the US for that I mean other than
the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right so you're talking about the legal
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Europe has a great opportunity to
actually have let's call it interstate
[SPEAKER_05]: trade that the United States hasn't been
able to do or take advantage of because
[SPEAKER_05]: the fragmented regulatory environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: However I don't know that Europe as a
whole has figured out what exactly it's
[SPEAKER_05]: all supposed to look like.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a region in terms of their overall role
and their expertise and how do they want
[SPEAKER_05]: to position in the market in terms of how
are they going to be that strength and
[SPEAKER_05]: that niche which is going to be needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then within that region how is each
nation that is looking to embrace and sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of move forward with illegal cannabis
industry also going to position and bring
[SPEAKER_05]: their own expertise talent and niche.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a bit more to do and as my colleague
said it's a good thing that it's been
[SPEAKER_05]: taken slow and deliberate and thoughtful
process is taking place because there's no
[SPEAKER_05]: there's no point in rushing and the US and
North America has taught us a lot of what
[SPEAKER_05]: not to do but not necessarily what to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still trying to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_11]: So to go to your border scenario I didn't
quite understand the question so that's
[SPEAKER_11]: why I passed and I got it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't usually pass on questions often
but no I think that the issue is the US
[SPEAKER_11]: market you just have to remember it's
federally illegal still.
[SPEAKER_11]: What happens state by state is kind of
almost by the way an accidental.
[SPEAKER_11]: Another reason why we believe in the MCO
approach multi-country operating type
[SPEAKER_11]: approaches you really have a scenario
without borders here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean you really don't.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean we don't know how that's ultimately
going to lay out because the laws are
[SPEAKER_11]: being written and if I think a lot of us
smart folks in the room can help
[SPEAKER_11]: contribute to how those laws are written.
[SPEAKER_11]: We shouldn't have let's call it a border
scenario.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know in addition to that really
banking is not an issue here.
[SPEAKER_11]: The big banks are not going to touch it
right now because they still do business
[SPEAKER_11]: with US banks that might frown on their
ability to bank cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you have a free banking scenario
you have a free capital scenario and you
[SPEAKER_11]: have the ability to move across borders
those laws will be ultimately laid out.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have the stigma and the issue of
stigma what's happening in the US.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in reality it's an open canvas now but
going back to what Giada says is it's
[SPEAKER_11]: being moved out very slowly and that's not
necessarily a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can all be impatient for let's call it
for returns on our investment.
[SPEAKER_11]: As an investor this is all about returns
on our investment.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean if you're an investor out there you
know that if you're someone raising
[SPEAKER_11]: capital you know you better know that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean isn't that what the EU was for in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So going back to that so what do you think
the most important factor in the future is
[SPEAKER_02]: for the sector globally if that's the
case?
[SPEAKER_11]: Giada you want to go?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought we were supposed to rehearse
these questions ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean I think that's a billion dollar
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the biggest thing that we can do
today on a global scale to help the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the first thing is to realize that
it is a global market and it is a global
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity and to start from that
framework.
[SPEAKER_05]: So whether you are operating locally or
you're an MSO operating interstate or
[SPEAKER_05]: you're in Europe and you're beginning to
think about how you're going to plant your
[SPEAKER_05]: flag in Germany but then at the same time
work in Switzerland you really need to
[SPEAKER_05]: think like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to realize that it's not just a
matter of where you are locally but that
[SPEAKER_05]: the opportunity and the challenges are
going to come from all over the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: More interestingly to me specifically and
actually recently wrote a little something
[SPEAKER_05]: that maybe words a little something about
it is that we are beginning to see the
[SPEAKER_05]: emergence of regional expertise across the
global industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Regions really are beginning to sort of
develop their own personality and profile
[SPEAKER_05]: as it pertains to what their role is in
the whole ecosystem of cannabis and so
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe would be valuable for all of us in
the industry to again think of our own
[SPEAKER_05]: talent and expertise and what can bring to
bear while being very cognizant of what's
[SPEAKER_05]: happening around us at a big micro level
on a global level.
[SPEAKER_05]: My potential two cents.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah and I mean it's important to create
it that we create an environment where the
[SPEAKER_09]: demand can be satisfied.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all know people want cannabis the
people are out there that want it but if
[SPEAKER_09]: we don't have an environment where it can
be delivered from the grower or the
[SPEAKER_09]: producer all the way down to the patient
and the person that wants it well then we
[SPEAKER_09]: can make as much cannabis as we want it's
just going to sit and get old in our
[SPEAKER_09]: warehouses and putting a system in place
where we can the cannabis can be delivered
[SPEAKER_09]: to the people that need it and drive that
demand is also is what's going to drive
[SPEAKER_09]: the sustainability of our businesses.
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with both of those those comments.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what I would add to that is this.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have always let's call it at the
MacArthur level at my private equity firm
[SPEAKER_11]: took the approach of to be very
collaborative and to not think that we
[SPEAKER_11]: could either run any one deal by ourselves
take the lead and just do it all by
[SPEAKER_11]: ourselves and then as we would then do our
due diligence on firms to make investments
[SPEAKER_11]: in who would be the most collaborative
very difficult to get in the US as you
[SPEAKER_11]: have that border issue but to me
personally what what can now tee up the
[SPEAKER_11]: best opportunity for the largest growth is
for this industry here to be a global
[SPEAKER_11]: industry to be very collaborative.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you know one level of expertise
may be coming out of Portugal another
[SPEAKER_11]: might be coming out of Switzerland another
might be coming out of Germany another
[SPEAKER_11]: might be coming out of Columbia South
Africa on and on how did how does this
[SPEAKER_11]: industry now collaborate because it is one
big huge industry the difference is is not
[SPEAKER_11]: just a pure pharma industry so even let's
call it medical can still have that
[SPEAKER_11]: approach of how does that ultimately
become a recreational or an adult use
[SPEAKER_11]: product etc.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the collaboration between
countries companies leaders within the
[SPEAKER_11]: industry will be how this really can be an
enormous industry and it has to be a
[SPEAKER_11]: profitable I would love to say this is
philanthropy it's it's not I mean there's
[SPEAKER_11]: philanthropy that can come from successful
companies where they can then make a
[SPEAKER_11]: contribution to making sure that it's you
know let's call it is available to
[SPEAKER_11]: everyone is available to people that need
etc.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if this is not a successful viable
industry there is nothing to distribute so
[SPEAKER_11]: at the end of the day that collaboration
that unified philosophy is what ultimately
[SPEAKER_11]: makes us a successful successful industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I think that's all I have on the
question side should we turn it over to
[SPEAKER_02]: the audience and see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rocky Petrullo One World Legends Columbia
my question is the title up here cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: sector to grow unbounded and I think Todd
just did a good job about talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: collaboration and you know working
together which means to me both ways
[SPEAKER_06]: earlier today we had a panel that was
saying it is what it is the government's
[SPEAKER_06]: only going to allow Germany to grow in
Germany well if we're going to collaborate
[SPEAKER_06]: and we're going to go both ways if Germany
is going to serve France or Sweden or
[SPEAKER_06]: where there's you know been a pathogen
that's killed most of the product in Italy
[SPEAKER_06]: is Germany going to work with Italy or is
Germany going to only grow for Germany and
[SPEAKER_06]: not collaborate and market and sell to
other countries so I think like you said
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a big global market which includes
you know importation from Colombia as we
[SPEAKER_06]: had a couple of people speak this morning
and I like your approach Todd so what do
[SPEAKER_06]: you think do you think that to grow
unbounded we need to open these borders
[SPEAKER_06]: you know versus America which we will get
there but the states had to move forward
[SPEAKER_06]: because the federal government was going
to you know drag their tail but now that
[SPEAKER_06]: there's 37 states in America the next step
is the federal laws are going to have to
[SPEAKER_06]: change and then we'll have interstate
commerce.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you're exactly right that guy knew
what he was talking about I think you're
[SPEAKER_11]: spot-on it's a global environment it's a
and yes if anyone's saying is it's all
[SPEAKER_11]: just going to be our way and not the other
way that will be the failure that happens
[SPEAKER_09]: all over again so I think but I think what
the guys were saying this morning what
[SPEAKER_09]: wasn't that we shouldn't collaborate and
we should work within our countries it was
[SPEAKER_09]: saying this is what the government's
offering us now let's take what we can get
[SPEAKER_09]: now and keep pushing for what we want
rather than saying it's not enough and
[SPEAKER_09]: getting nothing and those incremental
steps help the market grow and develop and
[SPEAKER_09]: build in every place to a point where
governments are willing to give more and
[SPEAKER_09]: they'll they see that the negative effects
of the changes in the regulations haven't
[SPEAKER_09]: brought but brought lots of car crashes
because people are driving stoned or
[SPEAKER_09]: something else once they see that the
regulations are working then they'll be
[SPEAKER_09]: open to more regulations and we're better
off taking what we're offered and saying
[SPEAKER_09]: it's not enough.
[SPEAKER_11]: Joel I agree with you I mean if you if you
think about that all you can do is work
[SPEAKER_11]: within the framework that you're allowed
to do it no one on stage is going to say
[SPEAKER_11]: we're going to be able to change really
that environment so I agree that you have
[SPEAKER_11]: to work within the framework what you have
that being said it's one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_11]: and Daniel mentioned it earlier this
morning as well as that's why we are in
[SPEAKER_11]: Switzerland you know I mean we we're going
to be collaborative with Columbia and
[SPEAKER_11]: markets like that using what we have in
place if you isolate yourself you're only
[SPEAKER_11]: going to have an isolated marketplace I
mean it is what it is yeah and we should
[SPEAKER_09]: we shouldn't stop lobbying just because
we've got a small step which we should all
[SPEAKER_10]: keep pushing right absolutely exactly
check check oh okay and we're over here
[SPEAKER_08]: afternoon thank you thank you Derek Bielen
METEC Pharma from Australia on the
[SPEAKER_08]: question what can we do for the global
industry to move forward one of the
[SPEAKER_08]: challenges I believe exists to pretty much
every single country is driving under the
[SPEAKER_08]: influence of THC at this moment in time we
don't have a quantitative test is that
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of test not relevant at that moment
to start to work as an industry finding a
[SPEAKER_08]: quantitative test rather than a
qualitative test so that people are not
[SPEAKER_08]: afraid of using the product and with the
risk of losing jail or losing their
[SPEAKER_10]: license driving license it is first of all
studies show that stoners are better
[SPEAKER_10]: drivers than regular people the old joke
is that lower correct well the old joke is
[SPEAKER_10]: that a drunk person will drive right
through the stop sign but the stoner will
[SPEAKER_09]: wait for the stop sign to turn green yeah
I think these strikes a deeper chord there
[SPEAKER_09]: which relates to the misdesign of cities
ever since the invention of the automobile
[SPEAKER_10]: here here everything is everything yeah
what can we do about that I mean
[SPEAKER_10]: Washington State has tried to have a
default driving under the influence law so
[SPEAKER_10]: if you have five nanograms in your
bloodstream they can try to charge you
[SPEAKER_10]: with driving under the influence but I
mean I have five nanograms in my
[SPEAKER_10]: bloodstream just when I wake up in the
morning so I mean is there yeah I think
[SPEAKER_10]: where it's like an education thing where
we have to just educate people that well
[SPEAKER_09]: it well it is but say like Australia is a
terrible example because it was only a
[SPEAKER_09]: month or two ago there was a fellow that
was pulled over and he was stoned and they
[SPEAKER_09]: police told him not to drive and he got
back in the car and then t-bone someone
[SPEAKER_09]: and killed five people and so it's it's
not just given THC a bad name in that
[SPEAKER_09]: situation but it's really changed the
public discourse was he just on THC or was
[SPEAKER_09]: he on other things as well I believe he
was on a number of other things yeah but
[SPEAKER_09]: but that's not what's published in the
headline THC is what's published in the
[SPEAKER_09]: headline and the if people aren't
responsible then they'll just ban
[SPEAKER_01]: everything you all were highlighting how
difficult the regulatory environment is in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States and Todd I think you
said for that reason that you don't invest
[SPEAKER_01]: any capital in in the US and anymore not
anymore and my question is do you see that
[SPEAKER_01]: changing in the near future and what I
mean is I'm from California for instance
[SPEAKER_01]: which you know arguably has the most
difficult regulatory environment of any
[SPEAKER_01]: place in the United States and by virtue
of that there a lot of those first movers
[SPEAKER_01]: as you were discussing are now distressed
and so there's a theory that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: second movers might come in and
consolidate that market as the regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: environment gets more favorable and
they'll want people like you right to be
[SPEAKER_11]: investing capital you just gave away my
secret you're spot-on I mean really the
[SPEAKER_11]: distressed assets that are coming in the
US and the consolidation of the industry
[SPEAKER_11]: and the players you're spot-on and and
when I say we're not investing in the US
[SPEAKER_11]: it's because I think there's still a lot
more of blood in the streets before it's
[SPEAKER_11]: time to go in there but again there are
great operators there so I mean California
[SPEAKER_11]: has some of the best operators in the
globe I'd hate to pay those taxes and the
[SPEAKER_11]: state taxes and all the press and in the
280 e and all that's that's going to
[SPEAKER_11]: change the opera there's going to be that
tipping point of when that opportunity is
[SPEAKER_11]: is their distress to then boom back so no
I think you're spot-on I agree with you if
[SPEAKER_05]: I may add to that it's true that the
regulatory environment a change or a shift
[SPEAKER_05]: for the better in the regulatory
environment would absolutely support
[SPEAKER_05]: struggling businesses but I think that
it's all at the end of the day it's all
[SPEAKER_05]: about increasing transparency and
visibility into the industry and the
[SPEAKER_05]: operator and the businesses it really
comes down to that so whether it is
[SPEAKER_05]: catalyzed by regulation or just better
operation by the businesses I mean we're
[SPEAKER_05]: in the business of distressed assets we
know we we realize that there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses out there that are struggling
and what we do is we come in and we do
[SPEAKER_05]: what a doctor does we give them a bill of
health we tell them here's your pain point
[SPEAKER_05]: oh and these are your symptoms but this is
the disease and this is what you need to
[SPEAKER_05]: do to get better and then if you get
better your medicine is gonna be more
[SPEAKER_05]: capital and then you're gonna survive I
mean so I think we I'm not saying the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation is not critical I mean I'm all
about you know let's have federal
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation and federal standard around
everything packaging dosing like
[SPEAKER_05]: transparency visibility but I think we
also need to take ownership and
[SPEAKER_05]: responsibility and accountability to how
we've been operating businesses in the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis industry as well and I think it's
time to raise the bar when they say the
[SPEAKER_10]: early bird gets the worm the second mouse
gets the cheese profound my question is
[SPEAKER_03]: primarily to the money allocates can you
hear me yeah you got me it's to the money
[SPEAKER_03]: allocators on the stage what psychologist
this is probably a you know quite a pipe
[SPEAKER_03]: dream for Europe at the moment but if
Europe really does this right and takes
[SPEAKER_03]: off in the right direction what's the
right psychology for operators with money
[SPEAKER_03]: allocators saying hey we want to pile in
now you know because you guys have seen
[SPEAKER_03]: that in the past what what do you want to
see from operators saying hey no that's
[SPEAKER_03]: too big we won't take your money because
that's a very difficult one as a CEO of a
[SPEAKER_03]: company say hey I don't want your money
I'm good where I'm at so just maybe some
[SPEAKER_11]: perspectives on that please yeah I'll hit
that super quick because I think that's
[SPEAKER_11]: that's the tipping point and the great
question I think all the people that kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of came in and with a rush to too much
capital too quick overbuilt the
[SPEAKER_11]: marketplace before there was even a
marketplace so as looking and again I mean
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm putting my own money my partners were
putting our own money into this company
[SPEAKER_11]: but at the end of the day very asset light
not over allocating to size to marketplace
[SPEAKER_11]: etc knowing who the client is today and
let's call it who it's going to be a year
[SPEAKER_11]: and maybe two years from now ten years
from now it's going to look completely
[SPEAKER_11]: different also phasing your way in I've
seen so many you know okay all we need to
[SPEAKER_11]: do is raise 20 million dollars and yeah
okay good luck you know what are the
[SPEAKER_11]: phases that you can go in do I need a
million here three million here in five
[SPEAKER_11]: and Joel not to the and I'm going back and
raising all the time but phasing in to
[SPEAKER_11]: that stage of profitability okay we've got
this we're now moving with it now phase
[SPEAKER_11]: two will kick in or phrase three will kick
in yeah and how many times have you seen a
[SPEAKER_09]: company so all we need five million
dollars to build out a facility so why
[SPEAKER_09]: have you not thought about using a
contract manufacturer have you not thought
[SPEAKER_09]: of someone else's facility that already
exists like why are we building another
[SPEAKER_09]: facility or we need a million dollars to
buy this machine so did you look did you
[SPEAKER_09]: look in the auctions to see if there's
anyone any if there's a liquidator selling
[SPEAKER_09]: one did you look for a secondhand one did
you look at least about leasing it did you
[SPEAKER_09]: look of there's all there's all these
things and if you if you focus on like
[SPEAKER_09]: Todd said asset light expense like keeping
your costs low then in lean times the
[SPEAKER_09]: business survives if the bit if you're
overloaded with costs then where when lean
[SPEAKER_09]: times come that's where that's when it
ends when it just gets out of control if I
[SPEAKER_05]: may add a very macro level sort of comment
we've we've spent the past six months
[SPEAKER_05]: interviewing investors lenders and
creditors to understand well I'm not a
[SPEAKER_05]: creditor investor or lender but we did
spend some time talking to them because we
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted to understand what is it that you
know that that turns you off when you look
[SPEAKER_05]: at you know an investment or you know
what's making you know what's about
[SPEAKER_05]: performing loan for you what was that
pinpoint what's the what is it what does
[SPEAKER_05]: it stem from and actually what we found
out was that it was a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: disappointment let's call it with
governance and management a lot of it like
[SPEAKER_05]: it all no matter what the symptom was that
it came back up to bad management and I
[SPEAKER_05]: know that sounds sort of like a doll but
there you have it that's what we literally
[SPEAKER_09]: did a survey and that was the outcome of
it yeah great one I see your founders like
[SPEAKER_09]: putting lots of photos of people in decks
decks so the investor think so they think
[SPEAKER_09]: the investor sees it oh it's we're a big
business we're gonna grow bigger we're
[SPEAKER_09]: doing everything else but the all
investors look at that and they say
[SPEAKER_09]: there's too much cost in this there you
have to be realistic about who you are
[SPEAKER_09]: realistic about where you're going
realistic about forecasts and realistic
[SPEAKER_09]: about how you're actually gonna make money
and that's not by getting a good valuation
[SPEAKER_09]: next round and selling some shares down
[SPEAKER_09]: sell it hi I think one of the biggest
mistakes we've made as an industry is and
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep reminding people that this is not
just an agricultural industry you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that is obviously the the source of where
it begins but you have to build a full
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain and I think there was a lot
of obviously over capitalization in big
[SPEAKER_00]: farms because it was just completely
driven by metrics which in the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: looked fantastic have you seen we
obviously know that's that's changed have
[SPEAKER_00]: you seen a shift in where money is being
spent to develop the supply chain has
[SPEAKER_00]: there been a shift in the culture of that
that deployment of capital so that's funny
[SPEAKER_11]: because it's almost instinctive and
intuitive that the capital comes in and
[SPEAKER_11]: goes in to the front end always first
because without that there's really no
[SPEAKER_11]: product however you're right the the back
end the last yard of the field let's call
[SPEAKER_11]: it the distribution cycle etc you know
that's usually where the the lease capital
[SPEAKER_11]: goes into and it's the most important part
of the chain and they're real I have not
[SPEAKER_11]: seen that change really here you know
everyone's banking on the fact that it
[SPEAKER_11]: really would be a pharma distribution
model it'll go into the pharmacies it it's
[SPEAKER_11]: a medical product so that distribution is
in place I'm not necessarily convinced
[SPEAKER_11]: that that's the scenario but but I agree
that's what what happens is it the capital
[SPEAKER_11]: seems to come in on the front end and it's
very very light on the back end I think
[SPEAKER_09]: we've seen some further investment in
technology and whether it's through
[SPEAKER_09]: delivery systems or engineered products
and things like that because it's a
[SPEAKER_09]: there's a culture thing for you within the
recreational market then people like
[SPEAKER_09]: people within that market really do like
flour but beyond that in a medical market
[SPEAKER_09]: doctors and patients are looking for
repeatability for consistency for those
[SPEAKER_09]: dosage limits things like that and the
techno technologies that can improve the
[SPEAKER_09]: API improve the onset improve the
pharmacokinetics we're seeing investment
[SPEAKER_09]: in that and we're seeing new products come
to the market which you could describe as
[SPEAKER_09]: third generation fourth generation fifth
generation and the these are products
[SPEAKER_09]: which have the ability to shape the
medical market of the future I full hardly
[SPEAKER_05]: second that not only that we've seen some
innovation of technology that has been
[SPEAKER_05]: tested in the cannabis industry and has
been applied outside of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry due to this driving interest
specifically exactly what you said to
[SPEAKER_05]: increase sort of repeatability to have
more transparency scalability so yes I
[SPEAKER_09]: would say I would totally agree with that
you know we've to we've developed a
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis tablet that we're running a
clinical trial within Australia at the
[SPEAKER_09]: moment which is a sublingual comes in a
bottle doctor says two tablets under the
[SPEAKER_09]: tongue and it's taken taking the guesswork
out of oils taken the measuring out taken
[SPEAKER_09]: the the unpredictability of your spoon out
of it and it's it's improved the onset
[SPEAKER_09]: improve the pharmacokinetics and we're
getting great feedback from patients and
[SPEAKER_04]: is that is that going to be the future of
cannabis you tell me so okay so I mean I
[SPEAKER_04]: am I heard you that you know there has
been of course and we I think we all agree
[SPEAKER_04]: that you know over over overspending let's
say in the cannabis in the US has been has
[SPEAKER_04]: been certainly an issue also in Canada a
lot of value has been burned however the
[SPEAKER_04]: let's say if we analyze maybe the last 20
30 years every new industry software IT
[SPEAKER_04]: now in artificial intelligence electrical
battery whatever so the reality is that
[SPEAKER_04]: the US is generating the leading companies
and in Europe is very good at you know
[SPEAKER_04]: protecting consumers you know and from a
regulatory point of view but in the end
[SPEAKER_04]: the US is always kind of dominating the
new industries thanks to these huge flow
[SPEAKER_04]: of capitals and and propension to
innovation disruptive innovation so do you
[SPEAKER_04]: see any reasons for which the cannabis
sector in Europe should be or a global
[SPEAKER_04]: level should be different industry as
compared to all the other new industry so
[SPEAKER_04]: why why do you expect the sector not to be
dominated by US companies in the next ten
[SPEAKER_10]: years if you've ever smoked amnesia haze
run in Spain you know why the United
[SPEAKER_09]: States won't dominate the entire industry
no sorry I think the farmer in the US is
[SPEAKER_09]: missed the opportunity of cannabis and
farmer in Europe has an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_09]: really generate some good quality research
into what works and what doesn't whereas
[SPEAKER_09]: in America they've just completely
forgotten about it they've glossed over it
[SPEAKER_09]: because you can just go to the shop and
buy what you want or move to another state
[SPEAKER_09]: and buy what you want if you want it and
it's it it's been left in the hands of the
[SPEAKER_09]: consumer and farmer just doesn't care over
there and Europe has an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_09]: really excel there and I don't know that
the US is going to catch up going back to
[SPEAKER_05]: the idea that we're beginning to see sort
of regional profiles and expertise in the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis industry arguably in other
industries as well but maybe more
[SPEAKER_05]: prominently in the cannabis industry
because it's like this controlled
[SPEAKER_05]: environment that we can all sort of really
like look at as it's happening very
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly I would say Europe has many
advantages I mean beyond you know the
[SPEAKER_05]: research and farming research being the
operative word there when you look at
[SPEAKER_05]: health and beauty and food and beverage
look at where Europe is stands in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer packaged goods and some of the
largest conglomerates come out of here you
[SPEAKER_05]: look at L'Oreal and all these these guys
that have really led the way and the US is
[SPEAKER_05]: barely touching so I think it's about
going back and thinking about what is the
[SPEAKER_05]: talent and expertise that already exists
and how does that get applied to the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis industry and then how does the
regional industry positions in this case
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe to compete at a global level with
other regions I mean it comes down to that
[SPEAKER_05]: so Europe has as much of an opportunity as
Latin America or Africa well maybe those
[SPEAKER_05]: are not great example but they could also
have an opportunity when it comes to
[SPEAKER_05]: low-cost farming where they could really
produce the lowest cost high quality
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation of hemp for instance I'm
giving an example it really is going back
[SPEAKER_05]: to what is your talent what is your
expertise how do you capitalize on it by
[SPEAKER_05]: sticking to it
[SPEAKER_07]: okay hi guys I'm Nikki from CSAO in China
so I have a question what has the cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: companies done in the last three years
that made most of the company lose money
[SPEAKER_07]: sustainably especially the public
companies in North America like canopy
[SPEAKER_07]: till right they this the share has dropped
like a shit so is there anything that is
[SPEAKER_07]: there any lessons that European market
actually can learn from it absolutely
[SPEAKER_11]: that's I mean that's exactly why we pushed
all our chips here in in Europe and the
[SPEAKER_11]: MCO model what happened in the US and I'll
just I'll speak to that because I've
[SPEAKER_11]: invested more in the US than in Canadian
companies but having a government put
[SPEAKER_11]: pressure having the wrong scheduling on
this drug by overtaxing at a state level
[SPEAKER_11]: not allowing access to proper banking I
mean there's no there's no reason why
[SPEAKER_11]: Goldman Sachs isn't able to go make
investments in the cannabis space but it's
[SPEAKER_11]: because of our backwards laws that we have
here if Europe and really ultimately the
[SPEAKER_11]: globe this takes the right steps now and
takes the right actions and when when I
[SPEAKER_11]: hear things that slow down here I know it
frustrates everybody oh you know this is
[SPEAKER_11]: this set us back no it really makes us
from keeps us from making mistakes right
[SPEAKER_11]: now the mistakes that we've learned in the
US the implosion of let's call it the
[SPEAKER_11]: stocks in Canada you got to have a company
that has earnings you know you in any boom
[SPEAKER_11]: of a marketplace tech stocks telecom
stocks biomed stocks whatever those can
[SPEAKER_11]: only ride on a boom for so long eventually
you have to have the earnings behind that
[SPEAKER_11]: that's why I believe the opportunity is
here I believe the opportunity is here now
[SPEAKER_11]: and I believe that the opportunity for
investments and I I mean we partnered with
[SPEAKER_11]: a pharma company you know I think to jump
on that as well of what can happen now
[SPEAKER_11]: when you have where pharma companies can
really be in business with you versus
[SPEAKER_11]: let's call it what happens in the US where
only a handful of monopolies get that
[SPEAKER_11]: opportunity I think the sky's the limit
here so again when I'm optimistic I'm not
[SPEAKER_11]: just a little optimistic I'm all-in
optimistic so I think you have a great
[SPEAKER_11]: question we've learned everything that can
go wrong there you name it it's gone wrong
[SPEAKER_11]: now we have an opportunity really to to
monopolize through those thoughts and now
[SPEAKER_10]: capitalize properly fantastic thank you so
much you
