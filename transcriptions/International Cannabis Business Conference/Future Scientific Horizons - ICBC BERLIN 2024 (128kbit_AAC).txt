[SPEAKER_05]: to discuss future scientific horizons.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here to lead us in this panel,
the one and only COO of the Tallman Group,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's chief organizational officer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dang.
[SPEAKER_05]: So prepared.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't just want to call you the coo.
[SPEAKER_05]: The coo.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's coo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's the coo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Justin Tambay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Engaio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate that very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's everybody doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a good day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feeling well?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear a little noise, ICBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is going to be a great way to
wrap up the day with a really interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's something that's prominent
for many people here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking about where are the horizons of
research?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are they taking us?
[SPEAKER_02]: The panel that we have here of subject
matter experts have a lot of experience to
[SPEAKER_02]: share.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be, of course, a bit of
emphasis on the pharmaceutical industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: as that's the nature of the panel
discussion here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will be venturing a little bit
beyond just the narrow scope of the
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So briefly, we have in order Francesco
Bafuno and Professor Christian Ulitz,
[SPEAKER_02]: Athanasia Cunley, and Professor Bojidar
Radicic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And forgive me if I.
[SPEAKER_04]: Athanasia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Athanasia, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd like to just give each of the
panelists a brief moment to introduce
[SPEAKER_02]: yourselves, what your background is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll start to dive into the
subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to start us off, Francesco?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Francesco here from Italy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I work globally in North America.
[SPEAKER_04]: And around Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, we're doing a lot of
research in the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of developments in the
last years going on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we focus basically more on the patient
perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a completely different model
than the pharmaceutical standard one on
[SPEAKER_04]: the standardized product just for the
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be great to talk about
this with my colleagues here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christian?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, everyone, in the evening here and
the afternoon last session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christian Ulitz, I'm professor at Humboldt
University here in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not working in the medical field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working as a plant ecophysiologist in
agriculture horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main focus is here on the production
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have established a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working since six years,
beginning with CBD plants, now with the
[SPEAKER_00]: only university in Germany with a THC
license for medical cannabis on the
[SPEAKER_00]: production part mainly, including tissue
culture lab, including the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are having partners established
with the German Center for Medical Health,
[SPEAKER_00]: with German Center for Psychic Health,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are offering lots of partnerships to
the industry to work with the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the last years, we had two cannabis
research class.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis entered already teaching at
the university level, funded, co-funded by
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry, thanks to Aurora and
Demekan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so focusing really on this product,
which we are rediscovering in
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Christian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Athanasia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Athanasia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm originally from Greece, but I've been
living in the north.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is a lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually not as sunny.
[SPEAKER_01]: But apart from my personal suffering,
I work for DSM Firminish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a company with a history of 100
years, a leader in vitamins and
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm responsible for our pharma
cannabinoid sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: So through the high quality pharmaceutical
ingredients, innovation capabilities,
[SPEAKER_01]: and consistent supply chain that we can
offer we are hoping to be the partner for
[SPEAKER_01]: your pharmaceutical development,
big or small, as many of our customers can
[SPEAKER_01]: attest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Bozo?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Bozo Radicic, coming from Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started on the other side as an activist
20 or more years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But soon we realized that we can move
forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can move the cannabis to the medical
use just with the education and with the
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we organized a research institute in
Slovenia, and we started to organize
[SPEAKER_03]: education for doctors and nurses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if we want to bring the cannabis
into practice, I think we need
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledgeable professionals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we start to teach them today,
we will have first professionals like in
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 years from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are in this very interesting and
unique time in the history of the world
[SPEAKER_02]: and here in Europe in that we have been
for the last 80 plus years in a period of
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition on a plant with an incredible
amount of potential to impact human health
[SPEAKER_02]: and a variety of other uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Research has been constrained to very,
very limited narrow focuses and in many
[SPEAKER_02]: ways has been underfunded and not carried
out nearly as robustly as the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: deserves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're coming out of the backside of
that now, emerging from what has been
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe a bit of folk medicine and cottage
industry into an opportunity to sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: come back up and address this at the level
of professional industry that it merits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I'd like to do is ask my
panelists what you feel is perhaps one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the most needed or prioritized areas of
cannabis research that you feel should be
[SPEAKER_02]: emphasized moving forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll start with you, Francesco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, in this last year,
we saw a lot of research going on on the
[SPEAKER_04]: two main compounds produced from the
cannabis plant, like obviously CBD and
[SPEAKER_04]: THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw a boom in the market as well on
products that were not properly medical,
[SPEAKER_04]: but used from people as well for medical
purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the future, instead, the cannabis
plant is unique in these aspects because
[SPEAKER_04]: it produces a lot of compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've studied very, very few of them until
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be a lot of research done
on minor cannabinoids for sure in the
[SPEAKER_04]: future, and that's going to be a lot of
new cannabinoids that are going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: discovered.
[SPEAKER_04]: On top, we need to address as well that
the cannabis plant and the compounds,
[SPEAKER_04]: the secondary metabolites in general,
we are talking about flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're talking about terpenes, but these
compounds are alive even when you cut the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a fermentation process going on
there after curing for months.
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, the compound changes over
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a base of, we can say,
fermentation, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a matter of terpenes, for example,
there's terpenes that are unique to the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis plant, and there are terpenes
that are unique after the fermentation and
[SPEAKER_04]: exist only in the cannabis plant,
for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a topic super interesting,
and we've been researching in Canada this
[SPEAKER_04]: for a little while.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, for example, for the future,
this is going to be super interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: venue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, like I said earlier on,
we have a different model.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we try to actually bring to the market
right away our research.
[SPEAKER_04]: With our partners, we try to monetize,
to bring the research further,
[SPEAKER_04]: because investments in research on these
topics are really not enough, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because funds, hedge funds, capital is
looking for quick profit and research for
[SPEAKER_04]: medical purposes is for the benefit of the
society, of the well-being of the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a total different approach,
a totally different philosophy than the
[SPEAKER_04]: capital approach of the finance and the
business, let's say.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're looking about healthcare and
we're looking about business.
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to bring the things together.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why our approach is trying to
monetize.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's trying to self-sustain itself over
time to expand the research in order to
[SPEAKER_04]: find new compounds, find new applications
for patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, the well-being of the
society at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Business as usual isn't necessarily a
model that we can adopt moving forward to
[SPEAKER_02]: realize all the potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about Athanasia, you work directly
inside the pharmaceutical industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you have more of an insider's view.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Francesco talks about the minor
cannabinoids or these other elements that
[SPEAKER_02]: have potential medical application and
value, what's the interest from within the
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical industry in researching and
maybe developing products based on those
[SPEAKER_02]: other constituents and compounds that
you're aware of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we do, I do have the joy and the
pleasure to actually have these
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations with pharmaceutical
companies day in, day out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a very interesting shift in
mindset that's happening right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be a question for big pharma
like, oh, this is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we know what is actually working
and what is not?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is very interesting to note,
I'd say in terms of what the research is
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So minors and combinations, but when we
think combinations is our API in
[SPEAKER_01]: combination with an existing medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an existing approved treatment that
could help amplify its impact,
[SPEAKER_01]: that could also help reduce side effects
and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, the patient-centric formats.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should all be aware that with the
knowledge and the technology that was
[SPEAKER_01]: available in the time, being able to
dissolve CBD in oil was the best possible
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's no longer the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have solutions that are particularly
applicable for patient convenience and
[SPEAKER_01]: patient compliance and reducing
variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these could be solid formats like an
orally disperseable tablet, like a
[SPEAKER_01]: chewable tablet, like topicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And patients are asking for that and we
should be answering that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we at DSM for Menish are actually
developing some of these formulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we also see great applications from
other parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a last area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I talk to pharma companies,
what do they ask for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what we all need to be
aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two elements that will always
come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: IP and pharma standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So IP, I think, is a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of good work around
patents across our industry, but pharma
[SPEAKER_01]: standards is something we need to double
down on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you're starting a development
of a new pharmaceutical product and short
[SPEAKER_01]: on cash, there's often a desire to limit
costs and that's understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But making discounts on the wrong things
is going to make your product an
[SPEAKER_01]: unattractive investment down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's even more going to put patients
at risk with just not something that
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So starting right from the right
ingredient, with the right standards,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the right certifications,
all the way down to not just GMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we should be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a bit of a confusion on what GMP
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being manufactured in a GMP facility is a
prerequisite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not sufficient by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a set of quality standards and
pharma prerequisites and purity data and
[SPEAKER_01]: stability data and how you design your
clinical trial that you need to think in
[SPEAKER_01]: advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what is the risk that you find
yourself at the end of the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: three years and you've made a discount
that actually now means nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: invest in your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who's losing?
[SPEAKER_01]: People who invested in you, your time,
your money, the patient who's never going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we definitely need to have a
wider understanding on how we approach
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly companies that are looking
to place their products in the traditional
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical model would be wise to know
beforehand exactly what they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have to do in order to have a better
chance of success.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moshe, you've worked with a number of
different, you've worked from your medical
[SPEAKER_02]: clinic over the years providing cannabis
in different forms of delivery to
[SPEAKER_02]: patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: But outside of the pharmaceutical model,
do you believe that there's a place for
[SPEAKER_02]: research and development in the kind of,
the other sort of medical applications
[SPEAKER_02]: that don't follow the strict sort of
pharmaceutical model and standards?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what would that look like for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that as Atanasio said,
there must come to change of the mindset
[SPEAKER_03]: of pharma industry because cannabis works
completely on different way than the
[SPEAKER_03]: certain remedies that allow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're on the market now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we were following patients also,
not just as a patient, but also we
[SPEAKER_03]: followed what they used, how they used,
all the possible applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: So through the year, we have a lot of,
let's say, experience and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that on the research,
that is providing by pharma industry now,
[SPEAKER_03]: the pharma is, I think, on the complete
wrong way because they want to,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's, this is the pharma mindset.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they want to develop drug which
will help for a certain condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we should adjust the dosage
and everything to human endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: system so we can stimulate it on the best
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not for the certain disease, but for the
so-called personal medicine, personalized
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, very different approaches,
but with similar kinds of goals in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of outcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I will add as well that obviously
the Taylor made, that's why it's very
[SPEAKER_04]: different than the pharmaceutical,
like standardized product, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot think about cannabis and
application with cannabis plant itself and
[SPEAKER_04]: its extracts as any other pharmaceutical
existing in the industry, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is, if you take cannabinoid,
okay, then you synthesize it, so you make
[SPEAKER_04]: it proprietary technology, you patent it
because it's no longer nature,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you find something that is
working on that molecule, which is no
[SPEAKER_04]: longer nature, then you can have a
standardized product, but it's not sure
[SPEAKER_04]: that it will work on each and every one of
us, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, exactly the approach of somebody
that is being close to the patients can
[SPEAKER_04]: actually reveal how the pharmaceutical
developments on the cannabis needs to be
[SPEAKER_04]: made, which is the Taylor made medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can give the pharmacists not a
prepared drug, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is why the regulation is like
this at the end of the day, and I would
[SPEAKER_04]: like the regulation on the medical
cannabis to stick like this and just move
[SPEAKER_04]: on, on the research side, because
pharmacists are so important at this
[SPEAKER_04]: point, because, and obviously doctors,
because we need to adjust the dosage as
[SPEAKER_04]: well to each and every one of us,
the endocannabis cannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_04]: as well the receptors, because each and
every one of us has a different level of
[SPEAKER_04]: reaction to the cannabinoids, and as well
the endocannabinoids similar that are
[SPEAKER_04]: produced by our own body, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's three levels where you need to
look when you are prescribing or when are
[SPEAKER_04]: you preparing a formulation for a patient
in the cannabis system.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's space, you know, space.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's so difficult to educate
physicians, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously another thing is that the
endocannabinoid system interacts with
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty much every disease that we can
have, all right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So this means that can be mimicked.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can actually interact with our
endocannabinoid system with compounds that
[SPEAKER_04]: are similar to cannabinoids, and as well
terpenes, and as well flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_04]: and as well, you know, protein and amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very, very, you know, tailor-made.
[SPEAKER_04]: A person likes strawberry, another lemon.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot, that's why, for example,
France is moving on the right way on the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis medicine, because the flowers
are, it's not possible to standardize a
[SPEAKER_04]: flower, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are allowing on the medical side
just the oils, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's easier to get there on the
oils because the flowers are so
[SPEAKER_04]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just said, okay, let's get rid of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's stop there for just a moment,
because that's an interesting place to
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe bring in Christian here into the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a real emphasis whether it's in
the pharmaceutical model or whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: in sort of the extant medical model to
having a standardized or consistent
[SPEAKER_02]: product, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet the cannabis by its nature is this
very, it's a plant with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: plasticity expressed very differently
depending on the epigenetic conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there something from a cultivator's
point of view that you think in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: research could help create a more
consistent standardized product that would
[SPEAKER_02]: be of use in both the pharmaceutical and
the more traditional medical model?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Justin, I mean, this is what is
demanded even by the regulatory framework
[SPEAKER_00]: we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are going into the medical purpose,
of course, we have to go into controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: More control we have, you know,
and more of your focusing on one genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: More we can calculate and predict what the
outcome will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we are talking about a
bioproduct, you know, and the bioproduct
[SPEAKER_00]: is still so diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tailor-made medicine is so much in the
future when it comes to bioproducts where
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the components affect each other,
as you pointed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the entourage effect is something
which we don't understand yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have just bits and pieces of our
understanding here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I think that from our growers'
perspective, we are working on and we are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting much better understanding now on
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of companies now who
can produce cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're all struggling, you know,
even within the production system on
[SPEAKER_00]: certain issues which will affect the
secondary metabolite composition as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as the amount of secondary metabolites
which are bioactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see both ways in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the one is, of course,
going stronger into the medical part where
[SPEAKER_00]: we really try to understand in the
beginning individual components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we start combining components,
you know, to understand what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical effect here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have seen this in other products
which have not been, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so much stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I look into salicylates,
it's the same effect here until we came up
[SPEAKER_00]: to a product like aspirin, you know,
but still there is a market in addition to
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will be something which we will
have also in the future here with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick reaction to this because what
I really like about this panel,
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of reflects the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have completely different parts and
completely different groups and people
[SPEAKER_01]: with different interests, which is great
because a polyphony of interest means a
[SPEAKER_01]: polyphony of research, you know,
avenues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I honestly do believe there is space
for very different segments and very
[SPEAKER_01]: different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So long as we are clear what is the need
we are trying to meet here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a regulated recreational market
works fantastically well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is space for that type of product in
that type of market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we are seeing more and more of the
cosmetics, food supplements.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is space for that market for people
who want to have a day to day functional
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is space for the medical cannabis
market as it is evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is the pharmaceutical
development, which is meant to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: product that has been tested and proven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know it works for the vast majority
of patients with a specific disease and
[SPEAKER_01]: can be prescribed based on evidence,
knowledge and the confidence of the
[SPEAKER_01]: physician.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so where I am seeing that what my
experience has been in this space is we
[SPEAKER_01]: are mixing things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is not helping us because it
doesn't help us explain to the end
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer or the patient what kind of need
we are meeting with our product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't be everything to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we try to do that in the end,
we will end up with more confusion and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that comes from the cannabis
plant is going to be bundled under I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand kind of area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I would like to caution
us to be able to speak to what is the need
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to meet and what is the pathway we
want to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we chose the pharmaceutical pathway
because we have a lot of experience in
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are convinced that once something
is proven, it can be reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can actually be easy to access for a
number of patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean it is the only way that
it means that so long as we all understand
[SPEAKER_01]: and probably what we should be investing
in is a library of knowledge, a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: structured, organized way of
understanding, documenting and proving the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit of different parts of the plant
and different uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that term a library of knowledge
and something that has been unfortunately
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit impoverished over these
decades of prohibition because we haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: been able to effectively address the
research need to be done and create a
[SPEAKER_02]: language that contextualizes everything in
sort of the path or lane that segment that
[SPEAKER_02]: it would be appropriately placed in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we look at the landscape of
cannabis research moving forward,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious what you all see as obstacles
that we'll need to overcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard people speak to the stigma of
working with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're speaking to not being able to
differentiate the segments and the
[SPEAKER_02]: different approaches in the context of
application.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I saw you nod your head first,
Christian.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you a first shot at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm going to get everybody here on
the panel a shot at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the obstacles that you feel like
we need to overcome and briefly how might
[SPEAKER_02]: we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, talking about obstacles,
it's always the money first, but this is
[SPEAKER_00]: not what I want to mention here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, for me, the stigma is really one of
the biggest obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have lots of colleagues who are working
with cannabis and research and they do not
[SPEAKER_00]: publish papers and they don't talk about
it because still we are coming from a
[SPEAKER_00]: different generation and it's still in the
mindset of many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We opened a cannabis lab now at the
university, but when my president comes,
[SPEAKER_00]: she doesn't want to get a picture because
she's a politician, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't want to become involved in
this too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's more curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working now in cannabis at the
university.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what the politics in Germany
bring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is something which we have to
really overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is, in the moment,
research is very much within the
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Research and development is within
companies and they all have, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: their own interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They protect their research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not willing to share among,
but what we need is not only a database of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need also a solid ground for getting
rid of all of those stigmatization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is something where the public
needs to jump in, in open markets and
[SPEAKER_00]: markets which are getting now,
like in Germany, more open and start
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting, and this is the money part,
supporting public research so that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: all kind of a minimal baseline and then
the rest can be differentiated between
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Athanasia, is there something that you'd
like to add on or we could go to Bojidar?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I always have something to add.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you might.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I already talked about the
patient-centric formats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patient acceptance will increase the
prescription, will increase the use,
[SPEAKER_01]: and will help reduce stigma, among other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing that, from a formulation
perspective, is important to look at is
[SPEAKER_01]: the bioavailability challenge with many of
these cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know CBD, many other cannabinoids,
have very low bioavailability,
[SPEAKER_01]: very low absorption because of first-pass
metabolism and incomplete absorption in
[SPEAKER_01]: the gastric route.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are we doing about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we actually make sure that the
patient takes enough of the medicine that
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be good for them, but not more
than what they need and that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: effective?
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we at DSM for Menish have been
working on that and are aiming to have,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're putting actually a clinical trial
together this summer to test an improved
[SPEAKER_01]: bioavailability formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need more of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone thinking together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there are lots of technologies
out there that have that aspiration
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, something that's not an
obstacle internally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think bioavailability is an internal
obstacle, intrinsic to our work.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that I think is extrinsic is
regulation legislation being built without
[SPEAKER_01]: full understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think our duty and our opportunity is
to help inform legislation based on the
[SPEAKER_01]: research that we do, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Help the legislator who's never met a
cannabinoid medicine before make informed
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a really good example.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many, but there's one that sticks
to mine and me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from the Lombard Institute in
Australia where there was a very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: question from the regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the workers in the mining and
transportation industry in Australia,
[SPEAKER_01]: can they use medical cannabis and come to
work the next day?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did an observational study and
they proven there is no problem with
[SPEAKER_01]: memory, with driving, with anything they
could measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually the regulation came out and
said, okay, that is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical cannabis can be used in this
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we can do a lot more as well
to help invest, but that shouldn't be only
[SPEAKER_01]: on us, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be only on the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Public private partnerships, shared costs,
and a shared understanding of if we are
[SPEAKER_01]: able to prove that this medicine works and
actually helps relieve pain, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: massive loss of quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we get access to as many patients
as possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to speak about either the
obstacles that you foresee to research or
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps the need to educate decision
makers and stakeholders in the industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So bad legislation is always a big
obstacles for any researcher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since very recent ago, everything
about cannabis was illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think with the change of the
legislation in Germany and other
[SPEAKER_03]: countries, this stigma will very quick
disappeared and cannabis will come to the
[SPEAKER_03]: mainstream research because people
demanded, you know, patients are very
[SPEAKER_03]: informed about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's on the professionals side to
bring this to life as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Francesca, do you think that there's a way
that the regulators and the decision
[SPEAKER_02]: makers can be more informed and more
responsive to a patient centric approach
[SPEAKER_02]: to something that considers, you know,
really the efficacy in an area that's
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of their experience, outside of
their wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how would you like to see us approach
that as an industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we saw the European Union last year
made that make a huge step forward on
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis research because they actually
the European Union said, OK, let's invest
[SPEAKER_04]: in medical cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're giving funds for the medical
cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_04]: As well, I had the privilege to work back
in 2020 in an ISO project that was to
[SPEAKER_04]: create a standard for a recreational
market in Europe.
OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, I see that long story short,
we developed the standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an existing standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Few people knows this.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an existing standard ISO.
[SPEAKER_04]: ISO stands for International Standard
Organization in Geneva.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, hopefully everybody knows about
this because it's every day in our lives
[SPEAKER_04]: constantly this kind of standards and
regulations.
OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we basically developed a standard for a
European recreational market.
[SPEAKER_04]: How needs to be, you know, the settings
and developed, but still is an
[SPEAKER_04]: approachable as to bring everybody
together is not applicable because simply
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone has a different approach on each
and every country.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I see the legislators at this point
moving forward toward cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK?
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried on the recreation of doesn't
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they moved on the medical side and it's
working a lot because anyways,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've seen a lot of projects going on as
well funded from, you know, public
[SPEAKER_04]: entities about the about cannabis
research.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm very positive about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, like I said, the
institution is there, but the private
[SPEAKER_04]: sector not much simply because of the
financial issues, the return on investment
[SPEAKER_04]: so fast they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: They think like cannabis says,
cryptos and, you know, so this sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: stigma on the financial industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top, obviously, there's the problem
of some patients that really needs
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I met a lot worldwide, patients that
really need cannabis, but they are afraid
[SPEAKER_04]: of using it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They never used it because of the
prohibition and everything, obviously was
[SPEAKER_04]: not accessible.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now they actually, have a problem
because I cannot solve it because they're
[SPEAKER_04]: using palliative medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they use cannabis, it will be much
better for them because there's no or very
[SPEAKER_04]: little side effects compared to the
traditional medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe that we can move forward
fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that we can move forward fast if
the finance sector is going to invest in
[SPEAKER_04]: research in pharmaceutical and we have the
backup of the institution.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can do a lot of great work over here
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as well, I saw companies in Canada
getting millions for research and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: exciting, you know, on the medical
aspects, it's very, very exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that we can get to that point as
well over here in Europe, cooperating with
[SPEAKER_04]: institutions like universities,
private sector, companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is going to be the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can see here from the discussion
today that it's a complex, sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: convoluted landscape as we emerge out of
the prohibition era and the different
[SPEAKER_02]: interests that have influence on where
cannabis research is being directed and to
[SPEAKER_02]: what end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes it feels like a lot to try
and overcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, there's a lot to be
excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we are finding now that there is
going to be new models of public and
[SPEAKER_02]: private partnership that will come
together to invest into research that's
[SPEAKER_02]: needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the spirit of kind of also
looking at what's possible and what's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's what's exciting and what
creates optimism in the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to give each of you guys a chance
to speak to just something in the world of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid or cannabis research that
you're aware of now that's kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting edge and an exciting thing that
really gets you fired up and that you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: like to share with our audience here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll start with you down there,
Bojidar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is the most actually research
plant on the planet with 150,000 studies
[SPEAKER_03]: about it, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we need more, let's say,
not that high science, but something that
[SPEAKER_03]: it would bring cannabis more towards
doctors, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need not high science, but they need
the protocols, they need applications,
[SPEAKER_03]: methods, they need right dosages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what is actually missing
because until we don't have this,
[SPEAKER_03]: the doctors, I don't know, this is my
opinion from Slovenian aspect,
[SPEAKER_03]: it will not come to the general use among
the medical, in the medical system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So education of healthcare professionals
and in that sort of field there,
[SPEAKER_02]: development of that is a piece that you
see in the support and extension of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis research that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and I should also, I think that the
cannabidiology should be part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: curriculum in the medical faculties and
all other professional schools because
[SPEAKER_03]: without the educated professionals,
it will never be a part of the mainstream
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you, Athanasio?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you see out on the horizons of
cannabis research that you find exciting
[SPEAKER_02]: or inspiring?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So immediately, I'm very, very excited
about the premium formulated CBD powder
[SPEAKER_01]: we're bringing to the market because we
are talking enhanced bioavailability,
[SPEAKER_01]: solid formats, patient-centric formats,
and increased API loading.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking enabling research on a
different level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But okay, that is for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the longer timeframe, I really am
encouraged and hopeful to see that some
[SPEAKER_01]: countries are enabling regulation that is
helping the traditional way we've had to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn in this industry on how the plant
works from observational data,
[SPEAKER_01]: from real-world evidence, from case
studies, which is not something that
[SPEAKER_01]: normally pharma would accept as part of
the way in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is becoming part of informing how we
will do pharmaceutical development and how
[SPEAKER_01]: it will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Practical example, what's happening in
Brazil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can bring a product, a cannabinoid
product to the market you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstrate quality and safety and you
have five years to do a clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens in those five years?
[SPEAKER_01]: The physicians learn which indication it
works best, which patient population it
[SPEAKER_01]: works best.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legislator is learning which of these
products are actually best to use and
[SPEAKER_01]: which ones are not performing to the
promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five years down the line, you have a
well-designed clinical trial that can show
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit in the right patient population
and you have full market access.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not something we've been used to
in the pharmaceutical sector and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a wonderful step forward that some
big countries and big markets are working
[SPEAKER_01]: on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still the formulated CBD powder is more
exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The change of the mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shameless plugs are welcomed.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Christian, what about you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you see the horizons of cannabis
research in the fields that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in that are exciting and
inspiring for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are two different approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one is and I've heard today in
different panels that we are all going
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to medical cannabis under
really controlled conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we are going now under
semi-controlled conditions and we are
[SPEAKER_00]: having new technologies using lots of
sensors to manipulate the plant during the
[SPEAKER_00]: production process so that we really can
forecast what the quality is, what the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: content is and we are able to find the
right algorithms during our production
[SPEAKER_00]: system that we can create a plant,
model a plant which is then maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: first step to tailor personalized medicine
when it comes to a complete by a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is really something which
I'm looking forward and we are learning a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot in the last years even.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second part is we are combining now
systems in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything should be more sustainable
because agriculture, horticulture is of
[SPEAKER_00]: course a lot of under pressure when it
comes to climate change and all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sustainability plays a major role
and combined farming systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we use not only produce a plant
for one product, but we use a full plant
[SPEAKER_00]: where we combine it to save energy and so
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something which is really
inspiring and we are running a project
[SPEAKER_00]: where we combine different production
systems and cannabis is only one part of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where we work for the medical industry but
we fully use the plant for everything else
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to feed as a fiber and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of different products which are
coming here and I think this is really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting to see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people are interested in
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a great reminder that there's
often times such a hyper focus on the
[SPEAKER_02]: particular cannabinoids or compounds as a
result that you find in the inflorescence
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plants and the flowers and so much
of the rest of the impact of the plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: its life cycle and the other constituents
in the plant are forgotten in these
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm reminded that in crop rotation with
wheat and corn hemp has shown 18% increase
[SPEAKER_02]: in yields in winter wheat for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just by being in rotation so when you're
talking about using the plant and multi
[SPEAKER_02]: product systems, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Producing more than just the cannabis,
simple things like crop rotation have been
[SPEAKER_02]: a part of the process that has been
forgotten because we weren't allowed to
[SPEAKER_02]: plant cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking even about completely
different production systems like
[SPEAKER_00]: combining it with aquaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can use leftovers from the medical
industry as a protein source for
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaculture, as a part of fish feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something completely different
which most people have not in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you start looking into nature where
the whole plant is used, when you produce
[SPEAKER_00]: something there's never waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: The term waste does not exist in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything which is a leftover,
which is not used by one system,
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used by someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lots of different production
systems which we can combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about insects, fantastic protein
source for maybe the future protein for
[SPEAKER_00]: humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insect production is an emerging field
like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis plant as a whole is
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about ready to wrap up Francesco.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your chance to speak to something
that you see on the horizon that's
[SPEAKER_02]: inspiring.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the immediate future there's a really
interesting nano formulation that is
[SPEAKER_04]: coming up combined with other botanical
compounds, so totally natural medicine for
[SPEAKER_04]: patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a huge project to bring compounds
with fiber as well because this is
[SPEAKER_04]: underrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over here everybody speaks about the
medical use, pharmaceutical use,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the amp industry is very underrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys don't want to invest because
it's too risky for the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, then invest in the amp industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Textile, buildings, compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a group of my colleagues who are
working on carbon fiber made by amp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unbelievable stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another project, the director is right up
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's bringing cannabis, amp, and all the
compounds secondary metabolites to space,
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really, really, really interesting
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking forward if any of you is
interested in this kind of research,
[SPEAKER_04]: just reach out and we can cooperate for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our philosophy is of cooperation instead
of competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to build a lot around us.
[SPEAKER_04]: With our partners, so partner up,
let's do things.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ICBC is a huge venue to meet,
so thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are out of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry we don't have time to get to
questions, but I'm sure we can have many
[SPEAKER_05]: discussions in the foyer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to thank our entire panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: This concludes today's panels at the
International Cannabis Business
Conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here is Berlin 2024.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Ungayo Bielam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm your host.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd like to thank the Talman Group.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will see you tonight at the party in
the showroom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Starts at nine o'clock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wear your badge and dress up a little if
you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, ciao.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
