[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, coming up right now, one of our
sponsors.
[SPEAKER_02]: This man is the founder and the CEO of
Grow Glide, and he's going to talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: vertical integration into your cannabis
farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Travis Schwartz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Travis Schwartz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlie Hodge.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going today, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Travis Schwartz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with Grow Glide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to need a minute while
they sort out some slide situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here you can see what we would consider
a single tier versus a multi-tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's two or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to talk about a few
different subjects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about California and
how vertical is taken off there of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis capital of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reasons why to go vertical, lessons
learned from our time in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: doing vertical, and the European
advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: In California, I was a pioneer for
cannabis in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this market continues to be one of the
strongest to date.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this picture, you are... Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This picture is kind of how in the early
days, there were very few large-scale
[SPEAKER_01]: black-marker grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you're seeing what we would call a
typical single-tiered, primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS-dominated image.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these were, as I said,
small-scale, really simple to set up,
[SPEAKER_01]: also called trap grows, and most people
were just kind of doing what worked
[SPEAKER_01]: mentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: In late 2018, the industry started to
evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: You started to see multi-tier coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the first solution providers were
storage innovators who made slight changes
[SPEAKER_01]: to their product and labeled them for
indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The picture here is a kind of generation
one of a grow glide rack with an
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated drainage and slope drainage
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, they're on wheels to optimize
the floor space.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a very robust market going
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last 18 months, we've seen vertical
cannabis explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most investors no longer tolerate
single-tier builds, and growers have
[SPEAKER_01]: adapted to the complexity of vertical
cultivation in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost impossible to gauge the market
potential of the future for new builds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we've determined that the old
single-tiered market that can be converted
[SPEAKER_01]: is roughly $2 billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of my favorite pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually some of the guys from
Jungle Boys and the Cure Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're visiting one of our customers in
Long Beach, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: This picture is taken on a third tier,
which is about five meters up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people would believe that you can't
grow a quality product in a multi-tier
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, you can see from this picture
that that is, in fact, not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key to the success is proper planning
and products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to touch on the vertical
advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by going vertical, you obviously can
increase your ROI by up to 300% or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many times, cultivation licensing is tied
to an actual single address.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by utilizing your existing height and
floor space, you can increase the ROI
[SPEAKER_01]: without additional licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last but not least, environmentally,
with proper planning and vertical,
[SPEAKER_01]: growers can minimize land waste,
power waste, and water waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an entrepreneur, I know firsthand how
exciting it is to build a new business and
[SPEAKER_01]: how quickly it can fall apart if you skip
over the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lessons that we've learned is
planning, planning, and planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor planning leads to poor performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we love multi-tier and are huge
advocates.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's not a magic cure-all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proper preparation is critical to the
success of your vertical grow and the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits that you all want to achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: These three key issues that we're going to
cover next are the difference between a
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical grow that's successful and a
never-ending headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those three key things are going to be
workflow, microclimates, and safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Workflow is obviously from the beginning
designing your building to thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: your team's best efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Workflow is going to be crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microclimates is by far the number one
biggest issue that people don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: about when they go to a multi-tier grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the issues with humidity and
temperature across the different levels
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And growing at sales is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing at quality is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proper airflow is going to be the number
one biggest thing, which I just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got to get that air to move
around both within the layer and up and
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a few solutions on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to talk about those more later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then last but not least is safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your cultivation team is going to be
working at heights up to 15, 20 feet off
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are they protected?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the safety processes you have in
place?
[SPEAKER_01]: The European advantage is obvious in that
you guys have had the advantage of being
[SPEAKER_01]: first to market and really innovative in
the agriculture space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you can watch and learn from some of
the mistakes that we've made.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the early pioneers of vertical
cannabis in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Europe's big ag industry has some major
innovators.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the Inn Farms to the Nordic Harvest,
these companies are really making
[SPEAKER_01]: headlines today and for the last decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis cultivators can lean on this open
attitude and really skip the single tier
[SPEAKER_01]: growing phase the US is currently
transitioning out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of you may have had the chance to
meet our new team member.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Ludwig Simon has joined us,
who is the head of operations at one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the largest vertical farming ag operations
here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's joined GrowGuide's team as the GM
of Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you haven't had a chance to catch
him, come see him in our booth,
[SPEAKER_01]: number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm going to kind of cover some of
the predictions that I anticipate to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen in Europe as it relates to vertical
cultivation based on the experience in the
US.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously the demand for European
cannabis will be robust.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Jamie Pearson mentioned this morning,
it's likely to be very underestimated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany on its own has the potential to be
a $4 billion market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, the US multi-tier is rapidly
going to continue to shift to a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: count of tiers and they're going to focus
on utilizing SAS software solutions to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure consistency and quality throughout
their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will continue to be consolidation
among multi-tier vendors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I believe that flour will always
remain king from a product standpoint,
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction, which requires high volume of
flour to make various products from resins
[SPEAKER_01]: to rosins to edibles, et cetera,
those are going to continue to skyrocket
[SPEAKER_01]: as the market in Europe continues to
mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is going to be a true cash crop
driving further innovation in the overall
[SPEAKER_01]: ag tech market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The overlap between ag and cannabis
cultivation will continue to increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point, I believe that vertical
ag is actually starting to learn from
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical cannabis versus the other way
around it's been going for the last
[SPEAKER_01]: decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: More technology tools will continue to be
created to help cultivators plan a
[SPEAKER_01]: successful operation from that workflow,
climate and safety standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stealing this idea from Jamie Pearson,
but we're going to have lots of time for
[SPEAKER_01]: questions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a quick QR code in case
somebody wants to download this
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation to learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd love to open it up to any types of
questions that people have as it relates
[SPEAKER_01]: to vertical ag, airflow, workflow,
anything along those fronts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I know I speak really fast,
so I'm sorry for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Young lady in the red.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I have to give you in order to have
you prepare what I need, how much advance
[SPEAKER_04]: time do you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, let's do it into the microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on a minute, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm building out a grow, how much time
do I have to give you?
[SPEAKER_05]: At what point in the process do I need to
come talk to you about what I need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to go back to the planning phase,
as early as possible, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have cultivators who come to us who
don't have a building yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, you're in the planning phase
before really anything has been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times our team is very
knowledgeable from we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators on the team and they can
actually help you kind of design your
[SPEAKER_01]: project around workflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, we're seeing people talking to
us anywhere from, I would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: 8 to 12 months before their facility is
actually, they're ready to install the
[SPEAKER_01]: racking system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also comes, we have people who show
up a month before they need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more planning, the better success
you're going to have in the long run,
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Plan ahead, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always tell people, especially in this
industry, start early, you're high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys all waiting for the
translation to go through?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you learned everything you can today?
[SPEAKER_02]: No more, no one has any questions at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it triple your yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: At least.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least!
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that's all the questions I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have another question, Jamie?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything that you've been asked
here that's been surprising when you were
[SPEAKER_05]: out on the expo hall that has given you
pause about what's happening in Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the most notable thing that
I've learned is that some areas are
[SPEAKER_01]: farther, much farther ahead than I would
have anticipated as far as places that are
[SPEAKER_01]: operational.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've also heard from a handful of
people who seem to have more knowledge in
[SPEAKER_01]: the space than I that Germany likely will
take longer to get recreational open than
[SPEAKER_01]: they anticipate just due to the things
going on in the world right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that both the positive and
negative, the negative being Germany is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be behind, but everywhere else
seems to be much more ahead or prepared.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you retrofit existing grows?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely can retrofit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you're going to have
limitations to deal with, whether that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what your ceiling height is, that's
generally your biggest limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, do you have enough power to
convert to a multi-tier from both the
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting perspective and the HVAC
perspective?
[SPEAKER_05]: Jump in if anyone else has questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have a question, another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you do this with sodium halogen lights
or does it have to be LED?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely can.
[SPEAKER_01]: My co-founder Darren actually started with
HPS for multi-tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need probably an extra 12 to 18
inches per tier in order to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: have the spacing to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's 100% possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many tiers can you go up?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're unlimited based on your ceiling
height.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done up to six tiers before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably need about 28 feet,
which is about nine, I think, meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most people are in that, you need
about 15 feet to do two tiers,
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 to 15, and ideally 18 to 20 feet,
so five and a half meters, to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: three-tiered system for flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Systems nowadays, like grow glides,
is very adjustable, so you can fit it in
[SPEAKER_01]: two-inch increments to come up with
whatever size you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our motto is to help growers grow how they
want to, not tell them how they need to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys give virtual help so you don't
necessarily have to go right to the
[SPEAKER_05]: physical grow?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, somebody in Europe, if you're back
in America, you can work with them over
[SPEAKER_05]: Zoom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's actually how we work with
most of our customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a full team of about 10 on our
solutions team who's able to walk you
[SPEAKER_01]: through the process, get the
specifications from you that you would
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over Zoom, we have some really cool room
generation tools where you can kind of see
[SPEAKER_01]: your product in real time, and we also
send out, we have some virtual reality
[SPEAKER_01]: type applications to where you can see a
360 view of the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, are there any more questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fine, the one in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can shout it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was texting my friend in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was about to do a 25,000 square foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on my way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wore the comfortable shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was texting my friend in Arizona who's
doing a 25,000 square foot four-tier grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he's like, this sounds fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can I come see this guy and what he
can do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we're based out of Riverside,
Southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a full showroom there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about 70 cultivations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we've installed in the last 12
months, totaling about a half a million
[SPEAKER_01]: square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are spread across about 12 states,
and we do have a handful of those
[SPEAKER_01]: customers who will allow scheduled visits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say Southern California,
we could probably swing one in Arizona
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you brought the future to this
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because vertical farming will be the
future in terms of protection of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lands, and in terms of sustainability of
the planet, health, quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we need more and more
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Travis Schwartz, CEO and co-founder of
Grow Glide, growglide.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow Glide for all your growing and
gliding needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
