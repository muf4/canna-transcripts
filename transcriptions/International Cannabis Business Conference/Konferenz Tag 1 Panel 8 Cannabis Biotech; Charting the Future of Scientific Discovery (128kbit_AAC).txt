[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so excited to be here at the Cannabis
Biotech and ICBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I speak at a lot of cannabis conferences,
and I feel that people are always
[SPEAKER_02]: fangirling.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am fangirling over this panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a really good panel if
you're interested in medical cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trials and biotechnology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really excited to get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, let's get our waters open,
and we can get started.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start with introductions so we know
who we're talking to today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So would you like to go first,
since you're beside me?
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have introduced myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the panel, I'm Terry O'Regan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm president of Brain's Biomedical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have been in the industry two years,
and prior to that, I was in the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pharmaceutical being sort of big pharma.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Clemens Pancic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with my brother, co-founder of
Company Plan Z.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a startup developing plant
injections, so plant infusion,
[SPEAKER_03]: which yields more product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my background is in biomedical
research as well as software for life
[SPEAKER_03]: sciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Michael Sasano.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm CEO of So My Pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a manufacturing facility for
cannabis containing products based in
[SPEAKER_00]: Lisbon, Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Simon Nicolussi.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm CSO of the Scoli Pharma Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: My background is pharmaceutical sciences.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a pharmacist by myself, so I have also
some role in the public pharmacy,
[SPEAKER_05]: in doing compounding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Farther, I did some research, preclinical
and clinical research.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my focus was always in the thesis on
the endocannabinoid system research.
[SPEAKER_05]: So happy to join in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an incredible panel here today,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be your moderator today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am Antoine Gomez, the CEO and founder of
Peak Farm Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peak Farm Labs is a cannabis
pharmaceutical company focusing on sexual
[SPEAKER_02]: health ailments.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're known for our cannabis suppositories
for endometriosis on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing cannabis for 10 years in
medical cannabis, so I love this type of
[SPEAKER_02]: talk, and I can talk about it forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm excited to get into it today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the panel that we have here today,
I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are at the forefront of medical
cannabis right now all around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have so many different countries here
speaking with us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious to ask you guys,
what are the biggest breakthroughs that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're seeing in medical cannabis biotech
advancements that are helping shape health
[SPEAKER_02]: care today?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really getting excited about the fact
that I've most probably looked at over
[SPEAKER_04]: 1,000 clinical studies at the moment,
and just the range in which evidence is
[SPEAKER_04]: being generated at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really, for me, is a new chapter in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was always about THC and CBD,
but we're starting to understand the
[SPEAKER_04]: benefits of CBG, of CBN, of the acid
forms, and looking at potentially mapping
[SPEAKER_04]: these different cannabinoids out,
and seeing being really quite targeted
[SPEAKER_04]: about where they could have their main
benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, that is great, because that's
in parallel with what Pharma was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pharma was moving into a phase called
personalized medicine, recognizing that
[SPEAKER_04]: not everybody responded the same way,
and you needed to personalize the
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in some ways, this industry
could lead in that area about really being
[SPEAKER_04]: able to personalize what's going to have
the best impact on different cohorts of
[SPEAKER_04]: consumers or patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fascinating the way how cannabis
helps with our homeostasis, and it helps
[SPEAKER_02]: with body temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's so many different ways that it
can help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really exciting to see CBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one I'm really excited about as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you guys like to add to that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I get excited about the
technological aspect of growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've seen that in the past
decades, we went from growing it
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculturally to really growing it
high-tech, indoor growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I am very excited about is adding
more real-time sensorics, real-time
[SPEAKER_03]: analytics to the growth, because better
than I do, but it's not just the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids, but the ratios between them,
so how to get things right, how to get
[SPEAKER_03]: things just right for the right patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's really, really cool to see
also coming to this event to see how
[SPEAKER_03]: high-tech is entering both for how to
input, how to modify the plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: and also how to monitor what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in one side, when you look at it from
a manufacturer's standpoint, in one way,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're trying to make products for today,
products that can be sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Products that are, in most cases,
generic in sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have your Magisterio Prep 1010
as an example, this is not something where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have some IP protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something interesting, when you make
products, even if you're making them for a
[SPEAKER_01]: marketable product, you get a lot of calls
from people in the pharmaceutical industry
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to make different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one interesting trend that I've been
seeing lately and getting a lot of calls
[SPEAKER_01]: on is actual drug manufacturers looking
how they can take the cannabinoids or the
[SPEAKER_01]: distillers or CBD or THC or CBG and add
that to an already existing medical API.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, one group, without naming
names, they wanted to take lidocaine and
[SPEAKER_01]: add it to CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't understand what that effect
was, but I found it most interesting that
[SPEAKER_01]: people want to take an already approved
drug and add a cannabinoid to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure of the efficacy or how
they're going to use it, but it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting trend.
[SPEAKER_05]: To follow up on this combination is
already given by cannabis itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, I would say, complex enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand the approach of adding it to
lidocaine or whatever active substance,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we are maybe already on the one edge
while physicians not even understand how
[SPEAKER_05]: to start the therapy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the feedbacks is start simple,
like one milligram THC once in the
[SPEAKER_05]: evening, once a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a very simple concept, which is just
one active substance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, an extract makes more sense from
another point of view because the terpenes
[SPEAKER_05]: add additional effect through the
entourage, and certain fractions are even
[SPEAKER_05]: more effective than others.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when it comes to plants, what's
drained will be the source to manufacture
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the personalized medicine
will, in the end, be the difference,
[SPEAKER_05]: as you said, Antoinette, with the
prescription on an individual basis on the
[SPEAKER_05]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the moment, we have THC and CBD,
but yes, there will be other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most likely, CBN will be one of the
next one, while regulators lag behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in certain countries like Switzerland,
they don't even know how to handle it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's already on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the potential is there, and we want to
make use of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it for sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that we talked a lot about
terpenes, clinical trials, the latest
[SPEAKER_02]: advancements in biotech.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much medicinal therapeutic
effects from this plant, from the terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: to the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think something that I found,
which is really cool, a new startup called
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinerta is doing cannabis medical products
with the cannabis plant, but everything
[SPEAKER_02]: but the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really excited about the future of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Myself, we're doing a clinical trial for
our suppositories, for endometriosis,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm really excited to see what they
have for colitis and other things as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shall I respond?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an open conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to be a little bit
controversial, and I'm sure you've heard
[SPEAKER_04]: of a saying that a strength overplayed
becomes a weakness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've used it with my children all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't overplay your strengths.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, I think the wonder and the
beauty about cannabis is it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: complicated plant with all of these
potential benefits and the terpenes and
[SPEAKER_04]: the flavonoids and the different
cannabinoids and all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a treasure chest.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the challenge with cannabis is it's
got all of these different cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_04]: and all of these different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there was a question that was
asked in my talk earlier, which is when is
[SPEAKER_04]: big pharma going to get involved in the
cannabis sector?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think one of the challenges is this,
is we have to make sense of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now this is where I'm going to get a
little bit controversial, which is we've
[SPEAKER_04]: got to know what we're prescribing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to know what is in the makeup of
whatever it is you're prescribing,
[SPEAKER_04]: because they do behave so differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I've seen is that there are drug
interactions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that THC potentially has a very
narrow therapeutic window.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you have a flower that is very
high in THC and somebody has an underlying
[SPEAKER_04]: cardiac condition or somebody has
glaucoma, you could find yourself
[SPEAKER_04]: prescribing something where you think it's
going to be beneficial, but potentially
[SPEAKER_04]: could have a detrimental side effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I saw a study last week,
which in a glaucoma study, where high
[SPEAKER_04]: levels of THC actually accelerated the
route to blindness rather than actually
[SPEAKER_04]: addressed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once again, I'm so grateful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please don't see me as trying to have a go
at anybody that's in medical cannabis or
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody that is a huge supporter of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason we at Brains Biaceutical have
gone down the isolate route is it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: path of least resistance to some degree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pharma and regulators want to know exactly
what is in the capsule or what is in the
[SPEAKER_04]: pill.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so being able to extract it and then
reconstitute it with what we want to put
[SPEAKER_04]: into it, what Clement said over here about
we know that there's different ratios and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's different percentages.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can play around with that and then
do the studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all I'm saying is, and I'm trying to
get the debate going as well, but I think
[SPEAKER_04]: we as an industry need to make sure that
A, quality is at its utmost at the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondly, we know what is in whatever it
is we're prescribing or we're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: research in it and that we educate whoever
is the user or the prescriber around where
[SPEAKER_04]: the benefit lies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just now that you were talking,
I thought of one challenge that we were
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about at the National Institute of
Biology is not only like is it the
[SPEAKER_03]: interaction between like individuals and
the individual strengths and the ultimate
[SPEAKER_03]: ratios of cannabinoids and other compounds
is complex, but there is also,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, in the case of treating
tumors and cancers where there is no hard
[SPEAKER_03]: evidence or FDA-grade evidence that it
works, but there are people that got cured
[SPEAKER_03]: by using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is another element which is how do
these interactions how does the
[SPEAKER_03]: interaction between the cannabinoids,
the person, the patient, and the tumor
[SPEAKER_03]: which has also their own genetics,
how does this work?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, I see a challenge for big
pharma because, or FDA for that matter,
[SPEAKER_03]: how the drugs get approved is this is a
compound, we know exactly what it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does this, it blocks a certain pathway
and therefore there is no disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is far, far more complex and
just the traditional way of trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand it's not gonna work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'm curious what others think
about what needs to change.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's certainly difficult to get
the market authorization for a herbal
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal product, but there are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have very complex extracts
already that are used since decades.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, for the treatment of
depression, we have St. Jonesward extract
[SPEAKER_05]: or, for example, specific lavender extract
that is used for the treatment of anxiety.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these studies, I mean, there are like
14, 15 clinical trials that were needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Safety studies and coming back to that
evidence, you have the three pillars that
[SPEAKER_05]: have to be followed and these are safety,
efficacy, and quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a manufacturer, you have to take
into account all the quality and document
[SPEAKER_05]: it, while physicians have to bring the
evidence on the efficacy on the safety
[SPEAKER_05]: level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a cannabis extract can go the same
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what was shown for Sativex,
for example, which is an extract
[SPEAKER_05]: combination, but you can use actually
extracts that are compliant to monographs
[SPEAKER_05]: currently at the stage of the DAB for
example in Germany that will go to the
[SPEAKER_05]: Pharmacopeia Europea.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have the basis for that and
it can be also manufactured directly as a
[SPEAKER_05]: magistral compounding preparation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that allows forms like suppositories,
capsules.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oils are the current state, but when it
comes to an authorization, this is a
[SPEAKER_05]: completely different story.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you need the CTD.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a common technical document which
fulfills all the modules of quality,
[SPEAKER_05]: safety, and efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times when you look at it,
when you boil it down into your own world,
[SPEAKER_01]: what does it mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to always look at it from a
manufacturer's standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're trying to make a product that
can come to market and you also have to
[SPEAKER_01]: realize the timing of the markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you take a look and you say,
okay, I want to boil this down to a single
[SPEAKER_01]: element, I want CBD isolate, pure THC
isolate, and you're looking at making a
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine because you can analyze that
single element much simpler than you could
[SPEAKER_01]: analyze the effects on the body of a full
spectrum extract as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in one side you're trying to reach
that market that's looking at the single
[SPEAKER_01]: elements, or in one side you're trying to
reach that market that's looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: herbal extracts and the therapeutics
effects of terpenes, minor cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then trying to match what one side
wants and another side wants and
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacture them that product,
that is the trick that we're always trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to solve in manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to some extent, it's not just making
the product, it becomes what do the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators accept?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can go country by country and each
one is coming
[SPEAKER_01]: up with a different way of looking at the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a complication that us as
manufacturers have to address on a
[SPEAKER_01]: constant basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, tons of hurdles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked a lot about clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this because it's so important and
I think it's a huge differentiator for
[SPEAKER_02]: adult use versus medical care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that they should be held to a
higher standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to add, because you did
mention Terry, that pharma isn't in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pharma is very much in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so happy that Bayer put together the
first cannabis and endometriosis event,
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically for endo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that goes back to what you
were saying is that we need to create
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs that are specific to certain
diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way how we can,
it's not, cannabis is great for so many
[SPEAKER_02]: things, but it's not great for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can create cannabis drugs specific
for certain ailments, which is very
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, there is pharma is like jazz
pharmaceutical bought GW.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know that pharma has a presence
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think all I was trying to say,
and I think to Simon's point, is we've got
[SPEAKER_04]: to be very comfortable that if you,
in the prescribing flower or broad
[SPEAKER_04]: spectrum or whatever, the path to giving
patients access to that is most probably
[SPEAKER_04]: different compared to if you're in a
clinical trial program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both will service a very different
cohort of patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both are absolutely required.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the one does require robust clinical
evidence, proof of concept studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to make sure that you have been
approved by the local authorities,
[SPEAKER_04]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a clinical trial program,
unfortunately, there is only one way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pre-clin phase one, phase two,
phase three.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of them take time and they take
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's when the Novartises and
the GSKs and the big pharma, I know Pfizer
[SPEAKER_04]: has dipped their toe into here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they've just canceled,
just to stop that program.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I long to see people follow there and
get into this market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that it's clear that we're all
here for patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, we've seen how it's
helped people from all different walks of
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious, when it comes to clinical
trials, what barriers are you guys facing
[SPEAKER_02]: and how are you getting around them?
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm interested, maybe Simon,
you know more.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I really liked was the,
they did in UK, I believe, they did this,
[SPEAKER_03]: the world evidence-based clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this makes a lot more sense for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Real world evidence is maybe, I can say
it's a collection of the anecdotal
[SPEAKER_05]: evidence that exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the acceptance by authority is
currently really in very early stage for
[SPEAKER_05]: approval purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe they allow a certain use extension
for authorized drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you come along and say,
hey, we have a nice real world evidence
[SPEAKER_05]: study with 30,000 patients, well done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Published in a good journal, good
protocol, you follow all the rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will say, oh, we're very sorry,
it's insufficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gold standard is a randomized
controlled trial.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is where the problem comes in.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need the placebo control, you need a
nice competitor like in pain, you're
[SPEAKER_05]: treated against morphine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would bet that dronabinol as a single
substance would lose against morphine.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you choose, and this is now coming back
to the hurdle of what are the problems in
[SPEAKER_05]: clinical trials?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you choose the wrong primary endpoint,
you will fail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And never go into pain, you will fail.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you say it's the primary endpoint to
reduce pain, you will fail.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of the biggest challenges
anyways in clinical trials to overcome the
[SPEAKER_05]: placebo effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that the endocannabinoid system is
significantly producing the placebo effect
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why on top, I mean, it's part of
the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying that cannabis is a placebo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to overcome the effect with
significance and with the clinical
[SPEAKER_05]: relevance, secondly, is important to show
the regulators then that the data is
[SPEAKER_05]: sufficient to get the market
authorization.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my approach after, let's say,
seven years in pharma industry is now with
[SPEAKER_05]: the Scoli Pharma to make, on the magistral
compounding way, APIs that are
[SPEAKER_05]: manufactured like from Somai in a high
quality, available to the patients by
[SPEAKER_05]: direct compounding and dispensing in a
pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a faster way, and it's
accepted.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, authority most likely is or won't
like it because they prefer the
[SPEAKER_05]: authorization.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if someone is in the audience
from the Bayfarm current at the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope not, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is actually the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like this, also evidence is created on
the basis of simple oils.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when it comes to more interesting
formulations like a sublingual patch or an
[SPEAKER_05]: encapsulated oil, then it's a different
story.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there, we have the possibility to
create evidence, provide it to the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulators, and go the way of the
prescribed compounding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is maybe a little bit my favorite
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be happy to join a clinical trial
program, like a phase one study on that
[SPEAKER_05]: point also.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for me, you've got to know what
your goal is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I would say there's a clinical
trial light that what you want to do is
[SPEAKER_04]: show a signal, and so that you can give
physicians confidence to prescribe the
[SPEAKER_04]: product for certain conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, those studies don't always
translate to studies that can be approved
[SPEAKER_04]: by the regulators.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because with the regulators, you know,
the very first thing a phase one study is
[SPEAKER_04]: all about is it safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you've got to make sure you've done
a proper pre-clin program.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to make sure that you have done
a dose response curve.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm amazed at how many times people sort
of almost guess, let's try this dose and
[SPEAKER_04]: see if it works, rather than we've done a
dose response curve.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the studies that I've seen at
the moment, there's an inverse response
[SPEAKER_04]: with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that there comes an optimal point
and then at that point it actually becomes
[SPEAKER_04]: detrimental or the therapeutic effect is
diminished.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I think for me, know why
you're doing this study.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then make sure that you know the
criteria by which that study will be
[SPEAKER_04]: approved by whoever is the authority that
needs to approve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you were saying about compounding
cannabis, I think that's the perfect place
[SPEAKER_02]: that cannabis should be is in pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I love Hybrid Farm, Canada's first
licensed pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we started with our cannabis
suppositories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got to see all these patients with
their feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as we started manufacturing
them at a way higher level, we noticed
[SPEAKER_02]: that there was far more efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love that there's opportunity and
there is space for pharmacy, but we should
[SPEAKER_02]: be a lot more open to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish Canada would be a little bit more
open.
[SPEAKER_02]: People need to learn from Hybrid Farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just for Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And which brings me to my next question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we are, it's really exciting to
be at the front of a new drug,
[SPEAKER_02]: a new plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm curious from you, from you all,
what are some ethical considerations that
[SPEAKER_02]: we should be thinking about when it comes
to the clinical trials or manufacturing of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, you know, I always keep staying
on, I'll keep continuing on my
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as you look as a manufacturer,
you get a lot of people and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists and a lot of doctors that come
through and they want things a certain way
[SPEAKER_01]: and they want it mixed a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you listen to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, in one way you want to
remain neutral and you're providing them
[SPEAKER_01]: with a product that they can do testing
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: On another side, you know, especially in
the cannabis industry, since you have
[SPEAKER_01]: markets like the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Canada, they have a different
perception than in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're coming up with, let's say,
solutions that may or may not possibly be
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: One solution that I had saw not so long
ago is something common in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: which carries an enzymatic inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought to myself, you know,
how can this possibly be good for somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: who may be taking medication for something
seriously and there is no warning sign and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're selling this commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And although it's not something we would
produce here in Europe, it goes to the
[SPEAKER_01]: ethical question of what you can and
cannot provide and how you need to label
[SPEAKER_01]: that and what kind of testing needs to go
through with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have a market that's not
regulated, like the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: market, and it's regulated more on a
restaurant quality basis where there is
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody saying you can or cannot put that
in there, you do have ethical questions
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to ask yourselves in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think less so here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the excipients you use,
the ingredients you use, how you use them,
[SPEAKER_01]: the quality standards, that is
attributable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less of an ethical matter and it's
more of a testing matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, this would come to mind
when you ask that kind of question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are really bold to get out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, got to take a consideration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your thoughts as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I see, like, let's say that,
well, cannabis is going to be accepted
[SPEAKER_03]: more and more as, you know, by pharma and
approved.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a potential side effect of this or a
negative effect, like, that it's then
[SPEAKER_03]: perceived as cannabis being like a safe
plant to use recreationally as well,
[SPEAKER_03]: which to some extent that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But especially in, you know, in younger
adults, it can have really bad effects on
[SPEAKER_03]: mental health, mental development.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my concern with, you know, this being
taken over by pharma and heavily marketed,
[SPEAKER_03]: what kind of impact it will have on,
you know, people that will now consider it
[SPEAKER_03]: safer than it actually is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the biggest challenges for
me is that because it is a natural plant
[SPEAKER_04]: and because we've got so much anecdotal
evidence, we can sometimes only look at
[SPEAKER_04]: the benefits of it, but we've also got to
look at some of the challenges or some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the side effects with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys are the most optimistic group
that I've ever worked with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in pharma, we always, you know,
the glass is always half full.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never half empty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never half full.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we do need to be aware that,
you know, that particularly if people have
[SPEAKER_04]: concomitant therapies or underlying
conditions, that we need to be aware of
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know, you know, that some of the
cannabinoids actually suppress the immune
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also know that the cannabinoids are
broken down through your P450 cytochrome
[SPEAKER_04]: pathway, which is where your oncology
drugs are broken down, where your
[SPEAKER_04]: epileptic drugs are broken down,
your antidepressants and whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could actually have drug
interactions or you could actually,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, diminish the therapeutic effect
of your chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've seen that in certain
indications.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we know that they come with side
effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, THC in particular stimulates
your CB1 receptors, which from a cardiac
[SPEAKER_04]: point of view, if you've got an underlying
cardiac condition, that could be really
[SPEAKER_04]: serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, you know, I think we just got
to be really aware of not only the
[SPEAKER_04]: positives, but also where the limitations
are and be upfront and honest about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, also from a safety point of view,
the concerns are of novel cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_05]: coming into human already now as a food
supplement or also in waves.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can be very high dose and they do
have an effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are lucky that cannabinoids are,
from a toxicological point of view,
[SPEAKER_05]: not leading to death.
[SPEAKER_05]: In that way, when those in high,
you have your intoxication, but they are
[SPEAKER_05]: in a way safe, but therapeutic window is
still have to be taken into account.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there, you're perfectly right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the pharmacokinetic interactions,
for example, of CBD to inhibit P450
[SPEAKER_05]: cytochromes, it's absolutely important to
mention to patients, especially when you
[SPEAKER_05]: are not labeling it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the moment, there is only,
to the best of my knowledge, one
[SPEAKER_05]: authorized CBD drug that contains the
proper labeling in the SMPC and in the
[SPEAKER_05]: patient information leaflet, not to take
it in combination with or always under
[SPEAKER_05]: doctor's prescription.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you don't want to actually have a bad
impact on, let's say, a pro drug that
[SPEAKER_05]: would make your blood thin and it doesn't
work anymore and then it leads to some
[SPEAKER_05]: more severe effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this is about, let's say, ethics,
a responsibility that we have to see and
[SPEAKER_05]: where we have to provide also evidence
from a safety point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, safety and access, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what I love about ICBC is that we have
a lot of people here from all around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have policy makers, we have
manufacturers, we have a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: from so many different walks of life in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredibly powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm curious from you guys what your
thoughts are on how policy, government,
[SPEAKER_02]: academia, universities work together at
the cannabis industry to accelerate
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's a no-brainer that this
research needs to be done, done before,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, even adult use legalization,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what are your thoughts and how can we
accelerate this research?
[SPEAKER_02]: And have you seen other companies do that,
partner together in terms of government,
[SPEAKER_02]: academia, and manufacturing?
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that's nice that I can point to
in the EU is, I mean, at least I can speak
[SPEAKER_01]: for Portugal and I'm sure it's for other
countries, I'm just not aware of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government seem extremely supportive
through research and development grants
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can get up to 70% of your money
back that you invest in what they would
[SPEAKER_01]: call gray matter, you know, in your brain
power to create IP and create development.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something pretty unique that the
governments actually support you in that
[SPEAKER_01]: way and cannabis has access to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, for people, I always say,
always try to encourage people that come
[SPEAKER_01]: through to try to get on those
applications or to at least think about
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're released every so often and to be,
you know, up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's an easy way for,
let's say, an industry that's not as
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalized as the larger groups,
the Pfizer's and the Merck's, where they
[SPEAKER_01]: have a lot more money to research things
and have interest in many areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for ours, at least, there is access
and there are places where people can get
[SPEAKER_01]: access currently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe from a Swiss perspective and,
yeah, Switzerland is one of the most
[SPEAKER_05]: innovative countries in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the possibility to, in a small and
very dynamic and very progressive project
[SPEAKER_05]: which is inter-professionally built,
to push forward certain medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: applications and then there is a direct
link to the regulators that will see the
[SPEAKER_05]: data also.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's, in a way, evidence has to be
created.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the basis and acceleration of that
process, in my opinion, always needs like
[SPEAKER_05]: a doctor, it needs maybe a pharmacist,
but it also needs the nurses and it also
[SPEAKER_05]: needs the patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, there must be work going on working
groups that are diverse and that cover all
[SPEAKER_05]: ranges from, let's say, the plant to the
patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, on top of that, you need an
education program to communicate that good
[SPEAKER_05]: data that you have generated because if
you don't talk about it, no one will know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And authority, they don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You must teach them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you must show them the data.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't just trust like a lot of people
do because they have an effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: These cannabinoids, we know that,
but if you show that on paper to
[SPEAKER_05]: non-users, to non-patients and at
authority sites, then they will accept it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it must be an interplay, a teamwork.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a great example is I work really
closely with the Endometriosis Society of
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we sponsor their events.
[SPEAKER_02]: We share all of the medical education that
we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We share a doctor if they ever need one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've also brought work to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought the University of Sydney,
Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing the clinical trial on
endometriosis and they were looking for a
[SPEAKER_02]: product and they recommended us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think that if you aren't working in
medical cannabis, I think that's a great
[SPEAKER_02]: way to accelerate is really building your
community in that specific disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that goes back to what Michael
was saying is that these products should
[SPEAKER_02]: be by, you know, for specific ailments
because it's going to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're almost wrapping up soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I wanted to also ask you guys,
you know, what do you want people to leave
[SPEAKER_02]: here with about knowing about medical
cannabis and biotech and what you think
[SPEAKER_02]: the future will be?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that a lot can happen in
the next decade.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot has happened in this decade in
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I would love for that to be the last
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can start.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think what I would ask of all of
you is whatever field you are in,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it is in medical cannabis,
whether it's in drug development,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it is in nutraceutical and
over-the-counter products, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: just set yourself the highest bar
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's just so concerning that
every time the Swiss canton of pharmacies
[SPEAKER_04]: do an audit and 95% of products have to be
removed from the shelf because they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: meet the spec.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they either haven't got enough
active ingredient or the impurity levels
[SPEAKER_04]: are too high or whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, for me, it's just, you know,
ultimately, we need each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's not one silver bullet
here that's going to solve it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all need to work together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And collectively, we need all of the
different areas that you're in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's not tarnish the industry and
confirm what pharma and some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: politicians think, you know, with their
skeptic minds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's show them that we can set the
highest bar and pioneer in personalized
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine, evidence generation,
etc.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and kind of actually to your point,
also from the starting question,
[SPEAKER_03]: right, what gets me excited is the
technological advancements with growing
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, here I see, like, also as a take-home
message, you know, if we're going towards
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical industry, basically
creating a biological drug, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in that sense, as a standard,
as a way of doing biological drugs,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have these huge bioreactors with,
you know, exact control what goes in,
[SPEAKER_03]: what comes out, real-time sensorics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, like, you know, cannabis,
it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have that built in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are going towards there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a lot of technology that's
out there that can be implemented.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, machine vision, our company does
infusion for the plants so you can control
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly what goes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are companies here that we met that
do real-time measurements of various
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds that can indicate the health of
the plant, obviously cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid composition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, to your point, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to, it's exciting, but also the
whole industry needs to professionalize.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's happening, the growth, the production
facilities need to get to that point where
[SPEAKER_03]: it's very clear what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: We understand the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We understand what goes in, what comes
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's, I think, one of the
crucial paths forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as a closing idea, in cannabis,
there's something for everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how you're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you have the well-known
Epidiolex and Satvex in the people,
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe 1,000 plus different trials that
are going on now at that kind of a level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also the herbal medicine
medicinal level, you know, another level
[SPEAKER_01]: that people can participate in.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can participate on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, you don't have to just go out
and try, if you're thinking biotech,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're thinking IP protection,
you're thinking these drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's little things that you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you gotta look at that for
where is the reality of what you're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe there's a place for
everybody inside of this space,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you just have to unlock it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think to maximize the medical use of
this cannabis plant and to have the
[SPEAKER_05]: potential really used in different
diseases and indications, we have to
[SPEAKER_05]: partner up and to create scientific
evidence together so that also regulators
[SPEAKER_05]: are further convinced.
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, this is actually at high
pharmaceutical standards necessary,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, and in the end will help the
whole industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that tip on entrepreneurship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even if you're, you know, growing in
your career in cannabis, this is a very
[SPEAKER_02]: long game, and I think it's just about
keep going and, you know, partnering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Partnering together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that there is a place for
everyone here as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so much potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really up to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
