[SPEAKER_06]: And our new panelists are moving in.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had a small change.
[SPEAKER_06]: Giada de Carter is feeling a little under
the weather.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, in her place, to moderate this panel
on conventional industries, shifting to
[SPEAKER_06]: food, pharma, and consumerism,
the one and only, the head of loose
[SPEAKER_06]: brands, Toronto, Canada's favorite,
Torontonian, is it Torontonian?
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't play for the Maple Leafs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't play... Canada's favorite
non-Maple Leaf Torontonian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it for Alex Revich.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know after the after party, it's always
a little tough, but hopefully everyone had
[SPEAKER_05]: their coffee and they're ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very interesting panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very excited to be able to jump in and
talk to these great people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know some of them and got a
chance to meet some new people,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I always love.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this topic is a very interesting one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna be talking about conventional
industries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the shift from food, pharma,
and consumerism, because we've had so much
[SPEAKER_05]: changes in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're gonna find it very
interesting, especially with this great
[SPEAKER_05]: panel that I have up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll let them introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll introduce myself and then we'll jump
right into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, why don't we kick it off right here?
[SPEAKER_09]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name's Paul Long, CEO of Little Green
Pharma.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we are a medical cannabis company
based in Australia and in Europe.
[SPEAKER_09]: We sit across the entire supply chain.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, we provide medical products into,
as I said, the Australian market.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're one of the larger brands in that
market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've been pretty active in the
European market for the last four or five
[SPEAKER_09]: years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have a big side up in Denmark that
we're producing.
[SPEAKER_09]: The topic of commoditization, I think
we're gonna touch on today.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's very interesting for us as a
company.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very interesting here in Germany,
but also in Australia.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think for everyone in the audience,
understanding what that means and how that
[SPEAKER_09]: will play out in a market that's
legalizing is going to be an interesting
[SPEAKER_09]: topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Bernie Young.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the CEO of Atlas Global Brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're based out of Canada, where we have
an EUGNP hub based out of Chatham,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ontario, as well as a second facility in
Stratford, Ontario, where we sell EUGNP
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, extracts, vapes, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been in this space for seven plus
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very lucky to be with this panel
as we look at the opportunities and take
[SPEAKER_00]: some learnings on what's changed over
these several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially us all being here in
Germany, as well as in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: international markets, how we continue to
see trends and a lot of the growth and the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking forward to speaking more on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Susanne Casper.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the CEO of Helinea.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are extractor of plant-based APIs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not a startup like a lot of
companies here in this room.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are in the market for more than 40
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are producing APIs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 2014, we decided to go as well the
route for the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are producing now CBD, CBG,
and THC as isolate and extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, this is my start.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ben?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Benjamin Patok.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not the CEO of Boveda, so I don't fit
in that panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I have to ask for a promotion after
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Boveda or Boveda in Germany,
we are producer of these little brown
[SPEAKER_08]: humidification pouches.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't know them, find us at our
booth.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can have samples.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, you can change your life to the
better.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't know it, so it's a two-way
humidification you can put into any closed
[SPEAKER_08]: container.
[SPEAKER_08]: It will regulate the relative humidity to
an exact level.
[SPEAKER_08]: Regardless of the surrounding conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do this for 25 years, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're not a startup either.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we do this in a multitude of
industries.
[SPEAKER_08]: We started in tobacco industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis today is our biggest industry,
the most fun one, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we also sell to people who breed
alligators.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we sold some to the UN, who ship
larva, eggs to Africa.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything that needs to be stored at
exact humidity conditions.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to be on this panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I definitely use those packages to
keep my cannabis fresh back in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my name is Alex Revich.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been helping start this ICBC in 2017.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing how far this has come.
[SPEAKER_05]: And back home, my day job, when I'm not
helping organize ICBC and moderating
[SPEAKER_05]: panels, I have a company called Loosh
Brands, where we make edibles,
[SPEAKER_05]: contract manufacturer of edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have a pharmacy called Hybrid Farmed
as Medical Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So very nice to be here with you all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick round of applause.
[SPEAKER_05]: Applause for our panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to start.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking backstage with Paul about
the background of this topic and why it's
[SPEAKER_05]: so important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't we kind of start it off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And each one of us will talk about why
there's such an important topic and why
[SPEAKER_05]: these people should care about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's some interesting parallels
when we look at the Australian market,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is our core market to the German
market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think in Australia, we've now got
700 flowers.
[SPEAKER_09]: products in the market.
[SPEAKER_09]: So heavily commoditized market at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the last 12 weeks, we had 58 new
products in the high THC category in the
[SPEAKER_09]: last 12 weeks in the Australian market.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was thinking and hoping that we may
have hit an inflection point last year,
[SPEAKER_09]: but it seems that's not the case in our
home market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I talked to our partners here in
Germany, we were hearing exactly the same
[SPEAKER_09]: thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So by definition of commoditization,
we're going from high value high quality
[SPEAKER_09]: products or more niche products into
generics, really, if we're talking in
[SPEAKER_09]: farmer land.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we accept as a company that
that's the markets that we're playing in.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the markets we see across the
globe, across the markets we work in,
[SPEAKER_09]: in say, France and Poland, as an example.
[SPEAKER_09]: But certainly when we look at Germany and
Australia, the theory of commoditization
[SPEAKER_09]: is prevalent.
[SPEAKER_09]: For us, it's got positive and negatives on
a positive sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can see in Australia, there's been a
real shift to accessibility.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when we spoke about medical cannabis
in Australia, five or six years ago,
[SPEAKER_09]: the problem, it was patient advocates
saying that we need access and it's too
[SPEAKER_09]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: But now we can see that trend really,
really shifting.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the cost for a patient has now dropped
significantly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in our market, we're dealing with
patients and it's a last resort for people
[SPEAKER_09]: with chronic health needs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those patients often cannot work full
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, there's a real positive
behind the commoditization.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we're also seeing a shift from
the black market in Australia.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a survey that's run in Australia
every four years that asks some
[SPEAKER_09]: interesting questions around drug use in a
very non-de-identified way to Australian
[SPEAKER_09]: public.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in 2019, they asked the question,
they said, for those people that are using
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis illicitly, patients using illicit
cannabis for a medical reason,
[SPEAKER_09]: what percentage of those patients actually
got a script through our medical
[SPEAKER_09]: framework?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was 1.8% in 2019.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in 2023, just the back half of last
year, it's up to 22%.
[SPEAKER_09]: So on another positive frame, we're
shifting away from the black market to the
[SPEAKER_09]: legal market.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think commoditization has driven prices
down, which means that less black market
[SPEAKER_09]: activity, more medical activity.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think ultimately in Australia,
it'd be no different to Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: There'll be a shift from commoditization
to lower price product legalization.
[SPEAKER_09]: In my personal opinion, that's where we're
heading.
[SPEAKER_09]: And very similar parallels to what we're
seeing here in Germany, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I could jump right in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you look at the flower price in
Germany, I mean, there are now websites
[SPEAKER_08]: where you can check flower price in
pharmacies for the same strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, like the entry point is as
low as three euro for a gram of flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I talked to many, because we work with
many of the importers, some of the
[SPEAKER_08]: producers as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they really see also like a spike just
in like all the new stuff that's coming
[SPEAKER_08]: in, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So the proportion of products that they
bring in that needs to be, everybody in
[SPEAKER_08]: the beginning was like, oh, we need stable
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like stable, stable, stable.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not so much that thing, because they
really see new stuff coming in,
[SPEAKER_08]: big sales, and then it kind of like fades
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next thing comes in, new sales.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a consumer model market,
even though we're in the medical field
[SPEAKER_00]: technically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Atlas Global Brands, we export to seven
international markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exactly that, Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, there's so much changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, me coming from CPG and Jack
Daniels and Dr. Pepper, it comes down to
[SPEAKER_00]: portfolio management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is commoditization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think at the end of the day,
how do you differentiate yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you create the brand positioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the fundamentals, as we look at
it, to really create a differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, at Atlas, we create a,
we have a nursery program, and we
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we make sure we have the best
genetics, so that on sites like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: our partners, we're here in Germany,
and one of our partners, like Inua,
[SPEAKER_00]: has an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You partner with them, and you create a
compelling proposition where it's the only
[SPEAKER_00]: unique cultivar, and it's not a me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moment you have a me too, it's
commoditized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're driven on price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you create a positioning with
your brand, whether medical or consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, let's face it, it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a market in for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something that everyone's looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really an evolving space that
we'll see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to highlight that this market
is not only a flower market.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're only speaking about flower,
but we are speaking about patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are speaking about medical market,
and there are a lot of people who don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore, I think we should see the
market as well, that there are extracts,
[SPEAKER_03]: that there are isolate, that there are
maybe finished products at the end in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's important, the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant for me is so powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really believe we have a lot of
indication where we don't have any chance
[SPEAKER_03]: to find a product so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that cannabis is the plant
who can deliver new medication for new
[SPEAKER_03]: indication.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are working together with the
universities and together with our
[SPEAKER_03]: clients.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are doing clinical studies,
and I really hope for the future for
[SPEAKER_03]: patients who will have this plant will be
so powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Suzanne, what's your view on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because let's talk about the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think a lot of us have a lot of
thoughts around the cannabis health
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think of topical rubs like the
A535s of the world, you think of even
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, the big tobacco and pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very important input.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of, to your
point, different ways to utilize a product
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond combustibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the market will change a little
bit in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there was yesterday as well a
discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in future there will be maybe big
pharma.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know big tobacco companies are looking
as well into this field.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will develop finished products with
clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a lot of products can no longer
be prescribed in the medical market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then there are finished product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as soon as there are finished product
registered by the local authorities,
[SPEAKER_03]: then the market will change completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we are going into this
direction with this, and this maybe you
[SPEAKER_03]: said positive, negative.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with this law change, maybe in
Germany, it's maybe easier to get access
[SPEAKER_03]: to the medical market in that way that
companies will think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, now maybe I invest because it's no
longer a drug product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm no longer in this corner which is more
cannabis, it's not so positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I have the impression that more
companies are thinking about to develop a
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this can take five more years because
in this market you always need to do
[SPEAKER_03]: clinical trials and get a registration.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it will come and then the market will
change totally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, I double that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So at the end, if we're really honest,
right now we're using cannabis flower in a
[SPEAKER_08]: medicinal context.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the lack of better alternative.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we give them like all of the 500
biochemical compounds that are in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we don't know which 5,
25, 135 you need for your specific case,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But at some point we were able to decipher
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this would be made into an application
at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think it'd be interesting to
Bernie understand your perspective on
[SPEAKER_09]: commoditization, legalization,
and what happened next year.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think what we see both here in
Germany and Australia is in some ways the
[SPEAKER_09]: negative side is actually quite
disappointing because there is a
[SPEAKER_09]: conversation around flower and it's high
THC flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the doctor, it's not the
companies like ours making those
[SPEAKER_09]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the patient walking in to the doctor
with a seven minute telehealth consult,
[SPEAKER_09]: even less maybe, saying I want this high
THC flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're reacting and the market's
reacting and it's responding to what the
[SPEAKER_09]: market wants.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is an inevitable step from
commoditization, legalization,
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's the way the market's heading.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, there's definitely some
negatives to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not, as an industry, we're not
doubling down and investing on unique drug
[SPEAKER_09]: delivery.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not looking at new formulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not, we're reacting to a market and
we're all in a really difficult capital
[SPEAKER_09]: market.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no, that might be a little bit
different over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe there's a bit of optimism around the
changes that we've seen and some capital
[SPEAKER_09]: available, but not in our world.
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably limited in your part of the world
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're reacting to the market.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're chasing revenue quarter by quarter,
chasing profitability as a business.
[SPEAKER_09]: So inevitably the downside is that there
is a lack of innovation for real patients
[SPEAKER_09]: with real product solutions,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting point, Paul,
cause I think, you know, that's where we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to all really collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is that time where,
you know, we got to take learnings from
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada and other markets where,
you know, we've made mistakes and take
[SPEAKER_00]: those best practices and adapt them over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you think about the product
portfolio, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's chasing quarter to quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to find sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a lean organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think at the end of the day,
when we think of what we all do together
[SPEAKER_00]: and the shift towards pharma and
consumerism is, you know, I come back to
[SPEAKER_00]: even at Atlas, it's like, what are we
great at, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of us have to find our lane that
we want to own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in our case, it's really
being a hub and exporting UGMP for our
[SPEAKER_00]: partners in these types of markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that I think is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you want to try to do everything,
you end up not really being an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I think the value chain
breaks down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage you all to think about
that because, you know, whether it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the conversations we're having today
around, you know, consumerism and pharma
[SPEAKER_00]: and medical, let's just think about those
key pieces because the commoditization is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's make sure whatever lane you pick,
you're very, very efficient at it and
[SPEAKER_00]: productive at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to come back to what Benjamin
just said here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there are trends and I think this is
maybe a lesson we haven't learned here in
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are trends that you can get now a
prescription for one euro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are doing advertisement with a
rep power in a pharmaceutical company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think this is too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, we had a long fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have seen what was going on in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a long fight and there are
parties, they don't like this law.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they directly say within the next
year, we will bring everything back to the
[SPEAKER_03]: status as today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with these advertisement, I think this
is not helping the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really have the fear that now maybe
politicians say, no, this is not what we
[SPEAKER_03]: want for Germany or that pharma insurance
companies maybe say, if this is the
[SPEAKER_03]: market, we will no longer pay for the
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually saw that in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: and what happens is if you kind of make
medical a joke, kind of with your dollar
[SPEAKER_05]: joint, dollar gram, what happens is when
recreational will happen eventually,
[SPEAKER_05]: you'll start to see recreational people go
to recreational and the medical people
[SPEAKER_05]: will actually be professional and medical.
[SPEAKER_05]: And until you have legalization,
unfortunately, this is what's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw that in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw that in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And something else we're seeing in Canada
where you said about people just want to,
[SPEAKER_05]: how high can I get for the cheapest price?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was a very common thing we saw in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Paul, you were talking about like all
these new products.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Ontario, my province, we have 3,000
products in the market and they're talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about increasing it to 5,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bernie's nodding his head.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knows how difficult the Canadian market
is with so many different products,
[SPEAKER_05]: but at least we're diversifying from
flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always say that when the prices come
down and the access increases,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's when you'll get rid of the black
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't get rid of the black market by
policing.
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter how much you try, it won't go
away.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way it'll go away is by giving
the people what they want at the right
[SPEAKER_05]: price and an easy way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that in mind and bringing the
price down, it becomes a commodity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a very important topic that
we're talking about here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Susan, before we get into our next
topic, you wanted to say something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you're discussing price, but what we
can see is that products in the market,
[SPEAKER_03]: the quality is very low.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really, you see especially flowers,
but as well in our area, the EXOF area,
[SPEAKER_03]: the product quality is so low that let's
say we know there will be, there are
[SPEAKER_03]: products in the market, let's say CBD,
5%.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we analyze this, there is sometimes
there is no CBD inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a THC above the level,
so there are products in the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're false labels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally false, and because nobody is
controlling the market so far,
[SPEAKER_03]: and as well for flowers, the flowers are
sometimes really, really bad quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so pricing is one thing, but if you
want to get good quality price,
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes needs to be as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the price value relationship,
like you said, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say, I give credit to the EU
here and Australia's, it wasn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada where it was like grow it and sell
it, and it's gonna move in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we had legalization, I find the
product quality curve has shot up
[SPEAKER_00]: exponentially, and I'm sure you agree as
well here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right on some of the quality
dumping and commoditization that's
[SPEAKER_00]: shifting some of the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, patients are smart,
and we're all consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you buy at once, if it doesn't meet
your price value relationship,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not gonna deliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it comes back to consistency
and quality of what you wanna deliver and
[SPEAKER_00]: own and be great at, and just consistently
do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll tell your friends about that
it's not good, and that word of mouth is
[SPEAKER_05]: very valuable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ben, you wanted to say something?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but that's a consumer mechanism,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you think of, if it was a
pharmaceutical product, the quality would
[SPEAKER_08]: be the effect that it has on your back
pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the issue is also because
right now in medicinal, we only look at
[SPEAKER_08]: THCBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the only two active compounds that
we really care about, and we don't know
[SPEAKER_08]: about the rest yet, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is, I think, one of the issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all the mechanisms that we see,
this is consumer market mechanisms,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because at the end is, well, if I can get
a medicine, what's the quality of the
[SPEAKER_08]: medicine?
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it help me or not?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not about how does it taste and all
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, of course, there is the adherence
part of it, of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's too bitter, your cough syrup is
too bitter, you won't take it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's bad for you, okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the rest of it is just pure and out
between the strains, the cultivars.
[SPEAKER_08]: I exchange it because I like the flavor
better.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of it has to do with humidity,
actually, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a study of 1,100 data points,
and the legal limit was 10% moisture
[SPEAKER_08]: content.
[SPEAKER_08]: The average was seven, somewhere in at
four.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's really low.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's dry.
[SPEAKER_08]: That stuff is bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the end, it will be interesting to
see how that then translates into
[SPEAKER_08]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with you, Alex.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's how you get, that's right
now that you see a rush into the medicinal
[SPEAKER_08]: because of the lack of a recreational
alternative, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can see that for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul, last stop before we get into our
next topic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I actually just have a question
probably, Bernie and Alex, for you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I realize that I'm interested in that I
think other people in the audience might
[SPEAKER_09]: step beyond commoditization, legalization.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there some good examples out there in
US and Canada that you will guide
[SPEAKER_09]: companies like ours or startups or
whatever that looks like in Australia and
[SPEAKER_09]: Germany?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good example, I don't know, Bernie,
good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, I see it to everyone is
like, you can never, whether it's medical
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis is in medical spaces,
you can never trick the consumer or the
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Deliver on what you want to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's been in our space,
even in the early time is you think,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, just get it out the door,
get it out the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just the consistency,
the quality, the price value relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you highlight the humidity and
quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this stuff comes in handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always use the analogy of the five
senses with cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you open it and you see it and you
touch it, you smell it, you taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ultimately evolves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the key learnings is just what
you put in the bag is if you were to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: any product off that market, would you be
proud of its consistency?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it comes down to that for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is if the consumer or patient
always see the quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes maybe they think, oh,
it could help for this disease or for this
[SPEAKER_03]: pain or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And oh, it doesn't help.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, cannabis is not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will tell this to my colleagues.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it can really reduce the market because
if the quality is not there, if the
[SPEAKER_03]: product is not inside what they are
selling, putting on the package,
[SPEAKER_03]: then this can ruin the full market because
then people are thinking, okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is nothing for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we have done a big,
big step ahead in the European Union
[SPEAKER_03]: because there was a creation of a
monograph.
[SPEAKER_03]: This year for the CBD isolator.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is perfect for patients,
for the quality, because now we have a
[SPEAKER_03]: monograph and every product in this market
and everybody, every pharmacy who needs to
[SPEAKER_03]: formulate with the isolate of CBD now
needs to follow this regulation,
[SPEAKER_03]: this specification.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this will be perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of products will need to get out
of the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think everybody who would like to
think about, oh, I will develop a product
[SPEAKER_03]: and do stability data, they really now
need to think about which product to start
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_03]: This need to comply to this monograph.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a step ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this will follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is not only good for Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think as well other authorities will
follow the example.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to really take it,
doctors to take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been doing a lot of doctor education
throughout my career, 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the beginning, they said there's
not enough information.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not enough evidence.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no monograph.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I heard that all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fact that it does have it will
really help in its credibility.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you were kind of asking the question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the big parts and the
challenges around our industry is within
[SPEAKER_05]: the regulations, there's a lot of expenses
in being a legal company, EU, GMP,
[SPEAKER_05]: all these costs with these costs require
investment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you take investment on and then the
clock starts ticking of you got to start
[SPEAKER_05]: paying the back of that investment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're really rushing to try and be
able to survive long enough until you can
[SPEAKER_05]: give the customers what they want and the
patients what they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that kind of goes into our next topic
around the commoditization of this
[SPEAKER_05]: product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's good and bad with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the patient might get a cheaper,
more affordable product.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then how do we make our money back to
pay back the investors?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if the investors aren't
interested, they're going to go put their
[SPEAKER_05]: money in something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can't even operate these
businesses because it's so expensive to
[SPEAKER_05]: operate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So commodity, the good and the bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Paul, you had some thoughts on it
and some others as well backstage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give the audience some pros and cons of
what this looks like commoditizing this
[SPEAKER_05]: product.
[SPEAKER_09]: I probably touched on a few already,
but one to add might be just you sort of
[SPEAKER_09]: touched on it around how business can
operate in that space.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think with commoditization,
we've got proliferation of brands and
[SPEAKER_09]: businesses and new startups every week by
the sound of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the Australian example, it's very easy
to bring a product and put a label on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it does make it incredibly difficult to
operate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a different layer of thinking for
businesses.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we as a company have started from
a pure farmer perspective because that was
[SPEAKER_09]: the environment in which we operated.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we still continue to operate in that
environment.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we've had to start to think more FMCG
as an industry, as a company.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, that's a different commercial
proposition for us as a business and our
[SPEAKER_09]: strategy and our shareholders.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we're seeing, we probably
haven't seen it too much over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there may be some different views,
but certainly in Australia, we're seeing
[SPEAKER_09]: companies not being able to operate in
that space because it relies on volume,
[SPEAKER_09]: it relies on margin, it relies on
branding, it relies on obviously good
[SPEAKER_09]: quality product to the patient.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, on the negative side,
it's difficult to operate in that space.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we all in this industry should think
what's right for the patient.
[SPEAKER_09]: And ultimately, I still think on the
balance of positive and negative that
[SPEAKER_09]: there's some real positives behind access
for patients and affordability for
[SPEAKER_09]: patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: So overall, I think that we're trending in
the right direction.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do hope that there's a future where
there's a bit of a carve out for,
[SPEAKER_09]: in our part of the world, there's
legalization that medical continues to
[SPEAKER_09]: have a space.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think that the medical part and
what we were previously delivering and
[SPEAKER_09]: thinking about was producing unique
products.
[SPEAKER_09]: And drugs, thinking about drug
registration, thinking about solving real
[SPEAKER_09]: patient problems.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a different strategic thinking in
a boardroom when you look at both of
[SPEAKER_09]: those.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do hope that there's a future world
that there is a split between legalized
[SPEAKER_09]: pathway, medical pathway, and that the
medical pathway has the right investment
[SPEAKER_09]: to invest in research and development and
really focus on those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Medical is one side, very pharma.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's CPG, which is very
different, something that Bernie knows a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very different worlds for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some other thoughts on the good and bad of
commodity housing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Our product is a commodity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know what our biggest competitor is
in the cannabis space?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually people using nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: They just know that dry weed sucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They still smoke it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in other places, in the cigar space
where we originated from 25 years,
[SPEAKER_08]: our biggest competitor is basically a
sponge.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a highly commoditized business.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the end of a day is, and that's
like for every consumer market is,
[SPEAKER_08]: you have to build your selling proposition
and your brand in order to convince people
[SPEAKER_08]: that you have the right solution for what
they need.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are the most expensive solution in
the market.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we are also the best solution in the
market when it comes to delivering on
[SPEAKER_08]: point.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's IP protected.
[SPEAKER_08]: So everybody else, we created this product
industry, really.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've seen in the last 25 years a lot
of MeToo products.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're here at the show as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the last 25 years, we've seen a lot
of them come and go.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my question would be for you
guys, how easy would it be for you to
[SPEAKER_08]: pivot?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because flour could be a recreational
product.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for how easy would it be for you to
pivot?
[SPEAKER_08]: For you, it would be a little bit more
difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in theory, there's a way either in each
industry for you guys at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I find the biggest change,
if you think about Canada, we were medical
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we shifted to Canadian
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the thing that we've got to
think about is there's the rapid growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: the macro industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The behaviors of our patients and what
they expect and what they want from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis has always been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you've got to remember, yes,
we're creating some products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're also converting the illicit
market over to medical for consistency and
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the thing when I think
about brands and whether it's on the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yes, you've got the traditional
pharma, the API, the Apotex is when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada and whatnot, and other large
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, the key thing that I see here
is you can still brand and you can still
[SPEAKER_00]: create a brand affinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does that product deliver?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think consumers in the medical space
and patients, they'll continue to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: and have expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's portfolio building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's understanding how each one of the
pieces segment to your actual patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think are very, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, a lot of it's from FMCG.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even in a lot of the partners I've
worked with in the past in the pharma side
[SPEAKER_00]: is like, what's the solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the innovation you're delivering?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the need state you're meeting?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you nail that every single time,
you're going to have a patient base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, there's commoditization and on me
too, but it's those are going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to balance the volume, the quality,
the price value relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, that product that the
consumer and patient wants is going to win
[SPEAKER_00]: every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Susan, I know you have an interesting
perspective here because actually this
[SPEAKER_05]: commoditization might actually be a
benefit for you because you have a product
[SPEAKER_05]: that creates standardization and quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't require growing maybe with
the same type of cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe this commoditization could be
good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, think about some questions
from the audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Susan will give her answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if anyone has any questions,
we'll take them there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Susan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like come back to your question.
[SPEAKER_03]: People need to earn money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe investors are no longer willing
to spend their money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have the feeling the industry is
changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of companies start to leave the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe there will be more companies
leaving the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And quality and what we said,
standardization, it's not cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really need to have the money to do
stability data.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have stability data for five years,
but this is an investment of hundreds of
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of euro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe a lot of companies will
leave the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore, if you really think to
start to do something in the long run,
[SPEAKER_03]: you need to see which company will be in
the market in the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we saw that in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many companies started.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now every year, we have more companies
leaving than joining.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the big things on
commoditization is the marketing
[SPEAKER_05]: restrictions really make it difficult for
us to differentiate ourselves from
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do you separate?
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, customers only really understand
THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to really create a more
knowledgeable customer and allow for some
[SPEAKER_05]: education around products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not marketing, obviously.
[SPEAKER_05]: Advertising is not going to be allowed
ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But finding other ways to educate people
on why your product is better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's going to be a way to
differentiate yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know, Ben, you look like you
have a thought there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to finish that, you're right.
[SPEAKER_08]: At the end of the day, the good thing
about commoditization is the consumer has
[SPEAKER_08]: now a choice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if that choice is, I want to sacrifice
quality over price, that's the choice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the challenge is, of course,
as you said, where do you fit in in all
[SPEAKER_08]: that entire spectrum?
[SPEAKER_08]: That is, how do you make yourself stand
out and explain why your product is worth
[SPEAKER_05]: what you ask for?
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, you're just a commodity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're compared equally to
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then people want to know what's the
best price on that commodity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions from the audience?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a few other questions here for the
panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wanted to open it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anyone has any questions first,
I see one right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a good group up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I'm from Russia, Yuri, and I plan
hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before in Russia, hemp used only for fiber
and for seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I here find out that CBD is very
popular in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of advantage we are talking
about CBD here.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC I don't touch at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if anybody think how CBD destroys the
body in future, nobody talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: disadvantage of CBD, if any disadvantage
that you declare.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you saying that you've heard there's
some disadvantages of CBD?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can speak to one in my pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do med checks there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found that certain blood thinners,
if you take CBD, it makes the blood
[SPEAKER_05]: thinner and less effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I always tell people we don't really
say that CBD is completely safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does have some negative things,
especially for people on certain
[SPEAKER_05]: medications.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the other negative with CBD is
what carrier oil it's mixed with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people with MCT oil or coconut oil
can cause diarrhea.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it makes stomach upset.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not the CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's more the carrier oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anyone else on the panel
has any kind of thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, you see this is maybe this is
not commodity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, this is a product that works
like any other pharmaceutical ingredient.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, it's a pharmaceutical
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I take something, sometimes you
have some negative output.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I need to say our products,
we are delivering to Brazil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Brazil, the CBD is given to
children with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it works so good and so effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that maybe this is not, oh,
I like to have this only to feel a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit better.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you should see it like a product that
really works, that really helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe you should not take it only for
fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you need to... Nothing fun about
CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, maybe one negative I want to say
about CBD that's very bothering me is in
[SPEAKER_05]: the US and other places, how it's like a
novelty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go to the US and they put it in
hamburgers and tampons.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're putting CBD in everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's become more of like a novelty
than a real medical product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that really bothers me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's probably the biggest negative
of CBD is because it's legal in these
[SPEAKER_05]: jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_05]: People have kind of put them in funny
shaped gummies and, oh, buy your CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, no, this is not what it's
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoking CBD is probably literally the
worst way of getting your CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just one more to add from my
perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've supplied, I think, over 70,000 units
of our CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: 50 oil in an MCT carrier to the French
pilot study.
[SPEAKER_09]: And under that study, we're measuring
pharmacovigilance.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to do that through the French
regime.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was no serious, over that three
year period, there was no serious
[SPEAKER_09]: incidents.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there is quite a few on record of
minor incidents, which I think Alex has
[SPEAKER_09]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_09]: So diarrhea, vomiting, but again,
often linked to the carrier oil,
[SPEAKER_09]: but nothing major that we've seen in that
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, very interested to see what's
happening in Russia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't hear too much about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I love seeing new countries come to
ICBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hey, you're the first Russian I meet
here at ICBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, we'll have a chance to chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to learn more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions right here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question for Bernie.
[SPEAKER_04]: You briefly mentioned working before for
brands like Jack Daniels and Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of similarities between
that and the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you say are the biggest
difference between those kinds of brands
[SPEAKER_04]: and products and the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we definitely, and that's a great
question, we definitely forget how long it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes to build a brand and trust with
patients and consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Jack Daniels has 160, 170 years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's synonymous with whiskey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very challenging, I find,
building brands in this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's really the step by step.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Alex mentioned it too around,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You upset one consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ripple effect of Reddit and all of
that, it's the implication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of why when we all look
together, it's changed so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in this space now for seven plus
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I say now is we need to find our
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be real honest with each other
and say, again, what are we great at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work together and build and shape
the industry now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what we're seeing a lot
of even here at the ICBC when I talked to
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, how do we do this better?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we have a consistent global
supply chain?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about CBG like, let's talk about
McDonald's, the french fry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's here, Canada, China,
wherever, it's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what all of us want to
get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really just got to be thoughtful on
that approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question relates to what a consistent
and successful consumer product regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: must offer to companies in order to make
it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think an impression that a lot
of people in Germany have is that the
[SPEAKER_01]: market dynamic of bringing in new products
that deflate rather quickly, and companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that have an ultra high cash burn rate who
are, who must make this kind of money to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep up with this circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis and or THC as an ingredient
is the actual interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Assuming it follows the same logic as
tobacco where we're getting away from
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco products and more towards a
nicotine based regulation and different
[SPEAKER_01]: forms of consumption that must be the goal
in my personal opinion for cannabis to be
[SPEAKER_01]: successful in the long run and achieve
high revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Per unit sales that are sustainable
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can regulators enable industry and set
them up for success and at some point
[SPEAKER_01]: drawing from lessons from Canada which
probably don't need to be replicated in
[SPEAKER_01]: other parts of the world to at the same
time open a market but also protect it
[SPEAKER_01]: from the dynamics that makes it eat itself
or destroy itself in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ask this panel because that's an
interesting question because there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretical view right and there's a
practical view and you said it too cash
[SPEAKER_00]: burn managing your day-to-day operations
and whatnot is it's really finding the
[SPEAKER_00]: right mix of the portfolio I find like
let's face it in the next near term you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to sell flower like you can talk about
the API very important and there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium and the long run development but if
you want to survive and sustain like even
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada today you got you know in a more
mature market where there's 2.0 products
[SPEAKER_00]: can't you know flowers just under 50% of
all the volume still right now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-rolls and that's and then plus
pre-rolls on top with the 18% like so when
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at it there's a lot of those
pieces but where I want to get to is
[SPEAKER_00]: really around the balance of yes there's a
long term and helping making sure we're
[SPEAKER_00]: all contributing as a group shaping the
space and making this a really long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable market on the global front and
I think there's a lot of pieces that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to run but you know that's a probably
a separate topic that that can have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of dialogue I'm interested in everyone's
view because you want to build it but you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to keep the lights on and you got to
balance that and that's a tricky balance
[SPEAKER_05]: for sure we can definitely talk about it
for a while I see on Gaio over here looks
[SPEAKER_05]: like maybe our our time is our time is up
yeah our panel was fantastic let's hear it
[SPEAKER_07]: again Alex Revich Bernie Young Suzanne
Caspar and Benjamin Potok well that was
[SPEAKER_07]: wonderful that was fantastic and I'm sure
you can talk to them in the hallway if
[SPEAKER_07]: you'd like to talk to them some more
