[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few people, rare politicians,
that actually fight for these freedoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our next keynote speaker is someone
who fights for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Liberty.
[SPEAKER_03]: To have fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's hurting anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So without further ado, I would like to
bring to the stage the great one,
[SPEAKER_03]: the man who helped end the Cold War and
the man who has helped end the drug war,
[SPEAKER_03]: the number one ally in Congress for
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please give a warm Schweitzer welcome to
Dana Warbacher, everybody.
I
[SPEAKER_01]: would really love to have introductions
like that.
Can I take you with me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much for having me be
with you this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is quite inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started discussing the cannabis
issue, we would never be in residence like
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would be off in the woods someplace
doing the paperwork that was necessary for
[SPEAKER_01]: such a discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this cannabis now has reached a new
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we need to talk about and
understand, that it is not the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that was around when I was a
teenager.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll talk a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also know that I was in Congress for
30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in Reagan White House for seven
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was President Reagan's senior
speechwriter and a special assistant to
[SPEAKER_01]: the president.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I ran for Congress for 30 years.
I've been in the house.
And after all of that time in public
service, people ask, well, what's it like
and what do you feel now that it's all
over?
And you look back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a story, and Ronald Reagan always
told me, well, Dana, make sure that you
[SPEAKER_01]: always start off with a little funny
story.
And there is a story that Reagan liked to
tell about a fellow who, when he was
younger, had a gang of friends that they
hung around with all the time.
And as they got older, most of them didn't
succeed as much as one of them did.
One of them just made millions.
Millions and millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he got to be about 50 or 60 years
old, he decided to get the old gang back.
And he invited the old gang to his
mansion.
And they were in the backyard.
And he said, I'm going to show you fellas
something I've probably never seen.
This is a swimming pool.
And they pushed a button.
And all of a sudden, the lawn started to
part.
And there was a swimming pool.
Right underneath the turf.
Beautiful swimming pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except it was filled with crocodiles,
alligators, sharks, piranhas.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a horror story.
And they're looking at all of these fish
going after each other, going after
whatever.
We had the water.
And the guy who owned the place said to
his old gang, you know, I'm willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: give $250,000 to any one of you or every
one of you who will swim across this pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in order to succeed, you've got to
take risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no one jumped in the pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think anybody would be foolish
enough to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on over, grab a little barbecue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as they walked toward the barbecue,
he heard a splash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he looks around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a guy in the pool.
He's beating away the crocodiles.
There's a shark coming up.
And he hits it on the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: He swims across the pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as he's getting out of that swimming
pool, the man runs over to him and says,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you want me to give you the money?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, I don't care about the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know who pushed me in that pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that I'm done with my
congressional career, I sort of feel who
[SPEAKER_01]: pushed me in that pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you know, no one said democracy
was going to be easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one said that just because you
believe in what you believe and that
you're honest and sincere about it,
which I've tried to be in my career,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you were going to succeed or that you
will be remembered for the good things you
[SPEAKER_01]: did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because quite often in the way that
humankind is, they remember the bad things
[SPEAKER_01]: are the mistakes that one makes rather
than the accomplishments.
Well, I'm very proud, no matter whether
they're recognized or not, I'm very proud
to have played a role, yes, in ending the
Cold War.
But also, I'm very proud of the fact that
I played a major role in ending the war on
cannabis especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for you folks today, I wore a special
shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not have noticed last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wore my?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is Elephants in the Weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was given to me by an immigrant from
Ethiopia who is my surfing partner in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's only a few black surfers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to let you know, that is my
sport.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a surfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been a surfer for many,
many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to give you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surfers, in order to catch the wave,
you don't look to the inside wave.
You don't look at what's breaking right
now.
But you look to the outside wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you position yourself so where
you can get the maximum ride on that wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we have to do now is understand
that there's a wave coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's on the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think that right now that the
cannabis industry oh my goodness,
[SPEAKER_01]: look at what it is today compared to what
it was just a few years ago.
And it was only about five or six years
ago that my amendment finally passed in
the Senate and went to it, or in the
House.
And then it was written in the law in the
Senate and the President.
Only about five or six years ago.
That was, you know, that's right now.
But on the outside, there is a wave,
a cannabis wave about to hit the world
economy.
And you represent that wave that's coming.
Because for far too long, for a hundred
years, cannabis was suppressed as a
benefit to mankind.
That for a hundred years, what could have
been used in a number of ways to help
human beings was denied them by various
forces in our societies.
So with that, that's all changing now.
And we have to prepare for that.
Those who are prepared will make a profit.
Those who are prepared will be able to do
the most good.
And there will be, however, a lot of
changes in the cannabis industry as
[SPEAKER_01]: compared, as I say, to what it was when it
was underground and when it was not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, let me just say my chief
motive in getting involved with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: was the same motive I had in fighting
communism earlier in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, this is a freedom issue to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people... I know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that, and I said, at times
when he gives me a speech, I go,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's what we're all about,
freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people go, freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody was mentioning that to me,
and they were at one of my presentations,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was saying, freedom.
And I couldn't help but think,
I think it's a little bit nicer than
yelling, weed, weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit more sophisticated to
call for freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we are experiencing now is a
revelation to so many people that the
[SPEAKER_01]: suppression that we've had has had a
tremendous cost on society.
And first of all, let us just note,
we have been financing gangsters and drug
dealers who are the worst of the lot for
the last 50 to 100 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when prohibition ended for
alcohol, the gangsters were finally cut
[SPEAKER_01]: off from their source of revenue and had
to go to some other business.
Well, what we have, because of the
illegality, we have created a gangster
system in the world.
You are the ones who are gonna break that
gangster system.
You are the ones who are going to make
sure that what we have is a product that
is safe, a product that when you sell it
to someone, after what you have done,
they know what they're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: After, and they will know exactly how much
they are taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will know whether or not there are
dangerous things to be as part of that
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are going to be the ones that are
providing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, making sure that
with some of the worst anti-societal
[SPEAKER_01]: elements in the world, these gangsters are
coming off from their source of funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is really a tremendous time to be
alive and to be in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have no doubt that in the future
that we're going to make sure that people
[SPEAKER_01]: understand and they will understand just
what that means to their lives after
they've been told that marijuana and
cannabis is some sort of really horrible
thing that needs to be stamped out.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I told you I was a surfer,
I really am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had trouble with surfers now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people only see these wonderful,
beautiful bodies on their surfboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surfing is really hard on your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you get to be 71 years old
as I am right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all comes back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're paying a price for those moments of
ecstasy on that wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's happened is I get metal
shoulders in my arms now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I surfed away all the cartilage in my arms
because it was all like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also I've got arthritis in my neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been a cannabis advocate for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was mentioning this pain that I have
now in my neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some guy says, hey, Dana, why don't
you use this CBD cream that we've got?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an addict.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I said, okay, I want you to know
that this was only about two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had this horrible arthritis in my
neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I finally reached in and put it in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know that the pain stopped for
three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just put a little more cream on
and the pain came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is wonderful for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, of course, we have to
ask ourselves, why the hell have we
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed so many people to sit there in
pain, suffering all of this time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before there was that cannabis cream,
what alternative did they have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they could drink more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what happened, especially in
old folks' homes and senior living
[SPEAKER_01]: centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 10, 20 years ago it was noted that
they're filling up with drunks because
[SPEAKER_01]: they would be drinking too much to deal
with their suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: What making cannabis illegal has done
then, one major thing, making it illegal,
[SPEAKER_01]: made sure that we had people who were
suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, of course, instead of having to
drink to alleviate that suffering or take
[SPEAKER_01]: some other type of drug, they have an
alternative that I believe God created,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis plant, in order to serve
mankind and to help us eliminate that
[SPEAKER_01]: suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to do that and take advantage of
that opportunity, of course, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always, again, if someone does
not want to take advantage of this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to alleviate suffering from
themselves or anyone else, they should be
[SPEAKER_01]: free not to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, people should be free to
make those choices in their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what this has all been about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Republicans, of course, did not think
that way, but let me just note that when
[SPEAKER_01]: we finally got this passed, I've been
trying to get this legalized medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana amendment passed for about 15,
20 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it finally passed, it was because
we came up with the formula, and we just
[SPEAKER_01]: heard how this relates to Switzerland as
well, that with your Canton system is very
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to the state system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Republicans in the United States
have always been talking about the 10th
[SPEAKER_01]: Amendment and states' rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to get the Republican vote
that I needed by simply saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna leave it up to the states,
realizing that the people of the states
[SPEAKER_01]: would make the right decision for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once that passes, as I say,
that's what you see now, beginning to
[SPEAKER_01]: break, but if you look right past what's
going on, what's going out there in the
[SPEAKER_01]: long run, we now have a seismic change in
the nature of Western civilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because this plant does so many
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This plant will provide, look,
you see this, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's just the elephant in the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do you know that this isn't made
out of weed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: My family were all North Dakota farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were very poor farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad left this farm in North Dakota in
order to fight World War II, and he never
[SPEAKER_01]: went back to the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: He stayed in the Marine Corps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was young, I would go and work
on the farm with him on his month off in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Marine Corps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, farming life is really a hard life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're always looking for a crop that
they can use and sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been illegal in the United States
to grow cannabis, to grow this plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: has so much positive to offer,
and it has been illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, however,
here, my grandfather's farm is about 20
[SPEAKER_01]: miles from the Canadian border.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have permitted the Canadians to
import a billion and a half dollars worth
[SPEAKER_01]: of hemp every year, although the farmers
on our side of the border were not
[SPEAKER_01]: permitted to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is the insanity of the type
of regulation and controls we have in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to, quote, protect us from
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we have today,
of course, is we have a recognition by
[SPEAKER_01]: state so many people, at least by the
Republicans, are finally admitting that
[SPEAKER_01]: government isn't there to make the
personal decisions in your life for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we've had this dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Democrats want to control every inch
of people's economic lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think they can do business better
than the small businessman who runs his
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think the government can do better by
giving him the orders of exactly what he
[SPEAKER_01]: can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Republicans think that they can
run your personal life by telling you what
[SPEAKER_01]: to do in your personal life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that what's happening now is
with the state's rights issue,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were able to break down that political
dichotomy which held us right where we
[SPEAKER_01]: were for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just give you a couple of things
about what I expect in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are happy to answer a couple of
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I have enough time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just say this about where people
are coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid, people got put in jail
for smoking marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just having a joint would put you in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the people who were going to jail for
so long in the United States weren't just
[SPEAKER_01]: people like myself, because I at least
came from a upper middle income after my
[SPEAKER_01]: dad got out of the Marine Corps.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got a job in the aerospace industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we lived an upper middle income
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the kids who smoked marijuana back
in my day, if they got arrested,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would go to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within a very short period of time,
their lawyer would emerge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what would happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: The lawyer would say, we've worked a deal
out with the judge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will get away off with a
misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that was forgotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the kids from the black community
or from the Chicanos or lower income,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd be put in jail if they were caught
with a baggie of marijuana in their
[SPEAKER_01]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'd be told, well, first of all,
they'd sit in jail for two or three days
[SPEAKER_01]: before the public defender arrived and
said, you need to plead guilty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to plead guilty, and then they'll
be lenient on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by pleading guilty, they ended up with
a whole generation of young people from
[SPEAKER_01]: the poorer communities who ended up with
criminal records.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, what kind of jobs could
they get?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the overall impact on our society was
horrendous, but nobody could see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The black and Chicano communities
understood it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody else could see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, hopefully, now we are going to
eliminate that type of horrendous result
[SPEAKER_01]: in what was meant, and let's face it,
I believe the people who came in and made
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis illegal in the first place were
doing so because they thought they were
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to help us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no, they were ending up creating
gangsterism, condemning poor people,
[SPEAKER_01]: to a lifetime of unable to get jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were actually destroying our
freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it was all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that said, I am proud to play a
role in coming up with the political
[SPEAKER_01]: formula that broke the logjam and created
a new America and a new world that is just
[SPEAKER_01]: right out there forming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the wave on the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't even seen the impact that this
is going to create yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have safe drugs,
the opiates that now cause so much agony
[SPEAKER_01]: among our people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a way to replace them now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have actually, from what I understand,
that cannabis is a way, a method.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to call it the gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they have to eliminate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we understand it's a gateway,
all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gateway out of drug addiction in
that it can be used to actually get people
[SPEAKER_01]: off an addiction to other drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what a tremendous, exciting adventure
we're about to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm proud to stand with you and the
other people in this world and in my
[SPEAKER_01]: country that really truly believe in
freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that said, if you have any
questions, I think I've got a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, give it up for Dana Rohrbacher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Question, question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's got a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody got a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, here I come.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on my way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congressman, when do you see federal
legalization in the US?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's step by step.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already legalized it to the degree
for medical purposes in the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also now we have the hemp bill,
which is an actual first step towards an
[SPEAKER_01]: actual federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, and this is going to sound
optimistic, but I don't think it is
[SPEAKER_01]: optimistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the way the politics is shaping up
in the United States today, that in some
[SPEAKER_01]: place early next year, because our
Congresses have two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the second year of this Congress,
before the elections start taking place,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will find a consensus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now there's all kinds of ideas out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are putting their they're putting a
bills in the hopper that go for this and
[SPEAKER_01]: different elements of the challenge we
face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that what you'll have is
probably about January or February.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that they'll start organizing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these ideas will start being put
into one bill and there will be a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you will have a
negotiation by something a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: have missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the significance of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm no longer there to play the referee
and to try to get some movement forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I may be gone, but there's another
Republican there who has incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: influence on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Donald Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Donald Trump, I've had a couple of
conversations with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the last election, he made his
position very clear and that he believed
[SPEAKER_01]: that medical use of cannabis should be
should be legal around the whole country
[SPEAKER_01]: and that personal recreational adult use
should be left up to the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he repeated that in public three times
during that election.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a lot of people mistakenly think that
because Trump has such a wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: personality and it gets in the way so
wonderfully gets in.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, President Trump has an abrasive
personality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they mistakenly because they don't
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, remember, I worked for Reagan and
Reagan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was had to be proper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a sense of propriety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, I'll do one thing about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll describe this first.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to understand why that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reagan came from a very poor family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ronald Reagan, literally, they were the
poorest of the poor in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Reagan, in order to have a
self-esteem, he had to make sure he acted
[SPEAKER_01]: in a proper way and he dressed in a proper
way and he talked in a proper way and he
[SPEAKER_01]: told funny stories and and it was likable
in a proper way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Donald Trump didn't have to do any of
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was he came from a very wealthy family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he has a natural tendency to say,
well, I'll try not to use a swear word
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, screw that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and so people look at that as being,
you know, abrasive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't pay it and everybody who hates
Donald Trump is usually you say,
[SPEAKER_01]: why do you hate Donald Trump?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always always because of his
personality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the policies that he is talking
about, I have an agree with those
[SPEAKER_01]: policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the policy that I like the most is the
fact that he is going to be the leader and
[SPEAKER_01]: the lead sled dog in the on the cannabis
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark my words.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will have this coalition formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to surprise everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I tried to be the lead sled
dog on this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what they say was a Norman
Thompson was the lead sled dog has the
[SPEAKER_01]: best view.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the lead sled dog is the one who gets
bitten on the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because your ass is bleeding
doesn't mean you're the lead sled dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm no longer the lead sled dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Trump is going to be and there's and
so more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there will be a new bill
and it will pass and it will go about half
[SPEAKER_01]: the way to what we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it will be a giant step forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I think we're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have one more question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just wondering, you mentioned
that cannabis is the gateway out of other
[SPEAKER_00]: types of addiction or dependence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also see it as a gateway to the end of
the war on drugs in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering what your views on that
are, especially with regards to perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: the dissolution of the Controlled
Substances Act and also on an
[SPEAKER_00]: international level or on the
international level with the 6171 and 88
[SPEAKER_00]: Controlled Substance Conventions,
if you see the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: changing its stance internationally as
well in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I agree with everything you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I am someone with a libertarian
background and I just don't think the
[SPEAKER_01]: government should butt out of our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, leave us alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave the individuals and his business
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just leave us alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that's not the way most people
feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in the United States, where we're so
proud of liberty as being, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, our founding fathers, first of all,
we came from every religion and race in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came there in order to create this
new country based on the principles of
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: They said it right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the principles of life,
liberty, and the pursuit, by the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: it didn't say the pursuit of property,
which is what was popular in those days,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pursuit of happiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is wonderful and I do believe that
that still is the guidepost to Americans
[SPEAKER_01]: who think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most Americans aren't thinking about
it and they just are sort of going along
[SPEAKER_01]: with basic concepts of what's not gonna
disrupt society, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think we're gonna have the type
of liberalization, I wouldn't say
[SPEAKER_01]: liberalization, the liberation that we
would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, let us just note also that we
have had a horrendous situation here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The opiates now, when we're talking about
the opiates, it is a horror story that our
[SPEAKER_01]: government approved the sale of this and
doctors kept prescribing this knowing that
[SPEAKER_01]: these opiates were addictive and harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of legalizing cannabis,
they were willing to do that with people's
[SPEAKER_01]: lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna leave you with one last story
and that is how I realized that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be able to succeed politically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been the front man on this for a
long, long time because I believe in it
[SPEAKER_01]: and I believe, I tried to do when I was in
Congress the things I believe were true
[SPEAKER_01]: and right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that didn't mean that at any moment I
could be unelected because again,
[SPEAKER_01]: the public attitude has to be taken into
consideration with how much leverage that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't know whether or not I was
gonna end up booted out of the Congress
[SPEAKER_01]: probably five, six years ago because I was
about to succeed in a major step forward
[SPEAKER_01]: in liberalizing cannabis restrictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided, I had an appointment in my
office with a person, with a guy who is a
[SPEAKER_01]: resident of my district and I said to
myself, this guy is the quintessential
[SPEAKER_01]: Rerbacher voter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm gonna ask him and find out what he
thinks about the fact that his congressman
[SPEAKER_01]: is leading the fight to legalize cannabis
and legalize medical marijuana and so he
[SPEAKER_01]: came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sat down and we were talking and I
said, gee, I wanna know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually I'm gonna be succeeding in this
effort that I've been working on for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time about medical marijuana because
we're gonna leave it up to the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got the vote figured out and I'm
gonna win this vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you think about the fact that
your congressman is leading the fight to
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize medical marijuana?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, well, Dana, you really don't
know me, do you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, I know that you were in the
Navy and that you were a pilot in the Navy
[SPEAKER_01]: and that you are an officer and that you
now work for a major aerospace firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that and I know you're a
Republican.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, yeah, but you don't really
know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know that I have three sons and
you don't know that the day after 9-11,
[SPEAKER_01]: my three sons joined up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all marched off and signed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what you also don't know is that
a few years later, two of my sons came
[SPEAKER_01]: home, but one of them that came home,
the third son was no longer my son.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was having convulsions every day on the
floor and I could do nothing to save my
[SPEAKER_01]: son.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, and now I don't know how many of
you have children, but I have a son that
[SPEAKER_01]: would break my heart if that was happening
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he said, I couldn't do anything and
I struggled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were taking him to the VA hospital
and they were doing nothing for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, he said, a doctor pulled me
aside, said, see me in my office out in
[SPEAKER_01]: the town around the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did and he said, look, your son
needs medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how to get it and this is how to
use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, you know, my son hasn't had a
convulsion since that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, how do I feel about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I feel about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I'm gonna come over and I'm gonna
give you a big hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this story would be over right here
at this point, but it even gets better,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that, of course, that touched my
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've repeated that story and that man
has become someone who I've kept in touch
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got this call about six months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, well, we got something else
to thank you about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, well, my son, the one that was
having the trouble and still faces a real
[SPEAKER_01]: struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went to the VA hospital and when he was
there, he felt something coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he went down to his car, I guess to
smoke a joint or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, and he says, and the damn
parking lot attendant arrested him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, yeah, he arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today he was brought to court and
that's why I'm calling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, why are you calling me?
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, well, because when it went into
the court, the judge looked at everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, we're looking at this case and
this case is, this young man was
[SPEAKER_01]: possession and utilizing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says here that, okay, and I see
that the case is being brought up by the
[SPEAKER_01]: DEA and the Department of Justice,
DEA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the people doing the
prosecution are part of the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't help but read this position in
this law that was passed that says that no
[SPEAKER_01]: one in the Department of Justice will use
any of these funds in order to supersede a
[SPEAKER_01]: state law that legalizes medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says, I believe this is what we're
calling medical marijuana and I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: you are federal agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this case is thrown out, bang.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the guy immediately went to the
telephone and called me to thank me for
[SPEAKER_01]: helping his son for a second time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look, right now, there are all kinds of
people like that, young man.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of people who were
getting arrested because they had cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: in their pocket and their family didn't
have a way to defend them against
[SPEAKER_01]: unhealthy or over prosecution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we've made some giant steps
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of you are part of the wave that's
forming that's going to reform this whole
[SPEAKER_01]: area of humankind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will be proud that we fought for
freedom and we eliminated suffering and we
[SPEAKER_01]: brought more fairness to the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
