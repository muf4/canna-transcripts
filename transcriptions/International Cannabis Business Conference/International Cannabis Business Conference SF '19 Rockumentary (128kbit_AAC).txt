[SPEAKER_03]: And now, we bring you the producer,
the man without whom none of this would be
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Six countries this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's here for you right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's here for the one, the only,
Alex Rodgers!
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just here at the ICBC in San
Francisco, and it's just really heartening
[SPEAKER_06]: and refreshing to see how the industry's
grown and get this great group of people
[SPEAKER_06]: together with positive vibes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I was telling Alex, I told Alex this
morning that the opening event that they
[SPEAKER_06]: had last night, a VIP cocktail party,
between the cocktail party and the smoke
[SPEAKER_06]: session that was going on outside on the
street, I met so many people that I would
[SPEAKER_06]: not have otherwise met.
[SPEAKER_06]: People were incredibly accessible,
you know, hanging out with retired NBA
[SPEAKER_06]: Hall of Famers, people that are leaders in
the cannabis industry, and people that
[SPEAKER_06]: were new to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: ICBC, the VIP, meet and greet the night
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great networking event.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wonderful to meet other people that
we hold hands with in the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: making new relationships and new business
opportunities, new possibilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, ICBC is a lot of the old school
activists who really love and respect the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and are also kind of making the leap
to become more professional and move with
[SPEAKER_01]: the policy as it's going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think it's nice about what Alex and
team do is gain the right people in the
[SPEAKER_03]: room to have those important
conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very professional, very international
vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that he does one in Berlin,
I used to do one in Barcelona and Vienna.
[SPEAKER_05]: The conferences are really important
because it's a place for folks who are
[SPEAKER_05]: interested in the industry to come here
and find out more about it, but Alex does
[SPEAKER_05]: an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's this altruism in the cannabis
industry that comes out at these ICBC
[SPEAKER_06]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves this industry,
everybody wants to be a part of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not a lot of people know what's going
on on the ground level, and this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: event really opens people's eyes to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're trying to shepherd this industry
into the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it's a lot more fun than being at
sort of the more cut-and-dry corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: events with people who only look at it as
a commodity and don't really enjoy the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and celebrate the plant in the same
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about the love, you know,
it's all about building community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what Alex has done here at the
ICBC is just transformative and ICBC is
[SPEAKER_04]: just an amazing conference.
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't my first and it won't be my
last.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been awesome, we love this place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
