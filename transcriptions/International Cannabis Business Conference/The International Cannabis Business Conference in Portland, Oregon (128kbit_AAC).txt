[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we just had the second Oregon
Medical Marijuana Business Conference here
[SPEAKER_02]: in Eugene, and it's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are gushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, this underground industry is
coming out into the open, and everyone's
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out of the proverbial closet,
so there's about 400 people here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this conference is a great
opportunity to get information that can
[SPEAKER_01]: really help the people in the industry,
as well as networking opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can really help people's business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's really nothing you can't
make from industrial hemp, from biofuels
[SPEAKER_00]: to the homes that you're living in,
to foods we're eating, the clothing on our
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make almost anything out of it,
even plastics.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Jeremy Sackett.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the Chief Science Officer at Cascadia
Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're an analytical laboratory in Bend,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Anthony Johnson, Executive Director of
the Oregon Cannabis Industry Association,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also with New Approach Oregon and the
Medical Marijuana Business Conference,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're here organizing people in the
industry to protect and improve the Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical Marijuana Act, as well as working
to legalize marijuana for all adults.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited to be part of a
conference like this to get like-minded
[SPEAKER_03]: people, professionals, together that are
currently operating within the industry or
[SPEAKER_03]: considering entering the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just couldn't be happier, and it's all
just a big gear up for the International
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Business Conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in Portland, September 13th and 14th.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're at the Oregon Convention Center and
the Portland Ballroom, and we're pulling
[SPEAKER_02]: out the stops for that event, and this is
all a culmination to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone's having a great time
networking their faces off and learning a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
I'll see you next time.
Thank you.
