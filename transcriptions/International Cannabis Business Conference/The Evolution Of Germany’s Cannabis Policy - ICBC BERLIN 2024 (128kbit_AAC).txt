[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to start it off, my man Georg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Georg is going to come up and he's going
to say a few words and then we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have Joko do the keynote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your hands together and welcome right
now the leader of the German Hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to talk to us a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it for Georg Wirtz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Alex asked me to do this speech here,
I was wondering about what to write into
[SPEAKER_00]: this description because we didn't know
what would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just four weeks ago, it might have
happened that I'm standing here and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, we were close to make a very big
step here in Germany, but well,
[SPEAKER_00]: the second parliament, the Bundesrat
decided to postpone the whole thing for
[SPEAKER_00]: half a year or even wreck it completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might have been my speech here and I'm not
American, not that optimistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only German and I was not able to tell
him, well, I will tell all the great
[SPEAKER_00]: successes we will have here, but well,
we did, we achieved it and now I stand
[SPEAKER_00]: here and really can tell you we did it and
I'm very glad to reach that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we reached this, we made a lot of
pressure to those politicians who were
[SPEAKER_00]: about to postpone the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, well, we need more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more time for the bureaucratic
things to get it all through, to look
[SPEAKER_00]: after the old cases for the amnesty,
to get people out of prison even and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't do it now at first of April and we
need more time and then we really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: burned down the whole internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We provided protest emails on our page at
the German Cannabis Association and only
[SPEAKER_00]: with this action we had 160,000 emails
sent to those local politicians who had to
[SPEAKER_00]: decide at the end in that second
parliament and that's the way we did it
[SPEAKER_00]: and the way we won in a real last minute
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is three and a half weeks ago,
this last sitting of that parliament and
[SPEAKER_00]: at the beginning of this session of this
Bundesrat, I was not sure what would
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, what they would decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that last minute decision to bring
it into force at April 1st so we did it
[SPEAKER_00]: really right in time for this ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, good luck for Alex Rogers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew more than I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, well, let's do ICBC in April 24
in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect time to celebrate this
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's completely legal to possess up to
25 grams of cannabis in public spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go three marcher plants,
completely legal and in the second half of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year, non-commercial cannabis growing
clubs will start to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have you all been waiting to
cheer and to celebrate such a big step?
[SPEAKER_00]: The next big step after Canada legalized?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the biggest celebration
since that time, since six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you could talk about Thailand maybe,
but well, that's not regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that happened in a kind
of military democracy with a crazy king.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know if they put it back next
week or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a real law that we achieved here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, if you want to cheer a bit,
if you want to celebrate a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can applaud now that we did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I tried cannabis in the nineties,
I didn't feel like a criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I wanted to do something about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a letter to the police and told
them, well, I've got four grams of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must come.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must confiscate it and do all the
paperwork, all that census stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in the media and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a protest action.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the beginning of my personal
way in cannabis activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in 1996, 28 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since that time, I'm working on
legalization, 22 years of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the German Cannabis Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: We founded it in 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was that time the first professional
German legalized advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also funny when people ask me,
what's your job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm a cannabis legalization advocate
at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great thing to say and a long
way to go, a long way to fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know I can process my four grams
of marijuana 28 years later, completely
[SPEAKER_00]: legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really great feeling after all
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But wait, I'm old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also have four grams of hash,
completely legal on top of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could also have four more four-gram
samples of nice kinds of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would still, the whole little
mountain, completely legal, up to 25
[SPEAKER_00]: grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great to have this,
to have achieved this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really feels wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shall tell you something about how we
got to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to bother you with too much
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And old stories, but just two key issues
about this, how we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, in my opinion,
this success is mainly driven by our civil
[SPEAKER_00]: society movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reach hundreds of thousands of people
every week with our content, with the
[SPEAKER_00]: German Cannabis Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alone, my weekly news show on YouTube has,
in the last weeks again, more than
[SPEAKER_00]: 100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are also strong on all the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have really kind of a little
internet army behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes really the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are able to activate many of them
at the right place, at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too much on the Swedes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not doing big demonstrations in
Berlin or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the internet, we are almost
unbeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I won a million dollars,
a million euros in a TV show, 2014,
[SPEAKER_00]: by vote of the people who saw the show and
who voted for me to get this million,
[SPEAKER_00]: to put it into the fight for legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example, we had the biggest
petition 2017 to the German parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, a big success driven by many,
many people and showing the parliament,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, there must be something behind this
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should care about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it took some years still.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all those little things were not so
little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all driven by many people up to
the point three and a half weeks ago when
[SPEAKER_00]: we had those 160,000 emails to the local
politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of them was able to get around
this issue on the social media channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter which one, if it is Instagram or
Twitter or whatever, everywhere they were
[SPEAKER_00]: confronted with the cannabis issue and
massively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I always tell you to support
civil society in your countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why I always told you to support us as
German Cannabis Association, as Alex
[SPEAKER_00]: Rogers did all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks to Alex Rogers again.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the industry people who
really saw this, supported it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and helped us to reach this goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second key issue was not so
surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will not say a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been legalized in Germany 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big game changer, big development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it changes mainly the view of older
people who are mainly against
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, who have been mainly against
legalization before because they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were afraid about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they said, well, it's a medicine
that is working better and has less side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects than my usual pills and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, well, it's nothing surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, good to know if you want to
legalize in your country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to go medical first maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's time for the bad news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany did not legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some say we did, but we didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, legalization means to have a legal
market, to be able to sell and to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in proper shops for adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the race about the third nation,
national state in the world, after Uruguay
[SPEAKER_00]: and Canada, to do this is still open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am watching the whole world and always
betting which one will be the next,
[SPEAKER_00]: which country will be the next,
seemed for a couple of years like a race
[SPEAKER_00]: between Colombia and Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a big step, but not this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the race is still open.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have is a far-going
decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in the European context,
it's quite far-going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have real-life things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that seemed to be further,
like the coffee shops in Holland or
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of cannabis social clubs in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But none of this is properly regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like they look away,
they let it happen somehow, like a
[SPEAKER_00]: gentleman agreement or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But real proper regulation before we had
only in little Malta.
[SPEAKER_00]: The German law is Malta in big with some
add-ons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Malta, you can possess seven grams of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Germany, it's 25 in public spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, you must hide your plants when you
do your home growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Germany, you can show them on the
balcony.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took two years after the law went
into effect to get the first few cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: clubs operating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, it will go much faster and many more
clubs at the end of this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where is your business there with
non-commercial clubs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And non-commercial home growing and
non-commercial everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to sell something, you want to
make your business, and well, you hear me
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about big step and you don't see
your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me tell you, there's one big space
going up in medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is already a big business in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now prescriptions seem to be
skyrocketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier for the doctors to prescribe
because it's no illegal drug anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the last three weeks already,
numbers are going up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you hear a lot about this in the
conference here the next two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is also happening, of course,
is everything about grow equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germans already bought the whole European
market for seeds empty and you don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: soil anymore, no seeds in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available anywhere because every second
German seems to be to start his grow right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's nice business and everything
around this and everything around what the
[SPEAKER_00]: clubs will need.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need space, they need all the growing
equipment and lamps and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need, well, they need to get
professional advice for their growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need financial support, maybe lots of
things to wrap around those clubs and the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, at least this is a step forward
also for business and don't underestimate
[SPEAKER_00]: what this means for the whole world and
for the whole cannabis legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: development in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you come from Northern America,
this is all, well, like peanuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see the development in the USA
and in Canada, but this is all North
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in North America, you have Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Asia, you have Thailand and that
was it more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and now the big industry country,
Germany, makes such a step.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not only about there is no shop in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a big impact on worldwide
cannabis reform development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there will be countries
following, doing several kinds of reforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, we will also see more
regulated markets for you to make your
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I must do it in English.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first thought I can talk in German.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I have my paper sheets here
and have to look one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second, third answer is about your
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not at the end right now,
I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our government wanted to do two steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second step is still in the pipeline
to make regional local model projects,
[SPEAKER_00]: model regions for the whole program for
regulated production, regulated shops from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed to sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole thing we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in all over Germany, but in regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if we get this done before the
election next year, this is the next real
[SPEAKER_00]: big step for whole Europe because,
well, this is going to be bigger than we
[SPEAKER_00]: have somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland has that kind of model project
also, but there are a few hundred people
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in those projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here the plan is to let every
inhabitant of those model regions buy
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in those shops, which alone the
region of Berlin would make up hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of consumers, not hundreds,
hundreds of thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, that is something completely
new, except maybe Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_00]: which also are doing those model projects
to grow legally for the coffee shops,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also a big step in the right,
in the same direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But well, this is the fight we have to do
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us bring this also on the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any cuts on the ground here,
any possibilities to do any lobbyism or
[SPEAKER_00]: support your civil society movement,
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us do the second step also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us show Europe that it's good and
necessary to build real framework for
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: For good quality cannabis in nice shops
for adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better for everyone, for the
consumers, for the whole society.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our next goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you could watch out for
and for your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, for our international guests,
the last word, the race is still open for
[SPEAKER_00]: full legalization, national state,
after Uruguay and Canada, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany shows big steps are possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have never thought it could be
possible, it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make your country the third one to
legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Work,
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Activism, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
