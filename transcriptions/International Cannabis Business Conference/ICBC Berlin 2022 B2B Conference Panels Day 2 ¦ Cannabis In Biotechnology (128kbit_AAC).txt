[SPEAKER_04]: So good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't this an awesome event?
[SPEAKER_04]: How many of you have only come here for
the first time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anza?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been going since 2017, and it is only
gonna get better.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, this morning, we are gonna
have a great conversation about cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: in technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the first question that comes
out of this is, is our panel named the
[SPEAKER_04]: right way, or should it be in reverse?
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: And why do you say that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you all in agreement with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the biotech world, the rules have
been formed for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we came into it, and we want to change
the rules towards what we want it to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm a medical doctor by education,
and through LGI Care, we care for 10,000
[SPEAKER_06]: patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think at that scale, you look at
things differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're looking at the research that's
coming out, but you're always in the back
[SPEAKER_06]: of your mind thinking, how is this gonna
be applicable to patients?
[SPEAKER_06]: How is this gonna be available to
patients?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's interesting also,
we did a little poll before the session,
[SPEAKER_06]: and just asked participants of the
session, does your doctor right now
[SPEAKER_06]: actually know about terpene profiles?
[SPEAKER_06]: And does he or she use that information
for treatment?
[SPEAKER_06]: And we saw that only a third of the people
responded, hey, my doctor, that influenced
[SPEAKER_06]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just for me, as a devil's advocate from
a medical perspective, I'm always thinking
[SPEAKER_06]: about, okay, biotechnology, and we're
seeing crazy technologies coming out.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna enhance and improve the
effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're always looking at, okay,
when will this be applicable?
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's look at the data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that brings up a really good
point, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So actually, just like the pharmaceutical
discussion, cannabis was banned as a plant
[SPEAKER_04]: and a drug right around the time that the
formal pharmaceutical industry got going
[SPEAKER_04]: in the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do you guys think from a medical
perspective, from an investment
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective, from an extraction
perspective, that this plant is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: impact the biotechnology industry and or
vice versa?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's a big question, but you
know, highlights.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we actually have a unique
opportunity here from a medical
[SPEAKER_06]: perspective that through cannabis,
we can offer more personalized treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have so many access points basically
within the plant to say, we're gonna do
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis DNA-based treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how we look at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are completely data-driven.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can plug in actually, starting with
terpene profiles, but also look at other
[SPEAKER_06]: biomarkers within the plant and plug that
with outcomes of patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we're just gonna start next
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to my mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just the beginning from a
scientific perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, I think we have 1,200,
1,300 studies, trials going on right now
[SPEAKER_03]: with CBD, with THC, 250, 300 different
trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking at multiple different
indications, different delivery methods to
[SPEAKER_03]: bring that medication in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just the beginning now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's only going forward much
quicker, especially since the UN voted to
[SPEAKER_03]: approve this to be a medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as more countries come on,
that's gonna open up the capital flow for
[SPEAKER_03]: people to make these larger investments
into the future and looking more as a
[SPEAKER_03]: biotech rather than a recreational-only
space that you've seen in other markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I have to say, I mean, as an
American-German sitting here, it is very
[SPEAKER_04]: refreshing to hear the doctor on the panel
talk about proteins.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that discussion even a couple of
years ago was almost unheard of.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't hear that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, I think there's gonna be other
discussions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to get into one of the topics
that we raised in agreement, which was,
[SPEAKER_04]: what about all of the delta-8 and the
delta-0s and the delta-10s that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: about coming from the US?
[SPEAKER_04]: When is that discussion gonna start to hit
here?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how is that gonna fit into a more
formal biotech structure than,
[SPEAKER_04]: say, just a wild west of recreational use?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the classic answer to almost
anything when you talk to any company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when do you need money or when's
this gonna happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always yesterday on Canvas,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Real quick, though, a couple numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason why there's an investment
banker on this panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a couple quick, few numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two undergrad degrees in science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for 15 years in biotech
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been better on three US patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked in investment banking seven
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked for 17 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've worked in cannabis in the US and
North America for eight years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've worked internationally in cannabis
for six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I've been, for the last two
years, chairman of the Scientific Advisory
[SPEAKER_01]: Council for Athletes for Care,
which is composed of four leading
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists, Ethan Rousseau, Guillermo
Mendoza, and Sanos from Spain,
[SPEAKER_01]: Raquel Perube and Deb Kimless.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so we've worked with a client
that's making, we actually talked to a
[SPEAKER_01]: client yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's making HHC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if you guys have heard
that, but instead of tetrahydrocannabinol,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hexahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's got a whole different form
factor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have CETL groups being added
to the things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also in Europe, one thing to
bring up that's interesting, the United
[SPEAKER_01]: Circuit Court of Appeals about two months
ago allowed, came out and said that Delta
[SPEAKER_01]: A THC is actually now legal nationally
under the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, to your question, where is this
all going?
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of the big problems,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have, let's say, a Delta A,
which is also being made from CBD right
[SPEAKER_04]: now in the United States, once you get
into a much more formalized environment,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is Europe and the medical
discussion, how do you see path to market,
[SPEAKER_04]: market authorizations happening in a
situation where, again, it's even more
[SPEAKER_04]: unusual than the drug cannabis or do you
see, as this becomes more accepted within
[SPEAKER_04]: the biotech and pharmaceutical community,
that will flip?
[SPEAKER_04]: Any thoughts on this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's an interesting perspective
when you have the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective and you juxtapose that to the
way Europe is looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: and producers, they're pushing the limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the politicians are either embarrassed
to address the issue or some of the states
[SPEAKER_03]: are addressing the issue and combining
these two synthetic either under cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: or allowing them to proliferate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're very limited from the European
perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: These kind of advances would require,
in my mind at least, clinical trials and
[SPEAKER_03]: more data in order to bring these to
market or bring these to fruition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this point, we for sure are going
to be banking for R&D purposes,
[SPEAKER_03]: semi-synthetics, but the usage is not yet
clear in the market and even terpenes,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're registering those as excipients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavor, we're not making claims as to what
their positive or negative effects may be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's fun to watch it from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're way out there on these products
and in a good way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean it negatively, but we also
have to find out what is the exact science
[SPEAKER_03]: behind it to make this a reality for
Europe in my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next question, is the biotech discussion
really only limited to the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: discussion or is it a broader spectrum of
discussion?
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be interesting to hear from me
from Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: has been advanced, let's say somewhere
between six to 20 years, I guess,
[SPEAKER_06]: some ballpark number.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what does it actually mean within the
country?
[SPEAKER_06]: So all the new research, all the new
applications, all the biotech innovations
[SPEAKER_06]: in the U.S., are they being applied in the
U.S.?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it still kind of left-bench work?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your guess?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one thing that's interesting that
we've been trying to do, and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody in this audience would agree,
that everybody knows somebody that's used
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of preparation and it's really
helped them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all this anecdotal data.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt this plan works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the one thing that we're trying to
do, we've always tried to work with
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and provide capital so they can
do the right experiments or get the right
[SPEAKER_01]: data, whether it's in a clinical trial or
something less.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody would agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our perspective is the entourage effect is
real, but I think in order to really get
[SPEAKER_01]: the value out of this plan, we need to do
it on a molecule-by-molecule basis and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of deconstruct.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's over, I think, 600 compounds in
the cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's one thing that I think
everybody in this room and probably
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody on the panel would agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do the work, whether it's under
stringent conditions or even maybe less
[SPEAKER_01]: stringent conditions, to find out really
what is the value of this plan on a
[SPEAKER_01]: molecular basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when you get into delivery issues
and delivery discussions and the
[SPEAKER_04]: technology that goes along with that,
I think that that's also gonna have a much
[SPEAKER_04]: more, I guess, a greater impact on this
discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's, I'm gonna flip this back to
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that in Europe, there's going
to be more of a focus on this discussion
[SPEAKER_04]: from the biotechnology discussion first on
the recreational side?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm gonna throw that out there in part
because for those of you who are not
[SPEAKER_04]: German or don't live here, the vast
majority of medications in this system are
[SPEAKER_04]: generic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, most Germans are used to going to
a doctor, getting a prescription,
[SPEAKER_04]: going to the apotheke or the pharmacy and
getting it for 10 euros because the
[SPEAKER_04]: government is allowed to pre-negotiate
contracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that kind of discussion going to have
an impact on this plant and the
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization of it so far?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you see, like the United States
perhaps, more of a discussion of the
[SPEAKER_04]: biotechnology happening in the
recreational side first because of the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulatory structure here and the
difficulties of getting a mainstream drug
[SPEAKER_04]: into the system?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Nano, for example, or Patches,
or?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that depends a bit on how it all
plays out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what the regulatory framework for
legalization in the recreation space will
[SPEAKER_06]: really look like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I think we're in a unique situation
where we have had five years of a medical
[SPEAKER_06]: market in Germany, which was a very
advanced law, especially in Europe,
[SPEAKER_06]: European space, and we've been looking at
also the Bayfarm results.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did like a supervisory study.
[SPEAKER_06]: The results are not great there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think from a politician standpoint,
with all the different lobbyists involved
[SPEAKER_06]: there, you're gonna look at data.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna look at hard fact data,
which sounds a little bit boring,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we have, again, also looking at new
types of applications and new types of
[SPEAKER_06]: biotechnology innovations.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can apply that already now in a medical
space.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can have regulated results,
have results that we can write on,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then apply them in a recreation space.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're an extractor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna throw this back to you for a
second.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I say this?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the biotechnology perspective
for me is, at this point, is like how do
[SPEAKER_04]: you separate the cannabinoids out?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you make them effective,
and how do you bring them to market beyond
[SPEAKER_04]: the technology itself?
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's my question to you is,
in the United States right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's probably better people out
there to talk about this, but for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: Delta-8 seems to me to be still a
narcotic, even though it's coming from
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just because you're submitting it to a
process, chemical process or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: does that fundamentally change the nature
of a cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a lot to unpack there.
[SPEAKER_03]: From one point, we're manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not necessarily confined to the
beginning stage of extraction,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we're looking to bring finished
products to the market and bring
[SPEAKER_03]: authorizations to the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany's a little bit different in that
respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've kind of made their own rules to
circumvent the herbal medicine rules,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's quite complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're stuck to a singular molecule,
dronabinol, and they're looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: compounding the magisterial prep,
and this is fine for advancing,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least the beginning stages of an
advancement, but when you look at market
[SPEAKER_03]: authorizations for herbal medicines,
these rules have been set well before
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis got into play in Europe,
and you have to think in those terms when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're making whatever medicines you're
making, and you're confined to singular
[SPEAKER_03]: elements, a THC distillate, CBD
distillate, THCA, and these ones like CDN,
[SPEAKER_03]: which you're seeing popping up in
Switzerland and the UK, these don't exist
[SPEAKER_03]: in the monographs currently.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a nice building blocks in the
beginning for us to develop medicines,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's a clear pathway with some
countries to get these authorizations,
[SPEAKER_03]: and as other countries kind of develop
their rules, and even if Germany,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's say, goes recreational and what does
that mean, maybe that'll be a flourishing
[SPEAKER_03]: flower market, and at the end,
the doctors will be looking for innovative
[SPEAKER_03]: products, or along the extractable bases
would be my guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to go back to your question I
think, Marty, you had on rec, or adult
[SPEAKER_01]: use, whatever you want to call it,
and biotech, so one thing I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting for people to note is,
so back in 2013, 2014, I was chief
[SPEAKER_01]: business officer of Serna, which is one of
the first public companies in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a company at the same time called
ABU.
[SPEAKER_01]: ABU was in Colorado, and they had these
four or five formulations that this is
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna make you calm, this is gonna make
you creative, so I was lucky enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: work at a company called Affymetrix in the
late 90s, a leading genomics company,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they essentially came up with the term
pharmacogenomics because of their
[SPEAKER_01]: technology, and that's one thing you guys
ought to note is that even on the rec
[SPEAKER_01]: side, one thing we need to do more of is
the human genetic side, so if my wife even
[SPEAKER_01]: takes a small preparation of any kind of
cannabinoid, she goes off the rails,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's one thing, even on the rec side,
that we can do better on characterizing
[SPEAKER_01]: the human genetic side, the SNPs,
the biomarkers, because everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: most people will react differently to
these preparations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also for medical, so that's actually
my question in return, maybe, looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: both personalized treatment, but also
personalized consumption, maybe in the
[SPEAKER_06]: recreation space.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I think there's an opportunity,
maybe looking at DNA, looking at other
[SPEAKER_06]: biomarkers, to create products that kind
of plug in there, so from a creation,
[SPEAKER_06]: from an extraction standpoint,
are you looking at what type of data would
[SPEAKER_06]: we need from customers, patients,
to then formulate something, but still be
[SPEAKER_06]: able to scale it, and how are you looking
at the market?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we had this conversation back in
the green room as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this plant fundamentally different to
begin with, and say, poppies?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is cannabis so different from that,
and what impact is that going to have on
[SPEAKER_04]: this discussion as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one thought, and I don't know a
whole lot about heroin and poppies,
[SPEAKER_01]: but my guess is that they do try to
concentrate down heroin to the point of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's the only active agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mentioned before, there's over 600,
and it could be 600 active agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that gets back to the point of,
you know, are all these cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: tropines have some value to some
indication, or, I mean, my guess is some
[SPEAKER_01]: of them have no value at all, but then
maybe do they have value in combination?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's the one thing,
getting back to the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's the magic, I think,
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any questions from the audience
at this point?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one over there, there's a couple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we are, but you know, I always open
the, there are a lot of experts in the
[SPEAKER_04]: audience also, so there are a couple of
questions right over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all experts in this audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it again for Marguerite Arles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the entire panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the entire panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start up here, and then we'll work
our way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Kagan from Reogenics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to know your opinions about
synthetic, well, there are a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: ways using biotechnology to produce
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is through synthetic chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some is by biosynthesis, using hosts like
algae or yeast or bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the system that we use,
which is growing stem cells of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't produce the whole entourage
effect, it produces specifically a group
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabinoids, but this is the biotech
for the production of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that going to, how are these
systems going to impact the regulations in
[SPEAKER_00]: the market?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think just medically speaking,
as a doctor, you're pretty much open to
[SPEAKER_06]: every type of application that,
you know, is safe in the patient's hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's a little bit boring,
but also down to the point, depends on the
[SPEAKER_06]: data, depends on the results.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get a bit, I think what,
it's interesting in these panels also,
[SPEAKER_06]: we were looking at maybe two to 300,000
cannabis patients in Germany, which is
[SPEAKER_06]: still tiny.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, still by a 10 fold at least,
so many more patients in Germany could
[SPEAKER_06]: benefit from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which also means it needs to be more
centered, and it also means types of
[SPEAKER_06]: application needs to be more centered.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think synthetics, as also Margaret
said, when it comes to regular medication
[SPEAKER_03]: in Germany, is one of the ways to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, I mean, this has been a war
waging for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hundreds of millions have gone into
biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to get to a more economical
format.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clearly, this is very attractive from the
biotech industry, especially in places
[SPEAKER_03]: like USA, where the FDA is more guided on
a synthetic basis as opposed to an herbal
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to keep a global perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a lot of countries that are going
to be coming on that have more herbal
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like India, as an example, and Europe,
they're more accepting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But clearly, all of them have a space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can reproduce at an economical
rate through biosynthesis, through
[SPEAKER_03]: semisynthesis, biocatalysis, whatever your
process is, there's a market for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One quick thing to add to that,
Michael, is I think the interesting thing
[SPEAKER_01]: is we have so many indications,
potential indications, that could be
[SPEAKER_01]: solved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have so many of these molecules in
this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That matrix that you combine to try to
find combinations thereof, to deconvolute
[SPEAKER_01]: that, it's going to be a big issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one last thing, we don't like to call
it synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to call it alternative production
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we believe is we have no idea if
it's going to be used in colon chemistry
[SPEAKER_01]: or some combination of phyto or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing we do believe is the way to
do it, the cheapest or the highest quality
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids is probably going to win
over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just add, I mean, I think how it's
produced is one issue, and also then how
[SPEAKER_04]: it's absorbed by the human body.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think about, for example,
a technology like nano, and if this is
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetic versus natural discussion there
as well, that's getting into some very
[SPEAKER_04]: other long and involved questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have another comment to make,
or?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Armin Brasch from Four Limit,
and I'm representing also the medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis division of the association,
the German one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what you're addressing is purely
pharmaceutical development questions,
[SPEAKER_05]: starting from the extract, that's the
biotechnology part, with very clear
[SPEAKER_05]: guidelines on how to get a product or an
active actually approved by the
[SPEAKER_05]: authorities.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you talk about the terpene
characterization, do you really see the
[SPEAKER_05]: chance that this can be characterized so
that it does fulfill the guidelines and
[SPEAKER_05]: that will allow approval of this kind of
an active material?
[SPEAKER_05]: And also you're addressing delivery
systems, nanos or whatever, which is again
[SPEAKER_05]: purely pharmaceutical questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I still feel that the pharmaceutical
industry, this audience is a bit
[SPEAKER_05]: underrepresented.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe my question now to you is,
how do you rate the complexity in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: timing and in terms of layers in that
area, so that at the end there will be a
[SPEAKER_05]: product that does meet the market?
[SPEAKER_05]: Both in the full characterization of the
terpene levels and the actives,
[SPEAKER_05]: but also with delivery systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: From your background now and from your
experience from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'd add to that, with regards to
whether it's the EMA here in Europe or
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the FDA, and also since I'm an
investment banker, we deal with the SEC,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody in this audience would
agree that regulators are always buying
[SPEAKER_01]: the curve, whether it's crypto or
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And matter of fact, somebody wants to talk
to me later, we heard some recent stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: from the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one question, getting back
to your thought on the pharma side,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the regulators, one question we need to
figure out is how to do this better,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the regulators are probably going
to screw it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're already screwing it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The FDA should have done a lot more than
they've already done in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the EMA supposedly is literally
sitting on their hands too, so I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if that really answered your
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that describes the current
situation, because regulators are really,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can build into this as much as you
want on complexity.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other hand, that would limit
finally an improved product, but how do
[SPEAKER_05]: you rate it and how do you see it maybe
different in the U.S.?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective, you have to realize that from
a recreational point, we can make a
[SPEAKER_03]: product tomorrow, put it right on the
shelf and sell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can make, a hot seller right
now for, who knows if it's even,
[SPEAKER_03]: the efficacy is there, but it's CBN and
THC for a nighttime sleeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, is that product tested and does that
product have results that are tangible
[SPEAKER_03]: from a medical perspective?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the FDA perspective, they turned a
blind eye to all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're more concentrated on the
epidiolexes and the saltevexes in a
[SPEAKER_03]: million of trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I pointed out at the beginning,
there's hundreds of THC trials in the
[SPEAKER_03]: thousand plus of CBN trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you juxtapose that to Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have very, very strange
regulations in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another debate for another time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you have countries like Portugal,
which are adopting the herbal rules,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a path to the ECM, which is a
path into the European market.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Germany would thumb their nose up at
that and say, no, this isn't going to
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll let a pharmacist compound this
in a completely unsanitary environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to look at from a country to
country basis and how they're developing
[SPEAKER_03]: these rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And are these federal regulators
overworked?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they want to deal with this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they surely don't want to deal with
thousands of cannabis people pushing the
[SPEAKER_03]: limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Albert.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to cut everybody off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it again for Martin Goodarm and
the entire panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Dr. Sassano.
