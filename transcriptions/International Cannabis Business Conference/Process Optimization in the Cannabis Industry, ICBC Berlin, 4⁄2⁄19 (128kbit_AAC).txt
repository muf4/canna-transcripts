[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Josh Holub.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Sirius Greenhouse Solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're based in Boulder, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working in the cannabis industry
since 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a dispensary owner, indoor
grower, and we've then developed this
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse that we've been selling for the
past eight years and developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with a partner who is German.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lives in Colorado as well, and our goal
has always been high efficiency in growing
[SPEAKER_01]: using sunlight as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's what the plant wants and it's
the most efficient way to grow as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: operational costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to speak for a quick second
about the buildings, what we do,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we think is the most optimal way to
grow cannabis, and then Jem will step in
[SPEAKER_01]: and talk about how his group controls the
interior environment of indoor grows as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as the greenhouse, what's quite
relevant with our greenhouse and his
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So real quick, we have a hybrid greenhouse
design that I'll talk about, climate
[SPEAKER_01]: control, just very simply.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll let Jem do that, and then a few
featured projects so you get a feel for
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is that we're doing across the US,
Canada, and now diving to Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia, and South America as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal is high yields, highest quality,
and lowest operating cost possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't deal with GMP in the US yet,
but we will, but we're quite aware of it
[SPEAKER_01]: and we design our buildings to be able to
be GMP certified.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal in the end is the highest
quality cannabis that we can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the United States, in Colorado
specifically, cannabis is being grown for
[SPEAKER_01]: about $1,000 a pound is the wholesale
cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: We find that our growers are getting up to
$1,500 a pound just because of the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a real differentiation to be
had, and it shows itself financially.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are growing a really high quality
product, we find the sun allows that to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Controlling the greenhouse itself is a
really more difficult process,
[SPEAKER_01]: but necessary to create this high quality
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a quick slide to show a
traditional European greenhouse versus
[SPEAKER_01]: something that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a highly insulated structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It appears that there's less glazing,
but oftentimes there's more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: We allow as much par light as possible and
also full UV through our glazings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike an indoor grow, the greenhouses
that have full UV have really high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, more cannabinoids, more
terpenes, more flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant wants UV and you can see it in
the quality of the product that comes off
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our design is, we call it an offset gable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We face them south, but the goal here is
that we actually are insulating so we can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in cold leather climates,
whether it's Northern Europe or we are
[SPEAKER_01]: high in the mountains in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can still maintain very steady
temperatures, but it also allows us to
[SPEAKER_01]: have very controlled, so if it's warm and
it gets cold, we don't see fluctuations in
[SPEAKER_01]: the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The greenhouse functions very much like an
indoor grow room, very small swings in
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and humidity, but still
allowing that natural sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have supplemental lighting at all
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We say, worst case scenario, we're an
indoor grow, so you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: standardization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best case scenario, you're full sun,
four to five times more light than an
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor grow would have with zero lighting
costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of our design with our south-facing
greenhouse and our solid-facing north
[SPEAKER_01]: walls is that we can harvest light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the winter, we are low on light
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Germany, you'd have less light,
obviously, than you would in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What our greenhouses can do is if the
light misses the plant, if it goes over
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, it will hit the north wall of
the greenhouse and actually bounce back to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see growth heading towards the
north, which is not normal, but we
[SPEAKER_01]: designed it to harvest light, to optimize
lighting levels as much as possible to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce operational costs and keep the
plants happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an example of a custom greenhouse
that we've built in Boulder, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 22,000 square feet or 2,200 square
meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's broken into five greenhouses,
420 square meters each, with an insulated
[SPEAKER_01]: headhouse that has processing,
offices, indoor veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things are flexible, but this gives
you an idea of what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the left is the south, and so we orient
the greenhouses towards the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: The right side of those structures is
north.
[SPEAKER_01]: We insulate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can hold heat and harvest light.
[SPEAKER_01]: This greenhouse has 90% light
transmission, full UV, and when the sun is
[SPEAKER_01]: out, we measure lighting in PPFD for the
most part, and there's 2,200 PPFD,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas the best grow room might say it
has 1,000, but maybe it really has 600 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 700.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really have high light levels in
these greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're constantly evolving with the
glazings that we're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows the light into the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with a Japanese company,
Asahi Glass, and have an ETFE offering,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is up to 96% light transmission with
full UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: In colder climates, we can do a double
layer of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives us some insulation as well as
up to 90% light transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with a German company called
Yvonnek for an acrylic glazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a higher insulation value than
traditional glazings, 90% light
[SPEAKER_01]: transmission, full UV, and then for a lot
of the hemp growers, we'll use a
[SPEAKER_01]: polycarbonate which is a plastic,
and plastic cannot allow UV through
[SPEAKER_01]: because it would degrade, but UV actually
promotes THC production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a lot of growers in hemp who don't
have the most stable genetics just yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially polycarbonate is a nice option
because it doesn't allow the UV through.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buildings are actually quite flexible
based on what you're growing and how
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the most important parts
when we get to cleanliness control is that
[SPEAKER_01]: we keep the structures as smaller spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these might be 3,000 to 5,000 square
feet, 300 to 500 square meters,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll break them up into multiple
units.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add as many as you want,
but this allows us to control biosecurity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a bug or a mold or a mildew or
something, we can keep it in one house,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it will not spread unless you spread
it actually physically yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can also maintain different climates in
each house, and that'll be something that
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim can talk about, but depending on
strain, we can have a warmer dryer room or
[SPEAKER_01]: a cooler, more humid room, or depending on
stage of growth in the flowering process,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can actually allow a younger flowering
plant to have a warmer environment with
[SPEAKER_01]: more humidity, and as flowering progresses
towards the end, we can actually dry the
[SPEAKER_01]: room out slightly, but it gives us an
operational cost advantage because we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to cool or dehumidify as much
depending on stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also do design vented greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of our hemp propagators will vent a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's significantly cheaper to use outside
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: For GMP certification, it's actually much
more difficult to impossible, but in the
[SPEAKER_01]: States, that's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's all veg growth and there's no
flower and we're only working on
[SPEAKER_01]: propagation, a vented greenhouse sometimes
can be a good option for cost savings.
[SPEAKER_01]: More and more though, we are moving
towards sealed greenhouses, completely
[SPEAKER_01]: closed environment, minimal venting,
just for human occupancy, which could be
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 500 CFM, one fan, necessary just for
humans to be working in the space,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for the most part, these are
completely sealed environments,
[SPEAKER_01]: high CO2, high light, and very controlled,
and we do a lot of our control based on
[SPEAKER_01]: vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we can maintain stable temps and
humidity, CO2 retention, odor control is a
[SPEAKER_01]: big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're building in urban areas or
industrial zones, odor can be a major
[SPEAKER_01]: issue with growers, maybe the most
difficult issue to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we seal the greenhouses, we have way
less odor problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: GMP certified, high biosecurity because
we're not bringing in outside air.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've seen in the US with the hemp
market now taking off is that vented
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis grows are taking male pollen from
outside hemp grows and seeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: which isn't a total disaster if you're
processing but you have less lower quality
[SPEAKER_01]: product and you're making less money.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gives you complete control over
what's happening inside your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then again, vapor pressure deficit is how
we control the greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that many people know
about it, but it gives us a range of
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures along with a humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperatures can fluctuate as long as we
take humidities with it and the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: don't feel the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can optimally pull water and
nutrients through and transpire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Climate control, which controls our light
depth systems, our fertigation systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: our heating, cooling, and dehumidification
systems are getting very smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've developed a sequence of operations
in our greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's flexible.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are software-based controllers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're viewable on your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even control things on your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most importantly, we track all data in the
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that's happening, every piece
of equipment that's on, when it's on,
[SPEAKER_01]: how long it's on, we can see what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we can go back and look at that data,
analyze it, make adjustments moving
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can find what we've had a really good
harvest and completely mimic that with the
[SPEAKER_01]: same strain, with the same eight-week run
of climate controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows us to really dial in what's
happening in the houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't really a guessing game anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what's happening and we can mimic
it or we can adjust it to make it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just a few examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a 4,000 square meter or 40,000
square feet hemp breeding facility that we
[SPEAKER_01]: just built in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each house has different hemp pollen being
thrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's producing seed for farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two farthest south houses are climate
mimickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have light depth and full climate
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in Oregon, but he has a client from
Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can grow his hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a Florida climate based on Florida
daily lighting integral, humidity levels
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything else, a farmer from Florida
can come here, step into that greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: and he says, here's your Florida crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is this seed grown in Florida
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can mimic any environment in the world
in the greenhouses and show his clients
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening while in the other eight
houses he's breeding for seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another hemp propagation
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a vented greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same style, but slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is at about 7,000 feet of elevation,
2,300 meters of elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Year round growing, cloning, seed
breeding, but very controlled and highly
[SPEAKER_01]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an inside shot of one of our
newest cannabis greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a little series plug of what we do,
we produce in the US, we have
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing in Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe we have the most controlled
greenhouse available on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our clients are proving that out every day
with incredibly high quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lab results that we get back from the
flower that is being produced in these
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses is like nothing the lab guys
have ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: After eight years, we get this often.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have never seen cannabis like this
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest thing is, what we do is we
design a structure, but then we are along
[SPEAKER_01]: with the growers for their hopefully
entire lifetime of growing, always
[SPEAKER_01]: learning, always tweaking and pushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is babysitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, babysitting, but also they learn
stuff that we don't know because we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: operating in the houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tell us things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I pass it to Jim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jim is more on the climate side and he can
talk about how they're controlling the
[SPEAKER_01]: climate in houses like ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Jim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Enorama Technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We provide environmental solutions to
greenhouses and indoor facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super important what they are doing
because the technologies we provide,
[SPEAKER_02]: we depend on the structures as well for
them to actually be in great use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having good isolation and having good
design and structure is super important
[SPEAKER_02]: for the technologies to work at their best
capabilities inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to adapt the whole hall from the
structure, the construction to the end
[SPEAKER_02]: game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything needs to be intact with each
other, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also focus a lot on efficiency in
energy saving.
[SPEAKER_02]: In light and also in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we make sure that there is a lot of
redundancy in the greenhouses or in indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also focus on increasing the yield and
the quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: The technologies we provide enables you to
grow a whole year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our background is actually
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been in cannabis this last
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have manufacturing in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our offices are in Switzerland and in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also filter the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cool the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything about the climate inside,
we try to tackle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our technology enables you to control
absolute humidity and control temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without changing the temperature,
we can control the humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And humidity has a major role in the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So over time, it can be very rewarding or
very painful to have bacteria and fungi
[SPEAKER_02]: and other mold use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we do, we take the humidity out
and discharge it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also clean the air while we're
doing this with our liquid desiccant
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And VPD is super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simply put, it's the pressure on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more pressure there is,
the less transpiration will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the less transpiration, which is,
let's say, sweating the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: the absorption is also related to all of
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the absorption will be less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why designs get good quality crops is
because of the absorption rates they get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So controlling the humidity is super
important for the plants inside and
[SPEAKER_02]: biohazardness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk about the patent technology we
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do mostly closed-loop systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sealed completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important to have an exhaust and
also control cooling and heating and
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are some designs we have done in
Europe and in the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see we do multi-room, multi-zone
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the rooms can have different
point views.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even in the same room, you can have
different machines acting differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the end of the room can have a
different cooling and humidity level than
[SPEAKER_02]: the beginning of the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are all up to clients' custom how
they want to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see more designs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, we manage air quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: We designed a silencer now because most of
the regulations are getting stricter and
[SPEAKER_02]: stricter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people around, like in Florida and in
Zurich, they complain a lot about smell,
[SPEAKER_02]: odor, and they complain about noise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try to tackle this with odor
trapping in our machines, which is quite
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to do, actually, because odor is a
molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we control water molecules in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've been showing great progress on
odor trapping as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we are doing this, we also
filter the air, sterilize it, so you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: need extra filters or anything in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep on going.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the grow rooms we built.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here you can see many air handlers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all those air handlers can get
different comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were talking about data
collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: All our technology also collects data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can learn how your air circulation
was, how much humidity levels you were at,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how much energy you were spending.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you gather all this, and then you can
have a better analysis of your climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are some of the machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our machines go outside, so we don't take
space inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are a little more industrial-sized,
so we handle really big places.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the silencers on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these guys odor trap, dehumidify,
cool heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a one-stop HVAC solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen that all the technologies
inside a greenhouse or a facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor facility, needs to interact with
each other, which becomes a little messy
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: To use many different technologies from
many different companies and try to adapt
[SPEAKER_02]: them all together can cause more risk and
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we developed a machine which can
provide all of this with just one single
[SPEAKER_02]: brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also control the machine, and our
systems come with climate control inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also can track this through an
application and anywhere from the web
[SPEAKER_02]: login.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also control any other
electrical devices inside through our
[SPEAKER_02]: software, which comes with the technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also control CO2 if it needs to be
controlled by tanks or by burners.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can add coolers and extra heaters and
we can also go modular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if your facility is small first and you
have a modular design in structure,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can grow the equipment while growing
the structures, which is an advantage for
[SPEAKER_02]: people who doesn't want to start really
big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to point out that we've
worked with growers in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado is a dry place where we live.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's predominantly dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years ago, we had a really wet May.
[SPEAKER_01]: It rained almost the whole month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most growers were not set up for that at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were using vented greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost all of them lost crops if they
were in late flowering in May.
[SPEAKER_01]: All lost to powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what a controlled environment does
off the bat with your initial design is
[SPEAKER_01]: really more than anything an ideal growing
environment, but more so it's insurance
[SPEAKER_01]: that regardless of what's happening
outside in the environment, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have the ability to control the
interior environment and not lose a crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those guys who lost crops might
have lost half a million dollars in
[SPEAKER_01]: product in that month, which might have
paid for or half paid for the upgraded
[SPEAKER_01]: build out that they could have or should
have done in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is really an insurance policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when you're planning for
your business to know that you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have a catastrophic failure
because you're ready to handle any
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental thing that might come your
way is a huge benefit for your operational
[SPEAKER_01]: success.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also collecting the data and it enables
you to go to that date of point where you
[SPEAKER_02]: are in trouble to show that your
conditions were actually not causing the
[SPEAKER_02]: problem because you can go to if the
dispensaries which you see now in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, this is happening a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Millions of dollars worth of products,
they're getting recalled.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the growers can actually fight for
their rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they have the data in hands,
they can go to any day, any time and show
[SPEAKER_02]: the conditions that was growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also super important for for
growers to be able to to to show the
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions of the climate, which is
collecting data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's quite important also to
show the energy levels that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's getting used.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a facility in in in Florida and
using a HVAC system from somebody else and
[SPEAKER_02]: getting all these technologies together at
the end, the energy costs and the energy
[SPEAKER_02]: levels go really, really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, using efficient
technologies helps a lot with with the end
[SPEAKER_02]: quality of the product and how you get to
that quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much of this goes back to initial
planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, you know, the more you plan in
the early stages, the better off you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be with the success of your
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we see is in Colorado, indoor growers
with average HVAC controls are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: between for 30 to 50 cents a gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our clients in the greenhouse
with a with a well designed HVAC system
[SPEAKER_01]: that's designed for operational efficiency
are growing for as little as two cents a
[SPEAKER_01]: gram in the greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of that's because we don't use light
very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of that is because we have optimal
conditions because sunlight, along with
[SPEAKER_01]: good environmental controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants are totally outyielding what
you might normally see an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of those things bring down
operational costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as wholesale prices drop over time,
which they inevitably will, the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: growers have a guaranteed product at a low
operational cost that they know is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep them in the game longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the guys who started indoor,
which is maybe a thing that's happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany and how it had to start in
Colorado at the time, the indoor growers
[SPEAKER_01]: are either going out of business or
transitioning to a more controlled,
[SPEAKER_01]: better engineered, designed greenhouse
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The initial investment sometimes can be
higher in let's say ETFE.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually recommend ETFE a lot in the
Middle East.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a really, really good
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a little bit more expensive if
I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's up to us to actually show why the
initial investments are sometimes can be
[SPEAKER_02]: higher and better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really important in the long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is what the growers and
people who wants to get into this business
[SPEAKER_02]: should really think about and plan it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were saying planning is super
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should really know on how advanced you
want to go because as innovation goes,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not stopping every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is something new coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's up to the growers if they want to
adapt that or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I beg you, use the innovations.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: More and more now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early on in Colorado, these were smaller
growers who were just trying to get into
[SPEAKER_01]: the game for as little money as possible
and then survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more and more now what we see is much
more organized business groups who aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: as frightened to spend the money but still
concerned but it's way more established
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we see people who are way more
willing to make the investment when we
[SPEAKER_01]: show them what the outcome is and what the
possibilities are with the right building
[SPEAKER_01]: and the right mechanical equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you agree if I said which is mostly
fully sealed houses gives the best
[SPEAKER_02]: product?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say most of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or fully controlled greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: As in the exhaust, as in everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know the story of Oregon right now,
Oregon has a huge amount of outdoor or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe greenhouse grown cannabis that is
okay quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say five years worth of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, more weed than anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like four times the amount of
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everybody in Oregon was an everyday pot
smoker, they would still have too much
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've offered to go up to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea there is growing okay
cannabis at this point is really not a
[SPEAKER_01]: business plan at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those people who did not make the
investment in the way they're growing are
[SPEAKER_01]: paying for it really like with everything
they have right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the clients that we have who've
spent the most money where people say this
[SPEAKER_01]: is actually you're going way overboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous what you're doing are
getting 30 to 50 percent more wholesale
[SPEAKER_01]: per pound for their product because it's
such high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes out of the lab results,
it shows that it's such high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you both very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have time for some questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a question or two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone have a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has used all of their words
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so very much, Jim and
Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for Jim and Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very enlightening, very
educational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
