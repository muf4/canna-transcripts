[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everyone, my name is Chris Budd.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm one of the subject matter experts and
founders of iSolocity.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are a quality management software that
helps cannabis companies across the world
[SPEAKER_06]: automate their QMS compliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we do and we make headaches go
away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jorgen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my name is Jorgen Bickel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm co-founder and managing director of
Starsome Bickel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are producing vaporizers as maybe one
of the most famous one is our volcano
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporizer, but also a few handheld
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody, my name is Lewis Koski.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the chief strategy officer for Metric.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a leading track and trace provider
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: We provide track and trace to 23 different
government agencies across the country and
[SPEAKER_04]: in Guam.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been spending quite a bit of time
investing into a better understanding
[SPEAKER_04]: what's happening here in the European
market over the last 18 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're really looking forward to the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi everybody, my name is Natal Partanski.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the founder and CEO of a company
called Sorting Robotics.
[SPEAKER_05]: We build the robots for cannabis
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our main one being the Gico robot,
a device that infuses joints and blunts
[SPEAKER_05]: and pre-rolls with cannabis concentrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Among that we do a bunch of other various
robotics technologies, vision systems,
[SPEAKER_05]: vaporizer filling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it's interesting being here in
Berlin and meeting everyone in the
[SPEAKER_05]: different sectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So looking forward to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi guys, my name is Hans.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm regional director for C-cell for
Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So C-cell is part of Smoar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoartek is the largest web equipment
manufacturer in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And C-cell is the brand which is dedicated
to making hardware for vaporizers for
[SPEAKER_03]: distillates, life resin, rosin,
high viscosity extracts basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And today I have the pleasure of being the
moderator of this high tech, high times
[SPEAKER_06]: panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right guys, so talking about where
technology is going, not just from the
[SPEAKER_06]: producer's perspective, but also the end
consumers.
[SPEAKER_06]: How does technology need to change to help
this industry become more successful and
[SPEAKER_06]: safer for the consumer?
[SPEAKER_06]: Jorgen, I'll let you nail this one and
then we'll go along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course a vaporizer is a high tech
device.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that from a design perspective,
you need to be very careful what you are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People at the end of the day are inhaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the vapor you are producing is getting
into the lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the technology side, it is very
important to have a very high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, technology goes through
everything you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes through your design.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes through your production process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like traceability are extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our case, to produce a medical device,
the certification is very important like
[SPEAKER_01]: ESO 13485.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now new certifications available
from UL 8139.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new standard which is used for
vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we all follow, at least with every
new product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, on the end, on the customer
side, of course, all of our new products,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have coming with an app.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're always able to control your device
with an app, but you're also able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: statistics out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see how long you used it,
what is your main temperature you're using
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, it gives also feedback to
us once we get a device back on hand to
[SPEAKER_01]: see how it was used and how was it if
there was a failure, what was the failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it improves the experience for the
customer and it improves our database to
[SPEAKER_01]: make better products in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Luce, before I get to you, it's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of like the car model,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the cars are now analyzing how
you're driving it and feeding that
[SPEAKER_06]: information back to the OEMs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what type of improvements have you guys
made based on key data points that you've
[SPEAKER_06]: collected?
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me an example of a product
enhancement you've done that has met
[SPEAKER_06]: consumer trends or uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our case, what we have seen a lot of
things how people are using it and which
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature they are using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this was one of the main things we
got back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end, this is what the customer
can do by himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Luce.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, taking a look at the backend
infrastructure of any producer and being
[SPEAKER_06]: from North America and being immersed in
that market, what are certain things that
[SPEAKER_06]: you are seeing or that you guys are
predicting at Metric that the evolution of
[SPEAKER_06]: data flow from seed to consumer,
but how are we making those more efficient
[SPEAKER_06]: as well for the kind of producers?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so for those of you who don't know,
Metric is a platform that government uses
[SPEAKER_04]: to collect data from the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So every actor that is active along the
supply chain in a commercial market,
[SPEAKER_04]: it contributes data along the supply chain
and ends up being this massive data set
[SPEAKER_04]: that government uses to help inform policy
and kind of evolve it over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we've seen happen is that not only
does that data set really help government
[SPEAKER_04]: be able to create some efficiencies,
but it also serves businesses really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we think the future of it is the
potential for information sharing where
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses and technological solutions
that are contributing or participating in
[SPEAKER_04]: the platform can co-create value with one
another along the entire supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it comes to ways in which we're
creating efficiency, in supply chains,
[SPEAKER_04]: first and foremost, the data that's
collected in track and trace systems is
[SPEAKER_04]: intended to be collected during the normal
course of business when businesses are
[SPEAKER_04]: collecting data that's important for
making business decisions anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then second, because there's been
somewhat of a reluctance from very large
[SPEAKER_04]: technical companies to get involved in the
canvas industries, but in particular in
[SPEAKER_04]: North America and in the US where it's
still illegal federally, there's been a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of innovation and a lot of new tech
startups that are providing a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: services to businesses to help streamline
some of the reporting requirements that go
[SPEAKER_04]: to the government, but also be able to
streamline and better inform business
[SPEAKER_04]: decisions that they make throughout the
entirety of the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it ends up being an ecosystem of data
collection that's capable of being shared
[SPEAKER_04]: amongst many different actors within the
system.
[SPEAKER_06]: To sort of build off that notion of the
tech ecosystem within an organization,
[SPEAKER_06]: the one thing that I've noticed compared
to different industries, and we work in
[SPEAKER_06]: other industries, is that the tech setup
at cannabis companies can get a little
[SPEAKER_06]: overcomplicated.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are certain things that individuals
or business owners should be aware of when
[SPEAKER_06]: they want to get into a technology
package?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it looking at the ecosystem that it
plays with?
[SPEAKER_06]: Integrations, are those important?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can just build a little bit on
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we actually see both.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see businesses that are still
collecting or contributing to data via
[SPEAKER_04]: spreadsheets or even handwriting and then
later adding it into a system,
[SPEAKER_04]: and other companies that have pretty
sophisticated internal systems that they
[SPEAKER_04]: use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because it's important to create
efficiencies within the marketplace,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of businesses have worked with their
software providers to actually integrate
[SPEAKER_04]: in with the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, in our system,
there's been over 500 companies that
[SPEAKER_04]: integrate with metric to either to grab
information and get it out of our system,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also to put information back into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's talk about automation a
little bit, shall we?
[SPEAKER_06]: So what trends and evolutions are we going
to be able to see how cannabis producers
[SPEAKER_06]: actually produce cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can touch on that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, the automation in the
cannabis industry is, I would say still in
[SPEAKER_05]: its nascent form, because the industry
itself is still kind of figuring things
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to Lewis's point, how we've seen some
companies be no lightly software driven
[SPEAKER_05]: and some being very heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say right now, there's a pretty
high variability in how much people use
[SPEAKER_05]: automation to manufacture finished goods.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it plays into the fact that there's so
much change in what the end product is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be that it's not like a
traditional manufacturing and not
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional automation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where you can build these huge facilities
that are going to pump out hundreds of
[SPEAKER_05]: thousands of units an hour, because
there's no volume that's like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we're going to start seeing
automation that pops up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's things that we make, where all of
the devices are made for high variability,
[SPEAKER_05]: because this plant is something that we're
still discovering.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still trying to understand what are
going to be the staple skews in every
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are going to be the staple skews in
every market?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're also going to start seeing them
become smarter.
[SPEAKER_05]: So less like dumb automation that's huge
and massive treadmills of products coming
[SPEAKER_05]: down the line, and more small variable IoT
systems, like everything that we make is
[SPEAKER_05]: built off of a database.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all that database is going to be
synced with the ERP system of the company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's going to be synced with
metric.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to be a much smarter
manufacturing, because we're not starting
[SPEAKER_05]: this industry in the 1300s or 1960s.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like we have the internet,
and we should embrace it as we are
[SPEAKER_05]: building out your automation.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's face it, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: People were still smoking weed 1300 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they still were smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course they were.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, good question, though, on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So talk about the automation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people in this room may have
cannabis facilities that produce,
[SPEAKER_06]: grow, extract, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are key data points they should be
looking at in their operation to inform
[SPEAKER_06]: them that maybe it's time to move towards
an automated system for production?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are those key data points that they
should be paying attention to,
[SPEAKER_06]: to understand that the ROI is real,
and it's there, and they just need to
[SPEAKER_06]: adopt technology to become efficient?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you speak on that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: So me and my team, we actually built a
cannabis co-packing company in Oakland,
[SPEAKER_05]: and ran it for three years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oakland, California, in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was surprising, because we were a
robotics company sponsoring the
[SPEAKER_05]: development of this Bay Area service.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were a service provider, and we didn't
use a lot of automation in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did it all by hand to make sure we
could understand what exactly the
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional market was doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then our decision making on what we
wanted to automate, what was the most
[SPEAKER_05]: important, was when the balance between
throughput and the ability to hire became
[SPEAKER_05]: so difficult that it made sense just to
automate things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the workforce, at least in North
America, Canada, United States,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the culture has shifted from
people wanting to sit down and do knockbox
[SPEAKER_05]: their joints and finish them by hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's difficult to hire for that position.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you get to the volume level
where you can't find another 20 people,
[SPEAKER_05]: then it's time to make the change into
automation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's most of the time better to do it
later, even though I would hope you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: buy my machine the first day you decide to
start a cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the best time is really when you hit
that breakeven point, that breaking point
[SPEAKER_05]: between can I hire more people and can I
maintain the quality by having a higher
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of volume.
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually that comes in the pre-roll
range if you're doing more than 10,000
[SPEAKER_05]: pre-rolls a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the co-packing range, like for jars and
bags of flour, if you're doing more than
[SPEAKER_05]: 3,000 to 5,000 a week, it just doesn't
make sense to do those things by hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: But along with the variability that I
mentioned before, you don't really know
[SPEAKER_05]: what you're going to do when you first
start.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen many cannabis companies,
Canada, the United States, they'll spend
[SPEAKER_05]: $5, $10, $15 million building out this
whole facility, having this whole idea of
[SPEAKER_05]: what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they turn on the lights and they
don't use half the facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or it turns out the market has shifted and
this product that they were working on
[SPEAKER_05]: just doesn't make sense anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the form factor has changed or this new
skew that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say start very slow,
look at that breaking point, and then
[SPEAKER_05]: automate aggressively from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and if you look at any industry and
the companies who are the most successful
[SPEAKER_06]: in that industry are the ones that have
been able to reduce the direct labor
[SPEAKER_06]: component the most.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the more capital-heavy, capital
asset-heavy your company is for your
[SPEAKER_06]: production throughput, the more
competitive you're going to be,
[SPEAKER_06]: and the more consistency you're going to
have, and standardization and product
[SPEAKER_06]: output, which is important.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, let's take this to mobile devices and
vape products.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Hans, what's the next step for consumer
interaction with their vape product,
[SPEAKER_06]: their vape mechanism?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, I would like to look at this a
little bit from a different perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: More from a distribution perspective,
maybe, for D2C products, which are sold to
[SPEAKER_03]: end users.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been a large shift over the
last two decades, I would say,
[SPEAKER_03]: from the digitalization of sales,
really, where sales shifted from brick and
[SPEAKER_03]: mortar stores, physical stores,
to online sales, which is really across
[SPEAKER_03]: all categories.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not necessarily specific to cannabis
or high-end vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in B2B transactions, for example,
a wholesaler today probably needs an
[SPEAKER_03]: online portal where his customers,
his retailers, can actually place their
[SPEAKER_03]: orders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, he's going to be in a very
difficult spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they like to place their orders
outside of the regular shop working hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's also consequences on D2C
transactions when you sell to end users,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is probably even more important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a fundamental issue, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which have arised through this
digitalization of sales, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, let's take an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say, Jürgen decides to buy a new
vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he walks into his favorite vape shop,
and, you know, vaporizer store,
[SPEAKER_03]: head shop in Tütling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's the sales guy behind the
counter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say his name is Dave.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dave shows Jürgen all the different
vaporizers that are available,
[SPEAKER_03]: the advantages, disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_03]: He tries to understand what Jürgen really
needs and wants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the end of the pitch, after 45
minutes, Jürgen has decided he wants to
[SPEAKER_03]: buy the new Pax vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the price tag is 250 euros.
[SPEAKER_03]: 250 euros.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jürgen has decided that's the one he
wants.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is he going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is he going to do before actually
finishing this transaction, completing
[SPEAKER_03]: this transaction, handing over the money
to Dave?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is he going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in the audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is Jürgen going to do before paying
actually those 250 euros in the store?
[SPEAKER_03]: No one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Check the price?
[SPEAKER_03]: How is he going to check the price?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to Google it, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would argue 80% of customers will Google
the price before putting down 250 euros.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what Jürgen does.
[SPEAKER_03]: He actually Googles the price,
and he finds it at 185 euros on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Dave, if he sells the device at 250
euros, he's probably going to make 80
[SPEAKER_03]: bucks on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say 80 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: To sell it to Jürgen to complete the
transaction, he probably needs to sell it
[SPEAKER_03]: at 190, maybe 200.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he makes 30 bucks, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dave is not very happy about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's spent an hour with Jürgen already in
his stores, where other customers are
[SPEAKER_03]: waiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he might reconsider actually
restocking that item.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in return, he's not going to place an
order to his wholesaler, and his
[SPEAKER_03]: wholesaler not going to place an order to
the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the end of the day, it actually
becomes a problem for everyone involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most large online retailers today,
they actually work with pricing bots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these pricing bots, it's a software
which basically tracks online pricing for
[SPEAKER_03]: a certain item, a specific item,
multiple times during the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what the software also can do is to
adjust the pricing for an online store,
[SPEAKER_03]: for the specific online store,
to actually beat the competitive pricing,
[SPEAKER_03]: beat the competitors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what this ends up doing is actually
downwards buying a spiral, where the price
[SPEAKER_03]: goes from 250 to 240, to 230, to 200,
and just keeps going down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a problem for retailers,
obviously, because they don't make their
[SPEAKER_03]: margins anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even that online retailer who might sell
it at 185 is going to make 15 bucks on the
[SPEAKER_03]: sale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that worse, the hustle?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of you probably from the United
States, where you got the MAP pricing,
[SPEAKER_03]: M-A-P, minimum advertised pricing,
if I understand correctly, you can have
[SPEAKER_03]: agreements with retailers where they
adhere to sell at a certain retail price.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they don't, you can send them
warning letters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something in Europe that's very
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called price fixing, and it's
actually illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's actually sanctioned with heavy
fines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's nothing you can really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's other ways you can come up
with to influence and impact that pricing,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really need to put a disclaimer here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The vaporizer brand I used earlier,
and the price is obviously completely made
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't take this too serious, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to illustrate the
fundamental issue of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's certain ways of how to control
that through selective distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave might be saying, I really like you,
Jurgen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give you a free grind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give you a cleaning kit and a
carrying case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're still going to sell it for 230,
and you're still going to make good money
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But different companies, different
approaches of how to actually tackle that
[SPEAKER_03]: problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, like Apple, they mostly
decided to sell direct now, where they
[SPEAKER_03]: might work with certain retailers where
they only give 10% margins.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't actually have the latitude
to play with the pricing that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, they would be operating at
loss.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a fundamental issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of coming up over the last 10,
15, 20 years, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's becoming more and more a problem,
and people trying to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_03]: deal with this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is an example of where certain
enhancements in technology is actually
[SPEAKER_06]: hurting the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're providing challenges,
let's call it this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's obviously also advantages
of digitalization of sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easier for people who live in the
countryside to get products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, we got a few questions from the
audience.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to handle those first,
and then we're just going to jump into a
[SPEAKER_06]: general Q&A afterwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for those who submitted
these questions ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: First question is, how will the vape
industry be regulated in Germany's medical
[SPEAKER_06]: market?
[SPEAKER_06]: So who wants to take that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the vape industry, of course,
if you want to be in the German medical
[SPEAKER_01]: market, you must have a medical device.
[SPEAKER_01]: And medical devices are strongly
regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And recently, we have strong regulations
through the new MDR, the medical device
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations from the EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we by ourselves, we have,
for example, next week, we have three days
[SPEAKER_01]: audit by the DOV.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: With two auditors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need ice velocity for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's highly regulated, and it's a
hurdle.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the one hand, once you have done the
hurdle, not everybody else can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look to the vaporizers worldwide,
Storz and Biglis is the only one who
[SPEAKER_01]: really has done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few are also claiming it, but they are
not available on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a constant effort you have to do
to be really compliant with a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: device.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is something different if there is
a medical device or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not only the device.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the whole management of the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, it has also proved that it
really has a therapeutic effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all this together is not so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can do it if you're a well-managed
company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's just build some clarification
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because a company says they are ISO
1345 or 9001 certified, it doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_06]: the product is certified.
[SPEAKER_06]: The product certification is a completely
different certification, like the UL
[SPEAKER_06]: certification or CSA if you're in Canada,
for example.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of those things that if you see
that a company is boasting that they're
[SPEAKER_06]: 9001 or 1345 certified, that doesn't
necessarily mean they're product
certified.
[SPEAKER_06]: The product is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure, being the ISO
guy in the room, that everyone knows the
[SPEAKER_06]: stipulations there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_06]: But 1345, I think it's important because
it is a medical device.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is delivering a... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 1345 is one of three things you have
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You must have the quality management
audited according to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the device itself must be according
to, depending which device you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, the therapeutic effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be proven.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So another... Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: So another question that has come up,
and maybe this is something, Lewis,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd love you to handle this one,
but how can software and hardware
[SPEAKER_06]: integrations decrease cost in cultivation
activities?
[SPEAKER_04]: Increase cost?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, decrease.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Decrease cost.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, my bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think there's a couple different
technologies that can certainly help along
[SPEAKER_04]: those lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, in our system,
we use radio frequency ID tags to tag
[SPEAKER_04]: every plant and then every package or
batch of product that comes from those
[SPEAKER_04]: inputs into the supply chain system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then those tags can actually be read
from a distance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of taking an inventory,
if you have just a barcode or a QR code,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can usually read one tag at a time,
and you have to get awfully close to the
[SPEAKER_04]: tag to be able to scan and pull that
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: With radio frequency ID tags, you can use
a reader that's going to be the same size
[SPEAKER_04]: as a smartphone with a handle,
and you can take an inventory relatively
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly, as long as you get within seven
meters of the actual RFID tag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can pull the information off,
and then that unique identifier that's on
[SPEAKER_04]: the tag gets you acquainted with all of
the data that has been added into the
[SPEAKER_04]: system from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just kind of put that in perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you had your phone with a handle on it,
and every person in this room had an RFID
[SPEAKER_04]: tag that they were holding up,
if you walked up this aisle and down this
[SPEAKER_04]: aisle, we'd probably be able to read most
every RFID tag in this, and you'd be able
[SPEAKER_04]: to do it in whatever the time was it took
you to walk around.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that all gets fed automatically into
metric.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I expand on that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, guys, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were this co-packer in Oakland,
and we started building a bunch of
[SPEAKER_05]: technology to help our customers and
actually help our in-house production.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we did a lot of hand trimming for
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when you trim cannabis,
as you all know, it doesn't always have
[SPEAKER_05]: the same yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some strains are a little bit larvier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some strains are a lot more dense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And depending on what strain it is,
the actual veg time and flowering time is
[SPEAKER_05]: very different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then to compound the complexity of
these different strains, some of them are
[SPEAKER_05]: more exotic, and some will go for
different pricing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you take all these variables together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we did is we built this very
awesome ERP system for trimming.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we could talk about later if
that's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important for people.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what it did was something very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you would give a trimmer a pound of
flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's say the yield from that flower
was 65%.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you give them another strain,
same trimmer, same process of trimming.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the kilogram yield from there is maybe
55%.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're getting roughly 15%,
10% less in this other one.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the pricing and the marketing and
the market pricing for strain number two
[SPEAKER_05]: is significantly higher.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as it turns out, it actually takes a
longer time to grow, like an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's 14 weeks compared to 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what you can do with technology
when you're actually tracking from the
[SPEAKER_05]: growing, the cost of the seeds,
the cost of the vegging, all the way until
[SPEAKER_05]: your final product, I guess, maybe you
don't need to go to flowering or your
[SPEAKER_05]: final packaging, but maybe wholesale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like finished product.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see what you want to grow over
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there is a trade-off there where
if something takes 30% longer to grow,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you have a 30% higher yield,
but it actually only commands a market
[SPEAKER_05]: price that's 40% lower than, let's say,
strain A, then you can make your
[SPEAKER_05]: optimization on what you want to grow
depending on what exactly your final value
[SPEAKER_05]: yield is for that strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something that only a few
operators I've seen in California and
[SPEAKER_05]: really the United States actually have
looked into.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the beginning of these markets,
margins are very thick.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so people are like, yeah, let's grow
whatever and sell it and flip pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as time goes on and strains become
more accepted and more common,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to want to make a marginal
trade-off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that changes the unit economics of
your business significantly, in the
[SPEAKER_05]: millions of dollars range.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something that I think
technology has a pretty exciting amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think not enough people are looking
at that trade-off, especially in the
[SPEAKER_05]: nascent industries, like early markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: They start looking at it later when all
the margins get crushed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you look at it earlier,
you can completely take advantage of that
[SPEAKER_05]: market pricing dynamic.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a question that came in around
crop steering.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how technology is going to handle that
or aid crop steering.
[SPEAKER_06]: So first, whoever wants to take this
question, please go for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But before we get into it, maybe we can
define what is crop steering.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone want to handle that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked with a lot of cultivators in
terms of their crop steering, mostly on
[SPEAKER_05]: the indoor side.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's also kind of interesting to
what I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have a few friends and colleagues
in California who are very sophisticated
[SPEAKER_05]: crop growers, especially in the indoor
space, where you can change the humidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can change the CO2 content,
the nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know several growers that actually
they'll grow one strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they'll sell it under many different
skews.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the phenotype expression of the
plant changes on the tops, the mids,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the bottom of the buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can start to change the yields
of your plants depending on what kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: environment you're subjecting it to and
how you're stressing it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can also change the phenotype
expression.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of interesting aspects of
crop steering, crop modification.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would say not many people,
really.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And is AI going there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what's happening?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm pointing out a fellow tech geek in
the crowd.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a smart guy with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So AI, we can rely on AI.
[SPEAKER_06]: And link into your crop steering brain of
a computer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to pretty much grow your
cannabis for you with no human
[SPEAKER_06]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_06]: With automated tools?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say eventually, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where you're getting to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the unfortunate thing is that many
times the growers look at growing as an
[SPEAKER_05]: art form.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's because of the
traditional.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that unfortunate?
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I would say for the future of
humanity, it is unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_05]: How?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if we're ever going to optimize
things, we have to look at more in a
[SPEAKER_05]: sophisticated, repeatable fashion and in a
scientific way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you're looking at it as an art
form, it's not repeatable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Art by itself is subjective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Art is an expression.
[SPEAKER_07]: So cannabis always be a repeatable thing?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's food.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, apples are different
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get a different apple in Arkansas than
you do in California, than you do in
[SPEAKER_07]: Spain, than you do in America.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm not really trying to get super
deep into it, but I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that I've been noticing
in the past couple of conferences,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I love science and I'm not denigrating
the science, and I understand that you
[SPEAKER_07]: want to be consistent and repeatable at
all times.
[SPEAKER_07]: But plants don't work like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would argue that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a garden at home?
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you use the same techniques all the
time for all your things?
[SPEAKER_05]: My garden is not as well defined of an
environment as I would like for me to
[SPEAKER_05]: create a repeatable fashion.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we're going to aggressively service
the cannabis market in a sophisticated
[SPEAKER_05]: way, then you're going to have to control
all those variables.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's controlling the genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's controlling the inputs.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's controlling the environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's also how you end up with only one
sort of banana and it's dying out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but you also have the most amount of
surplus food production in the world that
[SPEAKER_05]: humanity has ever seen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I just put it out there so we can
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I do love boutique cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can it all be boutique cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's not that many people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can grow a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can, but that's not really a
scalable thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to be able to service the
world's cannabis needs and destroy a black
[SPEAKER_05]: market that corrodes the fabric.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, one, you don't need to destroy the
black market.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can co-op the black market,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hire some hippies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get some growers who know what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'd be on your squad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I mean, I want the black market to be
white market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Secondly, California has supplied damn
near all of the United States for decades
[SPEAKER_07]: and decades before legalization happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think that it's a scalable,
like it's a problem of scale or it's a
[SPEAKER_07]: problem of we won't be able to grow enough
weed if we don't use computers or make
[SPEAKER_07]: everything exactly right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the challenges that I'm having
with some of this new fangled weed is it
[SPEAKER_07]: tastes horrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: It tastes like computers grew.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we're kind of off topic and I would
love to talk to you about this a little
[SPEAKER_07]: later.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we're running out of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please continue.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to be in a profitable business
or an unprofitable business?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's the decision you have
to be in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis has been the most profitable
decentralized business for decades.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: In an unregulated market.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it's unregulated, like I could play
my monopoly with no rules, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I love playing Monopoly with no rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always win.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we almost done?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got 90 seconds left.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any random questions from the audience?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Berlin from Denton's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And regardless of any representation that
we have or actions against you,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're doing is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say from the perspective of
someone who's worked at the state level
[SPEAKER_00]: and now federal level for legalization,
we would not have gotten as far as we've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten without vaporization because of the
stigma of the spell and the access to the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my question is, and those I think are
radical changes that have changed the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I know everyone here likes
smoking weed, the fact that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: legislate on without that was really
helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do you see a 10 years from now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we have little time, but like,
what's the change?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to be growing cannabis or
using cannabis in 10 years that maybe not
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone here is picturing?
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't hooked up directly to your HVAC.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, I believe in 10 years we still
will, uh, partially smoke weed and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of it will be vaporized a weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for the comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you received today, uh,
a char of dried flowers, you don't know as
[SPEAKER_01]: a patient, at least you don't know what to
do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a roller joint, but it's not an
acceptable medical application.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make a cookie, a tea, but really
the only validated version how to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, applicated is, uh, by vaporization by
a medical device.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, that was great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you going to say?
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris is going to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have a very quick question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you definitely going to extend your
license for the medic, uh, mighty medic
[SPEAKER_02]: and for the volcano in 2024?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm worried that the medical market
for flower would be otherwise dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have a vaporizer to
prescribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you may, you may, you would refer to
the deadline of the medical device
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course we are working in it and we will
remain in the market with a medical
[SPEAKER_01]: device.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yes, as you said, it's absolutely
necessary to have this option available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Stars and Beagle is still the only one
who is providing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it for the panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was, I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
