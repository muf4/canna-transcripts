[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Siva Lunni.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm based in Brussels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work for a public affairs and
communication consultancy called Hager
[SPEAKER_02]: Corporate Affairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my job is EU public affairs,
which means shaping and influencing the
[SPEAKER_02]: development of policies and regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: at the European level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do it in many areas, among which
medicine and cannabis, via what we call
[SPEAKER_02]: the multi-stakeholder approach,
which is represented by Medicine and
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Europe, which is the association
that Hague set up back in 2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this presentation, I'll just go
through with you on the role of Medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: and Cannabis Europe, our goals,
what we have accomplished so far,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in terms of political
engagement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, if you're interested,
you could be part of Medicine and Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we started back in 2019,
and in general when we look for projects
[SPEAKER_02]: or ideas in EU affairs, we always look at
what's the status quo.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, what was the status quo of
EU regulation in terms of medicine and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, which I'm sure you're all very
much aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would summarize with a word,
which is fragmentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will go very quick on this, as I'm sure
you're all aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicine and cannabis regulations are
quite different across member states.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are member states which are more
advanced on one part of the medicine and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis supply chain, and others are
advanced in other parts of the supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the European Europe is becoming,
and is on the way to become a leading
[SPEAKER_02]: market in medicine and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lack of a new regulatory framework
for medicine and cannabis not only poses
[SPEAKER_02]: hurdles to the industry, continuation of
our pharma, but also to the other aspects
[SPEAKER_02]: of the segment of what we call the value
chain, which are, for instance,
[SPEAKER_02]: the scientific and medical community and
the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all these segments are strictly
interlinked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the industry cannot develop in a
smooth way, then also these affect patient
[SPEAKER_02]: access to high quality and safe medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we said, OK, we have these hurdles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a gap at EU level of
representation of these interests,
[SPEAKER_02]: if we want to call it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we address that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how we set up Medicine and
Cannabis Europe, which is the only EU
[SPEAKER_02]: multidisciplinary coalition whose mission
is to ensure patients have access to
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine and cannabis in the EU.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our why is, of course, because of the
therapeutic benefits of medicine and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in the application on the
treatment of different conditions and
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, the lack of a
framework that can ensure that patients
[SPEAKER_02]: can have fair access to these medicines
across Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do we approach this jointly with
the medicine and cannabis value chain?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do we mean by multistakeholder
approach?
[SPEAKER_02]: It means that medicine and cannabis Europe
is a membership-based association.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in our association, we have all the
three main segments that we identified of
[SPEAKER_02]: the medicine and cannabis value chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the industry, we have the
medical and the scientific community,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we have the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a big pool of patient
associations from different member states,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we will see afterwards is also what
allowed us to gain the political support
[SPEAKER_02]: we have now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also what we saw lacking at EU
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we saw a lack of representation of
medicine and cannabis patients or a
[SPEAKER_02]: coordinated representation of medicine and
cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we started, we had this idea of
multistakeholder approach, different
[SPEAKER_02]: segments of the cannabis value chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we said, OK, how can we put that in?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we asked ourselves, we want to ensure
patients have access to medicine and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we need?
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we identified three pillars.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is, of course, from a regulatory
perspective, so ensuring that there is a
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory framework, a regulatory
framework for medicine and cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_02]: EU.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you are all well aware of all the
different hurdles that exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are just a few of them, of course,
when it comes to cultivation and
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to affordability of
medicines, that patients, what patients,
[SPEAKER_02]: if medicines are not affordable for
patients, they won't buy them or they will
[SPEAKER_02]: resort to other routes to get the
treatment and the medicine they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also when it comes to free movement of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there are issues of patients,
for instance, moving from a member states
[SPEAKER_02]: to another with a completely different
approach to medicine and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe a patient who could legally use
a medicine based on cannabis in one member
[SPEAKER_02]: state will not be able to use it legally
in another member state.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is also another hurdle, but there are
many more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you're all well aware of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have another pillar, which is
research and innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the main hurdles, especially for
the medical, for the medicine and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, is the so-called lack of
scientific evidence that we have and we
[SPEAKER_02]: hear a lot, also from policymakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so another point, another pillar of
our advocacy is to really promote research
[SPEAKER_02]: and innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Europe, as well as at the national
level, there are funding schemes,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also sure you're aware of that,
such as a rise in Europe, who allocate
[SPEAKER_02]: funding for research and innovation of
specific areas, among which health,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're pushing in that direction to
allocate funding for medicine and cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: In different ways, it can be research
projects on the application of medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannabis on specific conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, well, we are focusing
especially on conditions which are also a
[SPEAKER_02]: priority in the EU.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you do advocacy at all
levels, as I believe was at national
[SPEAKER_02]: level, you know what you want to say,
what you want to convey, what is your
[SPEAKER_02]: message, but you also need to know what
the other party and your interlocutor is
[SPEAKER_02]: willing to listen to and is willing and
interested in knowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a first step, we focus on,
in this case, condition diseases,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are also a priority at EU level,
cancer, rare diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that is already work
which is ongoing at EU level, and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: work where we see a role for medicine and
cannabis, and that's the route we take to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to allocate resources and funding for
medicine and cannabis research at this
[SPEAKER_02]: stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also had, well, of course,
clinical trials that are useful and are
[SPEAKER_02]: needed to build up the real evidence that
then would allow and accelerate the uptake
[SPEAKER_02]: of medicine and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a third pillar which,
if I would prioritize, would be the
[SPEAKER_02]: foundation on which the other two build,
and it's the narrative around medicine and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, which we are seeing,
and I think we also discussed it in the
[SPEAKER_02]: previous panels, we are seeing it
developing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think since we started three,
four years ago, this has already been
[SPEAKER_02]: developed in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not over, so this is one of the
pillars that we work on and on which we
[SPEAKER_02]: started with our policymaker engagement,
because not only we need a social
[SPEAKER_02]: dialogue, but we need a political
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when we started back in 2019,
medicine and cannabis was barely in the
[SPEAKER_02]: political discussions at EU level,
barely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you do not, when the topic you
want to advocate for is not in the agenda,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you have to put it in the agenda,
you have to push a discussion on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to make sure that the topic is in
political discussion, and that's what we
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted it first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that we got in our exchange
with policymaker is the importance of a
[SPEAKER_02]: clear distinction between medical and
recreational, especially at EU level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where we focus, we focus on the
medical side, we promote multistakeholder
[SPEAKER_02]: dialogue, and of course, another point is
not only educating policymakers externally
[SPEAKER_02]: to the value chain, but also educating the
segment of the value chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also another hardware that we
encountered, and that was also mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: by the panels before, is education and
knowledge of ethical professionals,
[SPEAKER_02]: doctors, nurses, pharmacists, which is
important and for which there is an EU
[SPEAKER_02]: angle that can be explored.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the three pillars of our
advocacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it all bases on a prerequisite from
our side, which is understanding what we
[SPEAKER_02]: mean by medicine and cannabis,
and trying to have an harmonized
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding as possible of medicine and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what we're pushing for at the
moment, and this is also one of the first
[SPEAKER_02]: actions that the EU is starting doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The EU cannot develop a binding
definition, but what the EU can do is
[SPEAKER_02]: providing and suggesting a harmonized
definition as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the bulk of our advocacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we had it in place, we said,
okay, to whom we address our concerns?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the EU, you have three different
main institutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the commission, you have the
parliament, and you have the council.
[SPEAKER_02]: And naturally, the first is the
institution we went to was the parliament.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the parliament is meant to
represent EU citizens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going there with the perspective
of patient with a value chain,
[SPEAKER_02]: but with a patient-centered approach,
which resonates very well with
[SPEAKER_02]: policymakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We presented a policy pledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took some time, but we managed to build
some support.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the second half of last year,
we facilitated the setup of a European
[SPEAKER_02]: Parliament interest group on medicine and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, an interest group is an informal
group of MEPs who MEPs meaning,
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry, this is the EU jargon, members of
the European Parliament, which are
[SPEAKER_02]: shortened MEPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: A group of MEPs who informally gathers and
focuses on a specific topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case is medicine and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have so far 36 MEPs from different
political groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why this is important?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is important because we don't want the
topic of medicine and cannabis to be
[SPEAKER_02]: polarized in the discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want it to be a broad political
support.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far, we have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will continue to increase and to
broaden the support.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a good start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And MEPs represent 20 countries,
which out of 27, it's quite a good number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you would ask me what the parliament
can do, what they can do to help our
[SPEAKER_02]: cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there are three main things that
they can help us with.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is facilitating multistakeholder
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we mean by that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It means that, as I said before,
to put a topic in the political
[SPEAKER_02]: discussion, you need to create the
conditions for this topic to be discussed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the conditions is to have the
key policymakers involved in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if medicine and cannabis is Europe,
just reaches out to member states like so,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say that the chances of success are
much lower than if any other institution
[SPEAKER_02]: reaches out to look for events,
discussions, front tables, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an important role.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is also what helped us,
we will see in the slide afterwards,
[SPEAKER_02]: making the first step towards this
multistakeholder and policy-making
[SPEAKER_02]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then again, support our advocacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the parliament has its own tools,
instruments to push a topic towards the
[SPEAKER_02]: commission and the other member states.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they also have all possibilities to
advocate directly and to support our cause
[SPEAKER_02]: and our goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they can broaden our social
dialogue and reach a broader range of
[SPEAKER_02]: audience that can be also fellow MEPs or
their constituencies and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these three elements are very important
to push our goals further.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one example, for instance,
is one of the first activities we did with
[SPEAKER_02]: them was to organize an event in the
parliament.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was last March, at the end of March,
when we featured the different
[SPEAKER_02]: representatives from policymakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had the parliament, of course,
the interest group, all the MEPs,
[SPEAKER_02]: and in particular, two MEPs who
participated in the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the commission, we had
representatives from two national
[SPEAKER_02]: authorities, France and Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The choice was not random, the choice was
on purpose because at the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: France was leading the council,
so the member state work, and now it's
[SPEAKER_02]: Czech Republic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's also through these opportunities,
we also create a network at EU level with
[SPEAKER_02]: the member states.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had representatives from the
medicine economics value chain,
[SPEAKER_02]: which also are members of medicine
economics Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have our vice president,
Jacqueline Potratz, from MAMACA,
[SPEAKER_02]: from the patient association, Dr. Babak
Baban, who is one of our scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: advisory board members, and we have
Finansel, who is from Sanity Group,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's also part of our board.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is our advocacy at EU level.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be a little bit different from a
more technical advocacy, but the technical
[SPEAKER_02]: end, what we call the so-called more
political advocacy, both are important to
[SPEAKER_02]: push a topic forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the end, it's the, how to say
it, it's the political, the more political
[SPEAKER_02]: level will give the direction to the
technical levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there need to be a push from both
sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, as I said, medicine economics
Europe is a membership-based association,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we invite everybody who is interested
in participating in medicine economics
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe to reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We welcome every segment of value chain,
so cultivation, pharmaceutical,
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine doctors, and patient associations
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, just a wrap up of what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we contribute to raising
awareness and shaping the debate on
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine economics, also with policy
makers, patients, and public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, being active in Brussels and
having a foot in Brussels allows us to
[SPEAKER_02]: have intelligence on what's going on when
it comes to medicine economics in the EU.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are part of a good network with
patients, with the medical community,
[SPEAKER_02]: and with other EU associations as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, our final goal and ultimate
goal is to shape the policy developments
[SPEAKER_02]: on medicine economics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are, well, if you are curious and
want to reach out to me and to have more
[SPEAKER_02]: information, don't hesitate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here the whole day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anybody, if we have time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more time Sylvia Aloui.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there are no questions at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was Crystal clear?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
Hi,
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if you're hearing sort of
anything among those EMPs about the
[SPEAKER_00]: prioritizing of medicinal cannabis with
everything that's going on right now in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean on the other urgent issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's say that the path and the work
with the political level of medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, it's at an early stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we are now focusing on and also what
we are focusing on via the EMPs and with
[SPEAKER_02]: the EMPs is on, as I said, building this
political discussion, making sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: this is something that is discussed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And currently, we also follow in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: The developments more from a regulatory
perspective at European Medicine Agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that has been going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, of course, the current topics are
very important and are taking over,
[SPEAKER_02]: but are not taking over only cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are taking over many other topics also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other topics I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's say that the early stage of the
discussion on medicinal cannabis allows us
[SPEAKER_02]: still to have room for to do what we have
to do at this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the personal view on extracts and
the share between flour and extracts?
[SPEAKER_01]: To what is regulatory view on medical
cannabis should be in Europe only extracts
and not flour?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a position on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're pushing for is what we're
working on with the Commission is on a
[SPEAKER_02]: harmonized definition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the Commission has published a plan of
glossary where they also put down all the
[SPEAKER_02]: different definitions including extracts,
if interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can share with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is where we are at this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your current view on this issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing something in this area?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing any research on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are doing partially with our scientific
advisory board, but that is more on the R
[SPEAKER_02]: &I side.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more on the research and innovation
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not on the policy regulatory side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we come to an end, let me please
ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when we look on the international
laws, it comes to the point that any
[SPEAKER_03]: country having a medical cannabis program
actually needs a cannabis agency.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many European EU countries do you deal
with have a cannabis agency?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many EU countries have a cannabis
agency as a basic for medicine cannabis so
[SPEAKER_03]: far?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not many.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because member states are applying the
topic of basic cannabis in a different
[SPEAKER_02]: way, you will have member states which are
implementing the so-called pilot programs
[SPEAKER_02]: we have France for instance, we have
Ireland, we have Denmark which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: completely different approach than for
instance Czech Republic which has a drug
[SPEAKER_02]: coordinator or the Netherlands which has
an agency in swan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also the way member states are regulating
medicine or the way the structure of the
[SPEAKER_02]: governance of medicine and cannabis in
member states is structured is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that of course contributes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is something that at EU level,
the EU has not the competence to tell
[SPEAKER_02]: member states.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me please ask an additional
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Due to the UN treaty on drugs,
any country that has a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: program has to have a cannabis agency just
as an European agency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how come the countries implementing a
medical cannabis program do not open up a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis agency?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I remember in Germany before
anything was dealt with medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: here we had to open up the cannabis agency
and it was always a delay, it was always
[SPEAKER_03]: the reason that we do not have this agency
on a federal level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how come that countries implementing
programs just don't have such a thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a question I cannot answer but I
think there are also like there are always
[SPEAKER_02]: side ways on which you can deal with a
topic like amazing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot create a special program,
only a trial program and then if it works
[SPEAKER_02]: then we can see how to move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for instance the approach of
France.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
