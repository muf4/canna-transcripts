[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's talk about German social
clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is everyone excited?
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding is you can only join one
social club at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you could because in Barcelona I
belong to all the social clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, hey, don't steal our thunder.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not stealing, I'm just having a good
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, to lead us on this journey,
the equity partner at Hybrid Farms,
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis Education, and Medical
Partnerships at Loose Brands, all the way
[SPEAKER_05]: from Toronto, Canada, let's hear it for
Alex Ravitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, back in Berlin, ICBC, seven years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, we've come definitely a long way and
Willkommen, Danke für Riescheinung.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mein Name is Alex.
[SPEAKER_11]: I picked up a few things.
[SPEAKER_11]: Luckily there's translation for those that
don't understand us, but my name is Alex
[SPEAKER_11]: Ravitch, so glad to be here and I'm so
happy to be talking about this topic.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I had a tear in my eye watching
the videos of April 1st and the people
[SPEAKER_11]: celebrating and smoking joints in the
streets and it reminded me of Legalization
[SPEAKER_11]: Day in Canada, which was a bit different
in Canada because in Canada we had people
[SPEAKER_11]: smoking weed everywhere all the time
anyways, but here it was a very special
[SPEAKER_11]: day.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to introduce my awesome
panelists here and they're going to
[SPEAKER_11]: introduce themselves and then we're going
to jump into it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm very excited to be talking about
this great topic.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's get started with Tarek.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alex.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Tarek.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm coming to you from the United States,
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the Vice President of Global Sales
for a pre-roll company that makes pre-roll
[SPEAKER_04]: machines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still new in Germany, but the way things
are going, anything can change any day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really what I focus on is automation
and once everything kind of falls into
[SPEAKER_04]: place that you're going to want to make
mass pre-rolls and mass production of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis products, which is going to be,
you know, the most important way to be
[SPEAKER_04]: successful in a new and emerging market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, my name is Margaret, Margaret Knitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a German lawyer at the German law firm
SKW Schwarz.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a full service law firm.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I specialized in that cannabis
field in 2017 when medical cannabis became
[SPEAKER_03]: legal in Germany and we have our focus
group now with other lawyers as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an IP lawyer, but also do licensing
and also now talk about social clubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Stefan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Hamburg, Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of the founders and CEO from Hem
Group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hem Group is one of the leading CBD
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a lot of white label, private label.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have nine retail stores all over
Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the official partners from the
Süddeutsche Zeitung.
[SPEAKER_02]: We run a quite successful affiliate
program on the web domain from the
[SPEAKER_02]: Süddeutsche.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also a founder from Luxora.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luxora is a growth solution, a company
where we want to grow for cannabis clubs
[SPEAKER_02]: here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And beside that, I run Cannabis Social
Club in Spain for almost 15 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: for nine years in Barcelona and then for
like five years in Ibiza.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm quite experienced when it comes to
cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Give a round of applause for our awesome
panelists.
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Alex Revich.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been helping ICBC since the
beginning, 2017.
[SPEAKER_11]: And back home, my day job is I run a
company called Loosh Brands.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're an edibles contract manufacturer,
about 80 different products in the market.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know no edibles here yet, so we won't be
talking about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also have a pharmacy called Hybrid
Farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're the first and only pharmacy in North
America with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: So very excited to be here with you all
and to talk about this topic.
[SPEAKER_11]: And first things first, let's find out,
you know, what are the rules?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I always say we can't figure out
how to use the rules properly if we don't
[SPEAKER_11]: know what they are.
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe Margaret, if you want to kick us
off and tell us what are the rules for
[SPEAKER_11]: social clubs?
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we can figure out how we can make
some money in a way where you're not
[SPEAKER_11]: allowed to make any money.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all new.
[SPEAKER_03]: The social clubs, you can only start them
in 1st of July.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't really know what exactly we
need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only have the law so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there too, first of all, you need to
have an association.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the board members and the
representatives all need to have their
[SPEAKER_03]: residency in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't work if you live abroad.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the members of the social club also
need to have their residency in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only 500 members are allowed per social
club.
[SPEAKER_03]: The board members need to have,
they are not allowed to have a criminal
[SPEAKER_03]: record.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they need some kind of certificate of
good conduct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the other important thing to know is
only the members of the social clubs are
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed to handle the growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they do the growing process and they
give it to the other members.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you cannot hire some external guy to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything apart from dealing with the
cannabis itself, with the plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can hire someone for cleaning or
security or administration.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need some kind of expert.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually need to go through some
education.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of your members have to have this
title.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they know how to prevent harm from
others through cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you need to be 18.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're 18, you get 30 grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say 25 grams maximum.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have it per day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or per month, you can get 50 grams
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of documentation obligations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very transparent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going to be a lot of
administrative proceedings there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to watch out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: You said about the training.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a very interesting one to know.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now what about types of products that are
going to be available that we know about?
[SPEAKER_11]: Like yesterday, we learned at the Global
Investor Forum about hash and live rosins
[SPEAKER_11]: are allowed because they're solventless.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we know anything else about other
products that are going to be allowed?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis and the hash, the raisins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no consumption, from what I
understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, that's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call them social club.
[SPEAKER_03]: But actually, it's not so social there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of an anti-social social club.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not at all social there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not allowed to consume it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're only allowed to consume it 100
meters away from the club itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's not comparable to the system
we had in Sweden.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you have to actually roll your own
joints, which is unfortunate because
[SPEAKER_11]: Tarek's machine would have really come in
handy there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also too, I wanted to add,
it's a little bit confused for the most
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since the 1st of April, we have this kind
of legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to call it legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody asks me, yeah, now we can
open up a club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we can get our weed from the club.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: The clubs can apply from 1st of July for
the license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will also take some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even there are other people saying,
okay, 1st of July, all the clubs will
[SPEAKER_02]: start.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, 1st of July, you can apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this will take, let's say,
three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 1st of October, you can start with your
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means... If it goes through.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it goes through, maybe it takes a bit
longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the law, it says they can take three
months to answer to your request.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I say to everybody right now,
I don't see it realistically that the
[SPEAKER_02]: clubs will hand out weed to the members in
2024.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because from the timing, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to go really on the best way
possible to have product available in the
[SPEAKER_02]: clubs end of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't see that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that brings up a really important
question.
[SPEAKER_11]: How many clubs do we expect in the first
year?
[SPEAKER_11]: We did the math yesterday.
[SPEAKER_11]: Beau Whitney was kind of doing an analysis
of how many clubs he expects.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's quite conservative with a low number.
[SPEAKER_11]: But with so many people using cannabis in
Germany, we thought we would have a ton of
[SPEAKER_11]: social clubs.
[SPEAKER_11]: But now with all these challenges and
obstacles, can anyone throw out some
[SPEAKER_11]: estimates of what we think there might be?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking in the beginning,
it will be like a wild, wild west ride in
[SPEAKER_02]: the next couple of months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say a lot of people will try
to open up grow clubs or cannabis clubs,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's call it cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we will see that it's not that
easy to run a successful cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say we will see a lot of
activism clubs or friendship clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the other hand, we will also
see some professional running clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in the next two or three
years, we will have up to 2,000,
[SPEAKER_02]: 15,000, 2,000, 3,000 professional running
clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the more interesting clubs for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to that, we will have all
kinds of variation of clubs, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say maybe we have 10,000 clubs
within the next two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's very bullish.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look into the Hout Club study,
they say there are up to four million
[SPEAKER_02]: people who consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you look at the heavy
consumers, like I don't have the numbers
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly in my mind, but it's about
800,000 to 900,000 heavy users.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have another additional half
a million frequent users.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's up to 1.3 million users.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the most interesting cannabis users
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: May I just like to add something?
[SPEAKER_03]: In the law, it also says in that respect
that the states, the provinces in Germany
[SPEAKER_03]: are allowed to restrict it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one club per 6,000 residents.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see if they want to, but there
might be a restriction in some states.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's only Germans that will be allowed
to have them?
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to be German, but your home
needs to be in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tourists won't be able to go and
partake.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also different than Spain.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder what kind of proof they're going
to require to do this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like one thing I kind of have to agree
with Stefan in terms of, I think there's
[SPEAKER_11]: going to be a lot more clubs and people
are thinking because what I learned coming
[SPEAKER_11]: here to Berlin so many times is it's very
hard to get cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know maybe if you know somebody,
it might be easy, but I can tell you as a
[SPEAKER_11]: tourist, I've traveled around the whole
world.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I've had more difficulty
getting cannabis at a cannabis conference
[SPEAKER_11]: than Germany.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think people are underestimating that
part of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there'll be a lot more.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the medical system, which is
still quite challenging, also has
[SPEAKER_11]: challenges where the stigma is still real,
doctors are still not on board,
[SPEAKER_11]: people are worried about it being on their
medical record.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I actually think people will be using
these clubs considerably.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I agree, we also need to stop calling
them social clubs until they can be
[SPEAKER_11]: social.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they're called the growing clubs
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to start changing that
after this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, something else interesting that came
up is also much like Canada, even though
[SPEAKER_11]: we're federally legal, every province has
their own interesting way of legalization.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're seeing that now here in Germany
as well, that this province might be more
[SPEAKER_11]: liberal and open minded to these clubs,
but other provinces not so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were talking about that backstage.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to kind of touch on what have
you seen, Stefan, and then maybe we'll...
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we saw it all when the law passed
through the second chamber like the day
[SPEAKER_02]: before with this protocol notice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion, this gives the
provinces some room to how they
[SPEAKER_02]: interpretate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some provinces will say, we don't mind
what we're saying because it's not in the
[SPEAKER_02]: law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other provinces like Bavaria will say,
we make it even harder for clubs because
[SPEAKER_02]: there will come some changes in the near
future and bigger solutions like our
[SPEAKER_02]: solutions, we provide like a kind of grow
hub.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this one of this protocol notice,
they try to avoid professional growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really think that's a good idea to
put everything in amateur hands and
[SPEAKER_02]: produce high quality of a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an interesting way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_11]: They think it's going to be safe by
letting some amateurs do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: From our experience in Canada,
we had designated growers.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I had an ability to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can grow myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would let someone grow for me,
but that was usually not very good.
[SPEAKER_11]: And people were waiting for legalization
to happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wonder how that's going to kind of
change things.
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other thoughts on the provinces?
[SPEAKER_11]: You agree with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess Bavaria will be very strict
about everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, the consumption is not allowed
in nearby schools or kindergartens,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they must not be inside or 100 meters
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after the law passed in Bavaria,
they build a schaukel.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's it in English?
[SPEAKER_03]: Something for kids to play on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone was talking about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they cannot consume it there now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I always teach my kids, whenever you
wonder something, follow the money.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wonder how much certain provinces
who make so much money on alcohol are
[SPEAKER_11]: really concerned that their alcohol money
goes down.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we've seen with legalization,
alcohol consumption goes down as much as
[SPEAKER_11]: 30%.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wonder if a lot of these people are
looking at that and wondering,
[SPEAKER_11]: hmm, we make this much money on alcohol,
now that cannabis is introduced,
[SPEAKER_11]: we're going to be losing a lot of that
revenue, and it's definitely not going to
[SPEAKER_11]: be made up by these clubs that are
non-profit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wonder if that's a factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, but this was a factor the whole last
two years, I would say, because the
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol lobby tried to do everything to
avoid this kind of law.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think not only did alcoholics,
also the pharmaceutical sector,
[SPEAKER_02]: try to make it harder for us that it's
harder to get recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody can grow their own medicine in
the backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think a big pharma like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, and alcohol doesn't like that either,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: What about other countries?
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that Spain, we were just in
Barcelona for ICBC, boy, is that a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's so crazy to think Spain does
not have legalization, but it actually has
[SPEAKER_11]: one of the greatest places of legal
cannabis I've ever seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they tell me, oh, we don't have
legalization.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, I come from a land of
legalization, and we don't even have jars
[SPEAKER_11]: of flour, we don't have places to consume.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys have more legalization than us,
and you don't even have legalization.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe touch on, I mean, you own some clubs
in Spain, just high level, for the people
[SPEAKER_11]: in the audience that might not know,
Spain, Malta, what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Spain is all operating like in a big gray
zone, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you mentioned, I like the Spanish
Cannabis Club model, because there we
[SPEAKER_02]: really have a social life, and I think
this is like a little place to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can drink your beer, you can drink
your wine, you can smoke your joint,
[SPEAKER_02]: and watch a football game with all your
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not like, even not like in the
Netherlands, where you're not allowed to
[SPEAKER_02]: drink beer and smoke a joint in the same
local.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Spain, because we are in a gray area,
you can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the downside in Spain is you cannot
grow legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more or less the same than like in
the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to, in the end, a lot of clubs
buy their stuff on the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if they try to set up illegal
growth, they get busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the clubs get busted anyways,
once or twice a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your business calculations,
the police will come once or twice a year
[SPEAKER_02]: and take all, they can get their hands on,
they take all the weed, all the money,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you open up next day with fresh
products on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, and is Malta the same kind of similar
of what is happening in Spain?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think Malta is more strict and
more like also in the German direction,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think it took them, Malta,
over two years to get the first license.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just happened like a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think Malta is very small,
so we don't have the same experience
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it will be interesting in Germany
as like one of the biggest countries or
[SPEAKER_02]: the biggest country in Europe,
what we will do here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it will be very interesting,
all these different kinds of business
[SPEAKER_02]: models that came up and then we will see
who find the best loopholes, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I would say we are totally happy
that we have now a cannabis law.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me personally, I think this is one of
the baddest law I could imagine,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's still the best cannabis law
because we have one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most countries doesn't have any,
so we can work with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm quite fine that there are a lot of
obstacles in the way and we can operate
[SPEAKER_02]: with obstacles.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it's too easy, then big pharma
jump in, big money comes and companies
[SPEAKER_02]: like myself, we have not that room to
operate anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no, we are good in finding solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will find solution for every
obstacle that's in our way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did it like the last years also in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still the same.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we will find a way, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Tarek, I know you like to visit these
clubs.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are some of the things you really
like about going to these clubs and what
[SPEAKER_11]: do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was talking with Stefan and Stefan
has more experience in actually running
[SPEAKER_04]: the clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just me as a consumer when I was in
Spain for ICBC Barcelona, there is a
[SPEAKER_04]: variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the comfort and the hospitality of
these clubs per se.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, like when you're talking about
hanging out, having a drink, watching some
[SPEAKER_04]: football with friends, that sounds ideal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even in California, you just have some
dingy dispensaries where you walk in and
[SPEAKER_04]: you feel like you're breaking the law even
though it's legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my advice for all the social clubs is
just try to make it as welcoming as
[SPEAKER_04]: possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just changing that stigma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the dispensaries in California,
you have grandmothers and grandfathers
[SPEAKER_04]: that go into them and they won't go into
the ones that are super dark and scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's bright lights and colors and
just kind of normalizing, I think that's
[SPEAKER_04]: an important part for even the officials
in government to see that this isn't some
[SPEAKER_04]: shady drug business.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just normal, just like going to
grab a beer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's very important to be very
welcoming.
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually saw one of my favorite clubs in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_11]: Choco Cedric is here from there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's very bright and welcoming.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was nice to see locals there and
tourists intermingling, kind of getting to
[SPEAKER_11]: know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I almost feel bad that the locals come.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're like, well, what's with these
lineups?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's spannibus, of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when we think about why these clubs
are like in Canada, people are like,
[SPEAKER_11]: why are they doing it like this?
[SPEAKER_11]: They're so confused.
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I always have to explain to them
is that these are ways of getting around
[SPEAKER_11]: these European Union conventions.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the European Union and the UN,
they're very strict.
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I got to point out our Prime
Minister in Canada, Justin Trudeau,
[SPEAKER_11]: who's not very popular, most of the people
that I know, but he did say something the
[SPEAKER_11]: other day that was important.
[SPEAKER_11]: He said that the United Nations have not
even said a word about our legalization
[SPEAKER_11]: because everyone was like, well,
you know, what happened?
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone was all scared that, you know,
we legalized and the UN was going to come
[SPEAKER_11]: after us.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he suggested that we never even got
any letters.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now it came out that apparently a letter
was sent.
[SPEAKER_11]: He must have just shredded it and didn't
read it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's important to know,
and maybe Margaret, if you can kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: touch on, or someone else, you know,
why are the clubs the way we do it and how
[SPEAKER_11]: is the EU, how is this kind of around the
EU and kind of how is it skirting around?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually, back then when our traffic
coalition came here into Germany,
[SPEAKER_03]: they actually had their different view of
how to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were thinking, maybe a bit like
Canada, thinking about chains,
[SPEAKER_03]: their distribution chains, commercial
supply chains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what they said when they all
started.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then they looked into the law,
found, as you said, the EU conventions,
[SPEAKER_03]: there are three, and they went back to the
European Union, the Commission,
[SPEAKER_03]: and tried to find a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were very critical there,
and they didn't approve it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the end, what we have now is a
compromise.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a partly legalization,
as you already said.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it at home and with the social
clubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the future, but it's already in the
law, this is a plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second pillar, they say, they will
have models.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will try to establish the supply
chains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they will make research with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, yeah, that's what we plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know anything about that yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just there in the law that they are
planning that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have no details on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is first pillar, the very
start.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's within the laws, how we can do
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's interesting, Switzerland,
they were one of the only ones who kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: did a different thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have these pilot projects that are
also broken up by provinces.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wonder if they're also going to go the
social club way.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if they've kind of been
speaking about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it'll be interesting to see,
at the end of all these consultations,
[SPEAKER_11]: if they're going to go that way too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you have any thoughts on
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we're going to open it up to some
questions early, because I feel like
[SPEAKER_11]: there'll be some questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have more questions if you don't.
[SPEAKER_11]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Stefan, what do you think about
Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, at least in Europe,
looks about us, about Germany,
[SPEAKER_02]: how we will do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will do some mistakes for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will look at us, how we handle
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in theory, the clubs has to be
non-profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are ways to make profit with
clubs, even when they are non-profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be creative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you recommend to anybody in the
audience who's considering opening a
[SPEAKER_04]: social club or a consumption club in
Germany, do you think now is a good time
[SPEAKER_04]: to jump in while it's early?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it's still too many loopholes that you
don't really know yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on how deep are you in the
topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to know the law quite good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to already have some loopholes in
mind with who you work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't say it's a good idea or a
bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say even if you start in half a
year or a year, you can be successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have already your business
model in mind, start now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are ways, though, even though
it's non-profit, like you said,
[SPEAKER_04]: what you kind of do in Spain, even with
the 100 meters, you cannot consume within
[SPEAKER_04]: 100 meters?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in public.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that means when you have a non-public,
let's say, restaurant, a smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: restaurant next to a cannabis club,
you can consume there because this is not
[SPEAKER_02]: public.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have to look out about the
non-smoking regulation in all parts of the
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have the cigar clubs, the
gentleman clubs and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you can smoke cigars.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you can also smoke cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Bavaria, I know they have a stricter
regulation when it comes to smoking clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it would be more hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will see a real variety of
landscape in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some provinces, you can do a lot more
than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: In all kinds, not just for the clubs,
also for consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really important to have
consumption rooms for the members,
[SPEAKER_02]: because this is what they're like in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who consume there, and my
employees, they see if somebody has a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem with their consumption,
then they can start to speak about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all this regulation that we have
this drug police officer in this club,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the people don't smoke there,
so you don't see who has a problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: And people ask, should I get into this?
[SPEAKER_11]: I say, do you love cannabis?
[SPEAKER_11]: And do you have a stomach for the stress
of being in a new regulatory environment?
[SPEAKER_11]: Which, of course, the cannabis can help
with.
[SPEAKER_11]: And by the way, people talk about how it's
a non-profit.
[SPEAKER_11]: We like to joke in Canada that all our
businesses in Canada are non-profit.
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I do see someone in the audience
who does pretty well.
[SPEAKER_11]: But in general, most of our businesses are
non-profit, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_11]: The only person that really makes a lot of
profit in Canada is the government,
[SPEAKER_11]: but we won't get into that.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a different topic for another day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, we definitely have some more
questions for the audience, but I feel
[SPEAKER_11]: like people out there want some questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: Does anyone have any questions,
and Guy, you want to ask?
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, if not, I have more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, does anyone have any questions?
[SPEAKER_11]: I had a feeling it was a hot topic with
lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: You said that people, to join a club,
you cannot have a criminal record.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not when you join a club, when you are a
board member of the club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for the board member.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please be brief.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please be brief.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are talking about the cannabis
clubs in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the base for these cannabis clubs
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are forgetting here in Germany,
not only the social, that that's very
[SPEAKER_01]: important, but what you do with the
social, because you educate people
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout these cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people stay there, consume there,
they can also stop quitting smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: The association can advise them to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, association can be the best way to
do campaigns in the prevention in the risk
[SPEAKER_01]: of use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Germany is not doing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I think everyone here agrees.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is a step in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is federally legal, where in
Spain, as great as that is, they buy the
[SPEAKER_11]: product from the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's kind of a mix would be the right
answer, I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if there are any quality
control requirements for the cannabis that
[SPEAKER_00]: is produced in the social club?
[SPEAKER_11]: That is an excellent question,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you know how this testing will be
organized?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the responsibility of governmental
institutions?
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually meant to bring it up because,
yes, we know that there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot of regulatory compliance and reporting
at the club.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't need software for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what about... We are waiting for this
kind of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, until the 1st of July,
when we all can apply for the license,
[SPEAKER_02]: we know that topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We speak about that prior to the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about testing and all that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's critical because... Expensive,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_11]: We test each product three times in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if you have this small club,
maybe they have like a special genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: specimen strength and they have just a
yield from 100 gram, let's say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how much from this 100 gram you want
to take apart for testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you asked the laboratory,
they said, yeah, I need 50 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you give away half of your harvest for
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a good idea, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the law, it does say that the
authorities are allowed to go in there and
[SPEAKER_03]: make testings, but not very specific.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Engayo is available for testing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You took my line!
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, yes, I'm available to
help test.
[SPEAKER_05]: My rates are very reasonable.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't even take you 50 grams,
like three grams.
[SPEAKER_10]: That seems reasonable to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Kind of a two-part question.
[SPEAKER_10]: One, can you kind of outline what the
clubs would look like here in Germany as
[SPEAKER_10]: far as the relationship between the
physical location as well as the grow
[SPEAKER_10]: facilities?
[SPEAKER_10]: And then my second part has to do with the
point you brought up with the kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: having almost like a separate business
that would be a place that's private where
[SPEAKER_10]: you can consume cannabis on site as almost
like a sister company to the collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some ideas to have like a separate
business for consumption room next to it
[SPEAKER_02]: or something like that.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first question, where you grow and
where the association is placed does not
[SPEAKER_03]: have to be at the same spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that was your first question.
[SPEAKER_11]: Keep an eye on the Luxora website.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure there will be some more info
about that soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it need to be in the same state or
same province?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can get it from anywhere as long as
it's obviously within Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just has to be in Germany and you can
produce in one province and your
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's be honest, with the open borders in
Europe, it's going to be very interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you can literally get in your car
and drive to a different country and
[SPEAKER_11]: they'll say, hey, where'd you get it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, I'm a member of this club.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's going to be very interesting.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a medical prescription and I'm
driving to France.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you get arrested in France with your
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_11]: With your medical prescription from
Germany.
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, again, different topic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Apologies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Another question.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking cannabis girl clubs.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to know if it's possible to
open social clubs in the form as a brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that you can open multiple
social clubs in multiple cities,
[SPEAKER_09]: for example.
[SPEAKER_09]: Would that be possible?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can one person own multiple clubs in
theory?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: No person can own a club.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an association.
[SPEAKER_02]: The association owns to do themselves and
branding and marketing is a critical topic
[SPEAKER_02]: because you are not allowed to market at
all when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to see what would be possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are people to find your club if you're
not allowed to market?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they just use the force?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we have in Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can't market our cannabis either,
technically, but we find creative ways of
[SPEAKER_11]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We call it education, by the way.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so there was a dispensary in
Colorado because you're not allowed to
[SPEAKER_05]: advertise so they would advertise the
businesses next to them, like,
[SPEAKER_05]: hey, if you want to get a haircut,
come here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right next door to the cannabis
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've seen that in Canada, too,
actually.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a pretty good idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: And by the way, on that note... And it
helps the whole community.
[SPEAKER_11]: We didn't touch on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't be a member of multiple clubs,
technically, but I think fake ID sales are
[SPEAKER_11]: going to be very popular here in Germany
because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you need the fake idea
because you just declare that you're just
[SPEAKER_02]: a member of one club.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government doesn't check it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_12]: So my question would be more for Margaret.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think she should understand here the
most about the German laws and how this
[SPEAKER_12]: will work.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for investors now who always,
you know, to create those cannabis clubs,
[SPEAKER_12]: just to be kind of clear what the
regulation will be exact, like line after
[SPEAKER_12]: line, how we can grow fertilizers,
you know, all the technique where we can
[SPEAKER_12]: invest like all this money is big money.
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to be sure about this.
[SPEAKER_12]: And when this is going to be sure,
this on July 1st, do the German government
[SPEAKER_12]: will say this and this and this for the
clubs, exact, this and this you can grow,
[SPEAKER_12]: dead and dead.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or my lawyer said that, oh, we will just
allow this and then we will wait and then
[SPEAKER_12]: we will catch some bigger facilities and
then we will interpretate the law.
[SPEAKER_12]: And then through these interpretations,
we're going to find out.
[SPEAKER_12]: I get your point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see the frustration there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel with you, but actually this is
quite common in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the law and how you interpret it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not in other countries like the US or
UK is different, but in Germany,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's all jurisprudence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the end, it will take some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things you will try it out with your
lawyers, then it will go to court and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you get a decision.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry, but this is how Germany is
and then it will get more and more defined
[SPEAKER_03]: and through the years, you will have more
knowledge how the system works.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the beginning, we have a very
abstract, not so specific law,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the case in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like all our laws.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess you need a good lawyer is what
she's saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: She knows a good lawyer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Very vague laws that are up to
interpretation is really how this is done.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you find the creative ways to
interpret them and then you challenge
[SPEAKER_11]: them.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how we build an industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you will see what will work in
the north of Germany will probably will
[SPEAKER_02]: not work in the south of Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you will have slightly different
interpretation of the law in all the
[SPEAKER_02]: provinces.
[SPEAKER_02]: The autobahn is going to be busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you can get there fast.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a member of the social club,
you have to give your private information.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you expect from the German police that
they will have more control, like sitting
[SPEAKER_08]: around the social club and have like drug
tests when you drive a car because it
[SPEAKER_08]: stays in your blood several days?
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of the member will be afraid to
give their information about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they did the same now with the
social club.
[SPEAKER_11]: Testing for drug impairment while driving
is a very big challenge.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have this in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't test blood because it lasts so
long in your blood.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I smoke cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tomorrow I drive my car.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't really have a test that says you
are high right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, there is a company called
Zentrella that has an EEG headband that
[SPEAKER_11]: measures your brainwaves and tells you if
you're high right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's way too complicated for police
officers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's talk about clubs.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I think we already cut a little bit on
that question regarding the advertisement.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the law says there's a strict
advertising ban on cannabis, but also the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the line?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what is information and what is
considered advertisement?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we allowed to have a website or like
where do we cut the line of advertising?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what is already happening now,
if you just want to provide education.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do have already cannabis clubs in
Germany and they have a website and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can provide information on cannabis and
side effects, but you're not allowed to
[SPEAKER_03]: promote the consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, what I didn't mention before,
when you give out your cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not allowed to brand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It must be a neutral package, it says in
the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, there's not a really clear
distinction.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're interested in this topic,
though, go pay attention to what Canada is
[SPEAKER_11]: doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have plain packaging.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of this boring regulations,
but we find creative ways to promote these
[SPEAKER_11]: products.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just don't call it promotion.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we call it education.
[SPEAKER_11]: We find other ways of doing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So follow Canada or reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll give you some links to kind of give
you an idea of what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait a second, up at the top, there's
someone waiting for a long time.
No?
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we'll be outside the hall.
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy to answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: One would be... Frederick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it work now?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to know if you know that if
several clubs can share one production
[SPEAKER_07]: site, that's the first question.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other one would be, could you
clarify a little bit about the taxation?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, taxes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wait, they're not going to tax this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they?
[SPEAKER_04]: No taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say no taxes, no profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it depends a little bit how you
structure your association a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was the first part of the...
Well, that's your part.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can grow for several social clubs.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say you cannot share anything with
other clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot share, like, drying rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cannot share flowering rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how I read it, everything has to be
separate.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are out of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry we couldn't get to all of your
questions, but what a fantastic... Let's
[SPEAKER_05]: hear it for this entire panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was super informative.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure you can mob them as soon as
they walk outside the door and ask them
[SPEAKER_05]: more questions en masse as a team in a
variety of different languages.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to go to lunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one hour.
We'll be back.
