[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing should be clear right now,
Canvas is highly complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulatory environment is
ever-changing, and we need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiating our products against it,
and success is most likely to achieve by
[SPEAKER_00]: being meticulous about identifying
potential risk and opportunities,
[SPEAKER_00]: and by being always up-to-date with the
latest regulatory developments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something we're going to talk
about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three acknowledged experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right hand side, we have Mr. Kai
Friedrich-Niermann.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a specialized lawyer for Handbag
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kai is a member of the Cannabar
Association, an association for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyers, and works with cannabis companies
across the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kai puts his energy to sustainably
establishing the cannabis industry as one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most significant industries in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have Alexander Rieck.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the first entrepreneurs in
Germany to get active in medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He founded Kika Pharma in 2017,
and he was also a founding member of the
[SPEAKER_00]: German Association for Pharmaceutical
Cannabis, the BPC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have Mr. Peter Hohenberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a partner at Dentons, focusing on
life science with more than 30 years of
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, and he's the head of the
European Cannabis Group at Dentons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's one of the most renowned lawyers
in Germany when it comes to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a thought leader in regulatory
matters, especially in regard to medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Peter, let's get started with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the biggest regulatory
uncertainties and challenges producers,
[SPEAKER_00]: importers, and wholesalers of medicinal
cannabis face?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you give us a quick update on the
medical cannabis ecosystem?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the latest changes in legislation
and jurisdiction, not just the status of
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for your kind
introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very long question, and I can
actually speak for the next few hours
[SPEAKER_03]: about the regulatory environment within
Germany and Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to touch on just three
barriers, which I would say, in the last
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of months, I've talked about.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is with respect to the
production of the producers.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of new producers coming
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: In particular, in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have heard that this morning already.
[SPEAKER_03]: Producers coming from the European Union,
like Spain, like Greece, Greece,
[SPEAKER_03]: and other countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are also cultivators in other
countries outside of the European Union
[SPEAKER_03]: who wouldn't like to get their products
exported into Europe and into Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are currently facing a significant
issue, which is receiving their EUGMP
[SPEAKER_03]: certification for their products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those who are outside of the European
Union need to have an inspection,
[SPEAKER_03]: outside inspection of the facility in
order to get the EUGMP certification by
[SPEAKER_03]: the respective authorities in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: As due to COVID, currently we have travel
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have all this of different producers in
our countries outside of the European
Union.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are waiting for offices to come over
to their site and to get the respective EU
[SPEAKER_03]: certification?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will see, hopefully, once COVID has
been applied to a certain example,
[SPEAKER_03]: come these authorities.
[SPEAKER_03]: The import is of course an issue with
regard to consistent quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen the chart just now with
respect to where to grow, how to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not an expert in growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But from my point of view, from our
clients, is that indoor growing is at
[SPEAKER_03]: least the basis for steady quality,
which can be much more easily achieved
[SPEAKER_03]: under these circumstances of indoor
growing than in greenhouse or even
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with respect to the German monography,
with quality provisions regarding
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, the pH subcontent should not
deviate more than plus minus 10% from the
[SPEAKER_03]: registered limit, which is a challenge for
producers and even some producers who are
[SPEAKER_03]: currently exporting them to Germany may
have difficulties to really reach this
[SPEAKER_03]: plus minus 10%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but not least, the wholesalers,
we have ridden this one already,
[SPEAKER_03]: they are confronted with the price
erosion.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said, it's a price reduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a price fight right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The respective agreements between the
Health Insurance Association and the
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmacies to fix the price to a maximum
of $9.52 per gram of flowers, it was an
[SPEAKER_03]: indication of certain price control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see that even this $9.52 per gram
from the wholesaler to the pharmacy is not
[SPEAKER_03]: a technically real issue for this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time, we have seen rebates from
various supplies of wholesalers which have
[SPEAKER_03]: a significant impact and have reduced the
pricing significantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think these are the three issues which I
just wanted to touch on the regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe to Kai and Kai, what do you think
how strong is the need for harmonization
[SPEAKER_00]: in regard to PEP and cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what role do legal proceedings play
in this when it comes to harmonization?
[SPEAKER_02]: A big role, a very big role.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never underestimate the power of
litigation, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look back in history,
in 1996, there were the last reform in
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had a still stand literally
until 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 2017, Germany legalized medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But only due to personal, to a private
patient, litigating his right to form law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the court accepted this right and
granted him the option to grow his own
[SPEAKER_02]: medical at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the federal government said,
no, we doesn't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want the patients grow their own
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too much of a distress for society,
for police, for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make a law.
[SPEAKER_02]: We legalize medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a milestone, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in regard to hemp and recreational
cannabis, there's still a still stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until 1996, we had 2017, the last
elections.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last elections and the Green Party
were negotiating with the liberals and the
[SPEAKER_02]: conservatives for a coalition,
for the so-called Jamaica coalition.
[SPEAKER_02]: These coalition negotiations lasted four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the liberals said, no,
we don't want to govern.
Of course, we might govern falsely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's do not govern at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Green coalition came back and
another still stand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the last four years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we saw two important decisions by
the courts, by the ECG in November 2020,
saying the carnivore case at stake was CPD
liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ECG said, no, CPD has no high
direct properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the French government couldn't prove
any health risks for the population.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they said it's a free movement of
goods.
[SPEAKER_02]: The principle applies here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's legal in the Czech Republic and has
to be legal in France as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was also a milestone from the court.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had the hemp bar case here in
Germany in March this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because law enforcement said, you can't
give away any hemp product to the air
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer for consumption purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone else said from the business side,
lawyers, it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no misuse with the hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Federal Court of Justice said
then, OK, you can give it to the air
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer, which is a very big change,
also very big change.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, the question of the misuse of
intoxication has not cleared right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we decided to start a
procedure on the principle of free
[SPEAKER_02]: movement of goods.
[SPEAKER_02]: We applied for a general decree for a
client of us because the CPD flowers are
[SPEAKER_02]: very popular here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CPD flowers, they are legal in
Luxembourg, Austria, and Belgium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if they are legal in these EU
countries, they should be legal in Germany
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we applied at the Federal Office of
Consumer Protection for this general
[SPEAKER_02]: decree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was dismissed with this application.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we started yesterday, two days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We filed a lawsuit to the administrative
court of Braunschweig.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps me that the court will say,
OK, it's a matter of you being on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even better would be if the next
election outcome would be that we had
[SPEAKER_02]: another reform and liberalized these
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's get a question to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think what are the most
important questions farmers should ask
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves before entering the German
industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: From a regulatory point of view,
can you tell us something about the
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystems that are in place here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very important to understand
that the hand market and the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: companies market are totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should always be aware that you
have to prepare as well as you can before
[SPEAKER_01]: entering the markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there will be a lot of struggles,
or there are still struggles entering the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it will take some time to
regulate everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting better and better since 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have a regulation, and you should
be very well prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you need a long breath,
and it's not like running a sprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like running a marathon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Entering the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, the medicine market,
you also have to face a lot of questions
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding, or from your local authorities,
and registering the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is now more regulated
than the hand market, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should always think about that it
takes much time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much more time than you expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you said, there are two different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hemp, and there's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within all of that, there's CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter, CBD lifestyle?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you look into the CBD market,
and into the regulatory and liability of
[SPEAKER_03]: having CBD products, you can actually sell
CBD products in three different sections.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is cosmetics, including chicken CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second one is food supplements.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third one is pharmaceutical
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with regard to cosmetics, the
respective rules and regulations of the
[SPEAKER_03]: directive for cosmetics of the European
Union apply, which are not that strict.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you have to be careful with
regard to the CBD to be implemented into
[SPEAKER_03]: the CBD product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the German Alcoholics Act sees
it's much stricter, currently,
[SPEAKER_03]: than in comparison to the European
directive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here, the European Code of Justice's
decision, which my colleague just
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned, may help in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very clearly stating that CBD is not an
alcoholic.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has not been yet implemented into the
national laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will, but it has to be implemented.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shortly, at this point in time,
the German Alcoholics Act has not been
[SPEAKER_03]: changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: With respect to the food supplements,
I think that's clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: The European Commission very clearly
confirmed that these food supplements
[SPEAKER_03]: which contain CBD need to be registered
under the Northern Food Directive of the
[SPEAKER_03]: European Union.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have currently about 45,
maybe 50, respective applications for food
[SPEAKER_03]: supplements pending to be recognized as
local food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which includes CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but not least, with regard to
medicine products containing CBD,
[SPEAKER_03]: you need, as we discussed this morning in
the first part, market authorization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Market authorization for these products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to be careful if the
borderline between food supplements,
[SPEAKER_03]: cosmetics, and medicine products is the
medical plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a product, for example,
which is a Lysol supplement, you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: put it in the medical plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I've seen it this morning, Lysol is
using a cosmetic, which is CBD,
[SPEAKER_03]: and claiming it has a health, or is
improving your health condition to a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's helpful for skin infections that
would qualify that product as a medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have market authorization.
[SPEAKER_03]: The CBD market is currently different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's moving forward with the help of the
European Court of Justice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is definitely an advantage in
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kai, what would you say in all this
regulatory, crazy, Jewish ananda,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we say in German, what will the
elections play in terms of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: reform?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what factors could limit or destroy
the success of ongoing cannabis reform?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the elections will play a big role
this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are at a decisive point in time here in
Germany, as I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were still over two decades,
almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this year, Germany has the chance to
start reform in all three areas of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the moment, it looks like that this
reform will take place, because when the
[SPEAKER_02]: final results of the federal elections
will be here at the 26th of September,
[SPEAKER_02]: so in four weeks' time, we will see that
we will have a new chancellor,
[SPEAKER_02]: a new government, a new coalition,
new parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in every constellation, at least one
party, probably two parties, are for
[SPEAKER_02]: complete legalization of cannabis,
for recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all parties, even the CBU agreed at
the end of the last term of the bonus time
[SPEAKER_02]: that there is an opportunity for hand leaf
reform.
So there will be something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's urgent, because we saw law
enforcement actions since January,
[SPEAKER_02]: really strict and powerful law enforcement
actions, even against hand leaf key
trailers.
Hand leaf key has been in the shelves in
Germany for decades, and law enforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: decided early this year also to go after
hand leaf keys, because it's cannabis,
and it's not processed.
And from the diplomatic standpoint,
it's comprehensible to have a key and to
[SPEAKER_02]: go also after these products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are harmless.
Hand leaf key is a great product.
And we see that with everything.
You can make a discussion of everything.
Is it a CBD product?
Is it a supplement?
Is there a THC in it?
Is the THC product enough to be narcotic?
Then we have the ECG ruling, which helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a strong need for cannabis
reform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that the new government will
also take early steps right after the new
[SPEAKER_02]: government came in place for
decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very, very important point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should be the first matter of a new
government.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can agree on the rules for
recreational in the next two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But decriminalization will be a big
advance, a big step.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can talk about model projects,
or fundingization, and how the rules will
[SPEAKER_02]: work on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to add, I'm really here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hand key issues are currently on the
spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are representing one of the largest
total tea producers in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had a wonderful hand key in their
portfolio.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got a cease and desist from somebody
far more to sell it to anyone for two
[SPEAKER_03]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reason number one, it is against the law
to sell it B2C.
[SPEAKER_03]: And secondly, it has exactly the same
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was for pure help.
[SPEAKER_03]: No THC in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely no THC in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what actually happened, I think,
0.1, less than 0.1% use.
[SPEAKER_03]: What really happened was the federal court
actually decided B2C is possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my client said, oh, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then they, using an expert with this,
who actually stated that if you use the
[SPEAKER_03]: hand key leaves and put that into cookies
and bake it, it may have a billion,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it has a psychotic effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the court decided, OK,
we have to take that from the shots.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is something which is kind of
strange.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we hope that this is going to change,
in particular with regard to hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because industrial hemp, as we all know,
has been on the shelves, have been sold
[SPEAKER_03]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this shows this heterogeneous
environment which we are facing in the
[SPEAKER_03]: different areas of CBD products,
hemp products, and THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just quickly go back to Kai.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you say, if we get cannabis
regulation or regulation on cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, how would this affect medicinal
cannabis and hemp products here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, of course, this would cause a boom,
a green rush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hundreds, thousands of companies only
dealing with regational cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tax revenues and entrepreneurial
businesses taking care of the product
[SPEAKER_02]: quality and consulting services.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a great impact, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: As our panel before discussed already,
the medical cannabis industry will
[SPEAKER_02]: probably get another problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they always say they have a natural
advantage to the market because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: option of reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the public health provides.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we have to focus on real medical
purposes and the studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we need more evidence and more
data to ask people to study destination
[SPEAKER_02]: areas where patients can rely on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The normal patient probably would go to
the recreational market and get their
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine for their own therapy there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the market opened up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 600 to 800 tons of dried flowers
for the recreational black market in
Germany alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's lots of potential for that if
we have a clear framework how to sell it,
[SPEAKER_02]: how to distribute recreational cannabis to
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that both markets can coexist
because the first one is the recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it is regulated in another way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second one is that the patients
get the costs covered by the public health
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe the medical cannabis market will
be a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think both markets can coexist.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, of course, the public health
insurers probably ask, why should we pay
[SPEAKER_02]: such an expensive therapy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go to the next kind of subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, I think we should not underestimate
the need for a doctor when you're a sick
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely also think that a
medicinal cannabis still exists,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though we have a regulatory
environment for recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about regulatory in the
European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we have a free trade union here
in the European Union, unless we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter, what possibilities do you see for
regulatory harmonization at an equal
[SPEAKER_00]: level?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think we need to go back a little
bit in history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you may ask, what is the character?
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of papers does he have here?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a resolution of the European
Parliament dated on 13th February 2019,
[SPEAKER_03]: which calls the European Commission to
harmonize the European legal environment
[SPEAKER_03]: for the use of medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has not been re-recognized.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the initial step forward for
creating a new directive, which needs to
[SPEAKER_03]: be implemented in the respective
legislations of the EU member states.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has been published, celebrated by
the trade press as, yeah, we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably nobody has read it completely,
but if you look into those 18 different
[SPEAKER_03]: points, I would like to cite just two
points to make you understand where the
[SPEAKER_03]: danger of those revolutions is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Point number 12 reads as follows,
calls on member states to reconsider the
[SPEAKER_03]: relevant legislation on the use of
cannabis-based medicines, and scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: research proves that the same positive
effect can be achieved by using ordinary
[SPEAKER_03]: medicines that do not have addictive
effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something which is totally
contrary to the development which we have
[SPEAKER_03]: currently in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And number 14 is the reverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Calls on the Commission to work with
member states to ensure that safe and
[SPEAKER_03]: controlled cannabis used for medicinal
purposes can only be in the form of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis-devived products that have gone
through clinical trials, regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: assessment, and approval.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is not yet the case, as we all know,
with this product currently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it has extemporalizations in
Germany, and the pharmacist is going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: the hand-held effect, for example,
before he hands it over to the patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is no regulatory approval
necessary, no market approval necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as such, this is kind of dangerous if
the EU Commission will follow and
[SPEAKER_03]: implements the respective directive on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the industry has to work against that,
has to work with the Commission in order
[SPEAKER_03]: to have an environment, a regulatory
environment throughout Europe established
[SPEAKER_03]: which is for the industry and not against
the interests of the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: When this will be implemented?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: COVID has, of course, failed on each and
every process of the EU Commission,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they are not asked because,
you know, in general, but there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: process going on, and we have,
as an industry, to put forward our
[SPEAKER_03]: interests and to lobby the interests of
the respective industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only agree on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in each and every one of our
responsibilities to lobby for policy and
[SPEAKER_00]: to be there and to work together as an
industry so we can get more harmonized and
[SPEAKER_00]: also operate both regulatory and
regulatory framework where our interests
[SPEAKER_00]: are reflected in and we're not there
subtly in decisions that we have to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with that in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're almost at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one last question for all the
speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your personal message to our
founders and investors having a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis regulatory environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any comments on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, look at the rules, the state of
mind, but don't let them overvalue if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: too confusing or if it doesn't make sense
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing big to add, and I think you should
have very long breath, and you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make yourself available with the
heterogeneous regulatory environment not
[SPEAKER_03]: only within Europe but also within
Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different states have different views of
the others.
[SPEAKER_03]: This morning, what cannabis products are,
it has an impact on your business,
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course on any of the investments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as such, make yourself familiar with
all these different and heterogeneous
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have time.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a question right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, he's so excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't go through the sheets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I first heard rumors floating around that
Germany's going to limit the use of
[SPEAKER_04]: non-finished cannabis in the student
market here, as in non-GMP cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anybody heard about any who are with
that conversation blending or if that's
[SPEAKER_04]: moving forward?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have indeed currently a route of
cannabis products which are just GACP
[SPEAKER_03]: processed into Europe and into the German
market as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The products are then here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We find under EUGOT certification and then
sold into the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: The authorities are looking very closely
into this route because of bush safety,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course, is something which is top on
the list, and we'll see how the
[SPEAKER_03]: authorities will react.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are watching this very closely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the question is also whether these
products which are imported into the
[SPEAKER_03]: European Union and into that data into
Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know one producer from Europe via Spain
into Germany has been holding GACP
[SPEAKER_03]: processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a kind of a break zone between
regarding the drug process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pre-trial is allowed under GACP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, the further drug process is GMP
and would then require GMP certification.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a product which arrives in
Europe which has the ability of maybe 10%
[SPEAKER_03]: or less, that might not be GACP processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so only GACP processed is maybe also
GMP processed, which of course would need
[SPEAKER_03]: certification.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the entire EU is looking at that
or is that Germany specific?
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, I know the German authorities
are looking into that, in particular some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the lower pharmaceutical authorities in
the United States where the import is
[SPEAKER_03]: allocated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're so informative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, you've taught them everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's hear it again for the whole
panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
