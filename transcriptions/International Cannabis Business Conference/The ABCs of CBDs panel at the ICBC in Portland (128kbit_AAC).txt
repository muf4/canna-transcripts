[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so our next panel deals with a
very important cannabinoid, CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ABCs of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD may not be as fun as THC, but it has
great medicinal values and there is a big
[SPEAKER_02]: and growing market for CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will introduce the moderator who will
then introduce the other speakers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the COO of Siskiyou Sungrown,
vertically integrated cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a cannabis and hemp producer and
processor who last year had a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: field and adult use cannabis field and a
hemp field side by side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tongue twister there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we give it up for Mr. Michael Johnson.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to thank Alex for having us here
today and doing this panel on CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the CBD opportunity here
nationally, internationally, but
[SPEAKER_09]: especially here in Oregon is a really
special thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have some great experts on the team
today.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got Cedar Gray, CEO of Siskiyou
Sungrown.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cedar has been a pioneer in the Oregon
cannabis industry and in the CBD market
[SPEAKER_09]: for many years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Currently sits on the Oregon Cannabis
Commission and many other rules advisory
[SPEAKER_09]: committees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Next we've got Justin Tambay with
Phytonics.
[SPEAKER_09]: Phytonics specializes in CBD hemp seed
breeding, genetics, and they're a real
[SPEAKER_09]: pioneer in southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's been working to sell genetics and
cultivate genetics for companies all
[SPEAKER_09]: around the country.
[SPEAKER_09]: Last we've got Aaron Pelly with Cultiva
Law.
[SPEAKER_09]: Aaron's a hemp CBD cannabis specialist,
lawyer, litigator.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's based out of Seattle, but grateful to
have him here for the legal perspective on
[SPEAKER_09]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: As many of you know, the opportunity with
CBD is massive, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: confusion around this compound.
[SPEAKER_09]: Depends on what lawyer you ask,
what expert you ask, and often you get a
[SPEAKER_09]: different answer based on what you can do,
what's legal, what's not, how you can do
[SPEAKER_09]: it, where you can send it, where you can
grow it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm hoping that we can give you just a
rough outline of how to get into the
[SPEAKER_09]: market, how to approach it, and some basic
do's and don'ts.
[SPEAKER_09]: So first, when I researched CBD,
it's clear that there's a lot of confusion
[SPEAKER_09]: around is this even legal on a national
level.
[SPEAKER_09]: A national perspective and an
international perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Aaron, I wanted to know if you wanted
to jump in and maybe answer that question.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is CBD legal on a national level?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I knew you were gonna ask me that
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an interesting question, and it's one
that no real attorney wants to put their
[SPEAKER_03]: name on in its entirety.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's about as unclear as it could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have competing agencies, including our
Congress, who's essentially attacking the
[SPEAKER_03]: purse strings to prevent the Department of
Justice from doing anything as it relates
[SPEAKER_03]: to the Farm Bill Act, but the Farm Bill
Act itself was recently, this was just a
[SPEAKER_03]: few months ago, went to the Ninth Circuit,
where they were asking for some clarity,
[SPEAKER_03]: the same kind of clarity that they asked
for several years earlier, and got some
[SPEAKER_03]: clarity.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the Ninth Circuit came back was a
procedural motion, or procedural action
[SPEAKER_03]: that said that they had lost on their
failure to present this during the
[SPEAKER_03]: comments period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were barred from pretty much
bringing this action and getting this
[SPEAKER_03]: clarity, but they still threw some clarity
in there anyways, saying that the
[SPEAKER_03]: Agricultural Act did preempt the CSA,
which is the Controlled Substance Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was really good news, but then the
bad news was that it was an unpublished
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have the force of law.
[SPEAKER_03]: They literally put an asterisk next to it
saying it was a memorandum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is an opinion out there that says
that it is, but we keep getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: really negative feedback from the DEA and
the FDA saying that it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's about as clear as mud.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Aaron.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's a similar answer I've heard
from other attorneys.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's frustrating that we don't have more
clarity, but what's clear with Cedar and
[SPEAKER_09]: with Justin and many other companies here
in Oregon, they are having a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: success with CBD, grown in-state legal
hemp programs.
[SPEAKER_09]: One question I get asked a lot is,
what's the difference between hemp and
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_09]: And when CBD is involved, what's going on
here?
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's that line drawn?
[SPEAKER_09]: Cedar, do you want to give us just a
little historical background?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so there's multiple definitions of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very confusing right now for the
consumer and the market place,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's because we've got a botanical
definition, a historical definition,
[SPEAKER_06]: and a legal definition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Botanically speaking, well, hemp falls
with all other cannabis in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: family.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of two families in the, or excuse me,
in the cannabis genus, one of two genuses
[SPEAKER_06]: in the cannabis family.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other family, HOPPS being the other.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's fierce debate going on right now
in the botanical scientific community
[SPEAKER_06]: about the exact subdivisions of the
cannabis genus, whether indica,
[SPEAKER_06]: ruderalis, and sativa are different
subspecies, are different species,
[SPEAKER_06]: all belong to one genus.
[SPEAKER_06]: All belong to one species.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a current debate.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's clear is hemp and all other
forms of cannabis fall within the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: family.
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of the variation that we see in
cannabis plants throughout the world is
[SPEAKER_06]: due to thousands of years of human
cultivation, local natural selection
[SPEAKER_06]: pressures, combined with humans choosing
the cultivars that they wanted to
[SPEAKER_06]: propagate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so over the centuries, that's given us
a vast array of diversity within the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis family.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that comes to the historical
definition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Historically, hemp most recently has come
to refer to the cultivars of cannabis that
[SPEAKER_06]: were chosen for fiber, for fiber
production.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those cultivars had specific physical
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, however, all of that has been muddied
by the legal definition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here in the United States, it was started
by federal regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been mirrored by most states where
hemp is a cannabis plant that's certified
[SPEAKER_06]: to be less than 0.3% THC and is grown
under the proper regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it has nothing to do with historical
use or botanical definitions.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, the exact same plant grown under
the ODA, Oregon Department of Agriculture,
[SPEAKER_06]: or the OLCC would be hemp or not just
because it grew under a different
[SPEAKER_06]: regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is the somewhat murky answer to
what is hemp.
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we know there's a huge market
for CBD products within the medical
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis systems of different states,
within the recreational system here in
[SPEAKER_09]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_09]: We at Siskiyou Sungrown sell a lot of CBD
products in the recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: system.
[SPEAKER_09]: But now we have this national marketplace,
an international marketplace that's
[SPEAKER_09]: starting to explode with CBD products.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything from vape pens and capsules to
putting it into different food products.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the trends are really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, Justin, I know you've got some
insights.
[SPEAKER_09]: You were just at a show down in Anaheim.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm just curious what your thoughts
are on the evolving trends moving forward
[SPEAKER_09]: with the CBD marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really vibrant market that's not
going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to grow rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think sales this year were estimated
somewhere in the neighborhood of $600
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the introduction of the 2018 Farm
Act, even though that's not out of
[SPEAKER_00]: committee yet, it is in fact changing the
projections for market size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of years ago in 2016,
folks were looking at the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only a part of hemp,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a part of the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the CBD market has been worth
something like $2 billion, 2.1 in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now that's revised to be $22 billion
by 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the market forecasters are looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seeing the trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seeing that governments here,
both state and federally in the US and
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally, are making room for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis industry has,
as you all know, operated in the gray zone
[SPEAKER_00]: and the margins for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people here are entrepreneurs and risk
takers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the industry is pushing forward to
sort of make the changes that the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory bodies are catching up to in a
lot of instances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sit on the Oregon Industrial Hemp
Farmers Association here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we advise a lot of times the ODA and
the state about what they need to consider
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to approach regulating the
cultivation of hemp and the aspects of the
[SPEAKER_00]: byproducts that come out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back to the question sort of is it
legal or not, you have a federal
[SPEAKER_00]: authorized program that lets states set
certain regulatory frameworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Oregon, we work under the auspices
of this pilot or research program under
[SPEAKER_00]: the Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the template is out there
for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a big distinction right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly, we're able to cultivate a kind
of cannabis that's legally defined as 0.3%
[SPEAKER_00]: THC or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even that, there's multiple
interpretations of that as an agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in Oregon, that means that we can
have kids on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to have cameras everywhere
watching where the hemp is being grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: processed, stored, et cetera, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that already creates sort of a more
streamlined process and a broader access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're seeing a ramp up of production
in these high CBD hemp strains that is
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding this market and is going to,
is literally exploding in front of our
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do understand that there's a lot of
unanswered questions in the gray area as
[SPEAKER_00]: to the exact legality and the exact
mechanisms that we are supposed to follow
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to be compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will also say that the market is
active, that the businesses are operating
[SPEAKER_00]: in at minimum 38 states right now,
and that CBD products are being sold in
[SPEAKER_00]: all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And internationally, we went to Europe
last, well earlier this year in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring, and hemp cultivation there for CBD
is just starting to kind of catch on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis cultivation for CBD is just
starting to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been doing it for fiber and seed
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just went over to British Columbia for the
Pacific Rim Hemp Conference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have had something in the
neighborhood of 130, 140,000 acres of hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: under cultivation in the previous year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, mostly for hemp part seeds and some
parts for fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all trying to figure out how to
pivot to CBD production because this is
[SPEAKER_00]: where the lucrative part of the market is
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the market for even just CBD flour
as an alternative substitute or supplement
[SPEAKER_00]: to tobacco smoking products in Europe is
huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a big market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different ways that you
can participate in the market if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the whole value chain,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're just gonna see a lot of
diversification from beauty and healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: products to edibles and medibles and
ingestibles to, again, a more standard
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking market that is all happening
parallel to the existing cannabis markets
[SPEAKER_00]: and infrastructure that we're familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome, awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, the potential is just,
it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really exciting to see all the myriad
of products that are happening,
[SPEAKER_09]: all the markets that are opening up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's clear, though, that we need support
from our governments, both state and
[SPEAKER_09]: federal, to be able to expand this market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a lot of rumblings right now
in the CBD industry about the hemp bill,
[SPEAKER_09]: or sorry, the farm bill that's coming up
here in 2018.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a huge bill.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know how large it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: It encompasses all sorts of agricultural
issues in the United States.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I know it's gonna affect the CBD
market significantly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Aaron, are you able to give us a little
update on the farm bill and where it's at
[SPEAKER_09]: and how that might affect the CBD hemp
market?
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a joke by looking at my watch
earlier because it seems like we do have a
[SPEAKER_03]: pending deadline in terms of that coming
out soon by the end of this month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mitch McConnell's behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a very short time limit on one
side in legislature, so most people
[SPEAKER_03]: believe it's gonna go through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing
kind of remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the versions of the bill on one
side of the legislature doesn't allow
[SPEAKER_03]: felons, previous felons to be involved,
which really, the best growers of most
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, if they aren't felons,
it's practically a badge of honor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means you might have been better at
your job than others.
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly, excluding entire groups of
people based on what I consider very
[SPEAKER_03]: unfair new Jim Crow laws in the first
place are wildly inappropriate when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: excluding an entire group of people from
being involved in this market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see a lot of problems with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the big problem that everybody should
be scared of also is not just
[SPEAKER_03]: consolidation but the Coca-Cola
announcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these guys are telegraphing a whole
change in the market that doesn't include
[SPEAKER_03]: you, any of you, unless somebody's from
Coca-Cola here.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are gigantic companies that are
coming in that can deal with the FDA,
[SPEAKER_03]: that can deal with making claims about
whether this has some sort of medical
[SPEAKER_03]: benefit or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so every day in some ways I look at
this similar to what I saw in Washington
[SPEAKER_03]: when we had medical marijuana and that we
have this diversity of people that are
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in the CBD market that think that
it should be free.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people that are activists that are
involved in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people that are capitalists that
are involved in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that diversity of opinion means
nothing to the people that would move this
[SPEAKER_03]: forward because they worship one God and
that's money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we all have something to kind of be
afraid of because we have this mom and pop
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of effect going on that is
questionable whether we'll survive
[SPEAKER_03]: something that's going to be consolidated
under the federal government.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the versions of the Farm Bill Act
requires that the federal government does
[SPEAKER_03]: approve any state program before we're
involved, before we can actually implement
[SPEAKER_03]: that state program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, another fear could be similar to
something that the government does all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time, which is they create a bill,
they write something, and then they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: fund it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that that'll happen or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of, I consider heavy hitters
involved in this industry that want to see
[SPEAKER_03]: that bill go through and push forward and
see it funded.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I say, I look at it with some,
at least a measure of skepticism for what
[SPEAKER_03]: happens next.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, CBD is just, it's a compound,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can grow it in many systems.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cedar was one of the very first people
that I knew that was growing CBD-rich
[SPEAKER_09]: cultivars and making CBD products in the
Oregon medical marijuana program and then
[SPEAKER_09]: transitioned and began doing that in the
recreational cannabis program and is now
[SPEAKER_09]: doing so in the hemp program.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious, Cedar, maybe you want to talk
about what would be the advantages of
[SPEAKER_09]: going forward with your CBD products in
the Oregon Department of Agriculture hemp
[SPEAKER_09]: program rather than in those other state
licensed programs that you have experience
[SPEAKER_09]: in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there are multiple distinct
advantages.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's start with the regulatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: The regulatory framework of hemp
production under the Oregon Department of
[SPEAKER_06]: Agriculture is infinitely less complex
than farming under the OLCC requirements.
[SPEAKER_06]: That, you know, reduced complexity
translates to, well, profits and
[SPEAKER_06]: happiness.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, that's a huge benefit right
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It ties right into another great benefit
and that's the IRS tax code 280E.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, consult with your CPA about
this, but most hemp businesses consider
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves to be exempt from 280E.
[SPEAKER_06]: 280E is a tax code which denies cannabis
businesses most write-offs, resulting in a
[SPEAKER_06]: very hostile business environment in which
it's challenging to turn a profit because
[SPEAKER_06]: most of the profit is taken by the IRS.
[SPEAKER_06]: Comparatively speaking, typical business
run exactly the same way that's not
[SPEAKER_06]: subject to 280E might have four or five
times the profit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's move to the marketplace here in
the Oregon Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the cannabis market, it's not news to
anybody here that the market's flooded and
[SPEAKER_06]: prices are at an all-time low.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's good news for consumers,
consumers and patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't want to deny that fact.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think cannabis and hemp products should
be cheaper and cheaper forever for
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is a benefit.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it's a sudden shift.
[SPEAKER_06]: The downward price pressure has been
extreme and it's a difficult time in the
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Export, which has been discussed on other
panels, is the silver bullet which will
[SPEAKER_06]: cure those woes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we don't deal with that at all on the
hemp side.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hemp is a worldwide market.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, hemp can be, well, individual
jurisdictions are shifting their
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations regarding hemp on a daily
basis, but more or less hemp can be
[SPEAKER_06]: shipped to every state in the United
States and potentially to most countries
[SPEAKER_06]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've got seven billion people who can
benefit from CBD that we produce here in
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon compared to, you know, four million
people plus the tourists who come to
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the cannabis side.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the final benefit that I want
to highlight is all of these combine to
[SPEAKER_06]: create the opportunity to offer cannabis
medicine at a vastly reduced price to the
[SPEAKER_06]: national and worldwide market through CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: In some ways, I think CBD is a gateway
cannabinoid for humans because it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_06]: People aren't afraid of it like they are
THC.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's introducing the entire world to
the incredible benefit of cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine in a safe and affordable way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a great benefit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Cedar.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's exciting to see cannabis medicine,
like you say, having some barriers pulled
[SPEAKER_09]: down and allowing entrepreneurs to start
to tackle these larger markets.
[SPEAKER_09]: But Justin, I know you've experienced some
of the challenges getting into the CBD
[SPEAKER_09]: hemp industry firsthand.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it seems so much easier than
being a recreational cannabis entrepreneur
[SPEAKER_09]: or a medical cannabis entrepreneur,
but it's not without its pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe you could detail just some of the
challenges that you've experienced or that
[SPEAKER_09]: people should be ready for if they plan to
enter this market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have to preface that with this
definitely comes from the perspective that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm approaching it from a participant in
the hemp cultivation side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is also present in other forms of
cannabis, and people are bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains that can be one-to-one
ratios or whatnot inside of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: programs in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm coming from the perspective of,
again, agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're dealing with things at tens
of acres or hundreds of acres or even
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were several thousand acres under
cultivation in Oregon this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost entirely for its high CBD
content, and that is then targeted for
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction into some kind of a concentrate
that's going to be used in products,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you scale up activities like that,
there's all the attendant capital
[SPEAKER_00]: investments you have to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to figure out your logistics,
your costs, how you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are certain parts of an
infrastructure for this to be a real
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, either statewide or nationally,
that are just not there at all yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so choices are being made in a vacuum
of clear guidance about the best way to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop that infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in part due to the fact that
at the federal level, our government is
[SPEAKER_00]: dragging its feet about providing clarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to hold onto this bastion
of this being a controlled substance that
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be really firmly regulated for as
long as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That means if I want to cure my hemp,
right, or any of our farmers who grow
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics want to cure our hemp in order to
then be able to extract it, they can't go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the old tried and true methods that
cannabis growers have been using for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades at this scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't hang 50,000 pounds of dry weight
hemp in a little space and expect that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be able to handle that on
a logistical level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's from the front-side end of
planting, irrigating, cultivating,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the back-side end of harvesting,
whether to do that mechanically and what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of equipment is available out there,
and then how you're going to dry,
[SPEAKER_00]: cure, process, transport, all of that
infrastructure is still really in nascent
[SPEAKER_00]: forms of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people have put hemp in the
ground and then had no clue what to do
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to fall and the rains are
starting to fall and they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how to get their crop off the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does take a lot of forethought and
careful planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that, you know,
we're involved directly, phytonics,
[SPEAKER_00]: with breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in order to meet the federal
regulations and grow something as hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to be qualified with a variety
that is supposed to mature at less than
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.3 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal language is Delta-9 THC,
which makes our job easier because most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC content at harvest is still THCA,
but different, which means that it hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been decarboxylated to become Delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some states, Kentucky,
for example, which is another,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, center of a lot of hemp
cultivation right now, they apply a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversion ratio to your THCA and they
say, you know, 0.877% of that is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be Delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you harvest too late in Kentucky,
your THC levels will be out of compliance
[SPEAKER_00]: and by the law you're supposed to destroy
your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of lack of clarity of state
to state to state about uniform standards
[SPEAKER_00]: can leave folks in Tennessee and Kentucky
and North Carolina where we've been out,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've sold our seeds, we've been
consulting with old tobacco farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, who are trying to make this
transition, can leave them really up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the air and really uncertain as to how to
best proceed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, I would say that getting good
genetics or good seed stock to start with
[SPEAKER_00]: can be really challenging in this current
unregulated kind of wild west state of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know personally, you know, here in
Oregon, in multiple states, folks who on
[SPEAKER_00]: good faith bought seeds that were
represented to them as a feminized hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that would be compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the aspect of having feminized seed is
important to cannabis cultivators all
[SPEAKER_00]: around who don't want to have their fields
pollinated by the hemp field that's two
[SPEAKER_00]: miles down the road that's 40 acres and
just, you know, went seed and threw a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of pollen into the wind and now
everybody else's crop is seeded as a
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact then found out that those
seeds either weren't feminized or weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually compliant hemp or didn't
germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are horror stories upon horror
stories upon horror stories out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So building relationships, doing proper
diligence, don't just rely on the word of
[SPEAKER_00]: a broker just because somebody tells you
something, you know, if you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in this, you're going to have to
dig deeper and you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: take the time to do your diligence and
make sure that your fundamental building
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks that you're working with are good
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you're again going to have a
real hard time come harvest time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Justin.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, in any maturing industry like this,
there's pitfalls left and right.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's snake oil salesmen.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's hucksters.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the due diligence piece that
you pointed out is incredibly important if
[SPEAKER_09]: you're trying to enter the market and
make, you know, business to business
[SPEAKER_09]: partners, buy seeds, all of it is
incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we've given a good little
overview, but we have these experts up
[SPEAKER_09]: here and I'm curious if anybody has any
questions out in the audience.
[SPEAKER_09]: Ingaio, you back there?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I was wondering, I assume that you
guys heard about the DEA rescheduling 0.1%
[SPEAKER_04]: THC CBD products so long as they have FDA
approval.
[SPEAKER_04]: That just took place yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was wondering if you could speak to
what effect that has.
[SPEAKER_04]: How hard is it to get FDA approval?
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do mom and pop growers have a chance at
making that happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a doozy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wants to tackle that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'd only say that, well,
I guess it depends on what kind of mom and
[SPEAKER_03]: pop you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, I have a client that's in
the tobacco industry and one of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: they do is they get cigars through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you want to do a cigar that's
this tall and go through that entire
[SPEAKER_03]: process with the FDA, it's $15,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to do a cigar that's
exactly the same, but it's just slightly
[SPEAKER_03]: shorter, it's still $15,000 and up to
about 45.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just dealing with the FDA itself
and the attorneys that deal with it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can't speak to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like asking your mechanic to take out
your appendix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not the right guy to do it,
but I can't tell you that it's expensive,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's arduous, and it's gonna take a lot of
people out of the market if that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: they have to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strangely, most people don't really care
what the DEA says and that has a lot to do
[SPEAKER_03]: with the Appropriations Act, which has
been kind of mirrors what's been going on
[SPEAKER_03]: with marijuana itself, which is we've got
the Congress, the legislature collectively
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, you can't do anything to any of
these people because we have a hold of
[SPEAKER_03]: your purse strings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so long as these people are compliant
with the Farm Bill Act and the provisions
[SPEAKER_03]: within and their state laws, you can't
touch them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you have that at least for a couple
more days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hang in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you want to add to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just in the sense that this is not
meant to obviously encourage access or
[SPEAKER_00]: make it easier for the mom and pops
operators, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same sense that Aaron was talking
about, consolidation is coming to this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FDA and the DEA are sort of
gatekeepers to try and keep the reins on
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as possible, so this is my
opinion, so that the giants in
[SPEAKER_00]: agribusiness and in big pharma can be
positioned to capitalize when the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory framework allows, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the DEA research licenses are typically
with universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very difficult to get,
so they want you to partner with an
[SPEAKER_00]: existing university.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the IP rights that often that are
part of those deals, the university wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a piece of that, so that's one way
that they sort of keep a clamp on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, yeah, this is a very expensive
processes that typically you have to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: really well-capitalized business to be
able to go through to get these kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: approvals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that on at least an
initial reading of the versions of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm Bill 2018 Farm Act that we see that
there is language that really does provide
[SPEAKER_00]: some clarification in terms of our ability
to access, take things to market,
[SPEAKER_00]: derivatives of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we don't have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that there's a window of
time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few years, whatever that period
of time is, where entrepreneurial start-up
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses have a chance to really make
hay, and I would suggest that if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: in that position, leverage the best you
can during this window of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the current barriers to,
say, a CBD edible being able to sell and
[SPEAKER_05]: transport that over state lines,
also internationally?
[SPEAKER_06]: Export across state lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: Regulations are evolving rapidly,
but currently it's pretty much a green
[SPEAKER_06]: light to export across state lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that depends on the jurisdiction that
you're exporting into.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the hemp has to be certified as
approved by the originating state's hemp
[SPEAKER_06]: program.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because regulations are always
changing, for example, California just
[SPEAKER_06]: banned CBD in food products.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was all of a sudden, it's a
tremendous hit to all those companies who
[SPEAKER_06]: were depending upon that supply chain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So individual jurisdictions are changing
their regulations rapidly.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in general, interstate commerce is
open in the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: For CBD, for high CBD products,
or CBD only products, is that what you're
[SPEAKER_07]: saying?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and just to hop in there,
speaking from an organ entrepreneurial
[SPEAKER_09]: standpoint, you need to have a permit from
the ODA.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're just talking about making that
edible, you'd want your ODA Hemp Handlers
[SPEAKER_09]: permit, and then also you'd want a
commercial kitchen license.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you had those two things, and if your
end product was below .3% THC and tested
[SPEAKER_09]: by a certified organ laboratory,
that would be a legal CBD hemp edible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to add how goofy that is,
in Washington, if you want to put hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: into a product of any type, and you've
grown that hemp in Washington state,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to be licensed in Washington
state.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you brought some CBDs or hemp from
out of the state and put it into a
[SPEAKER_03]: product, there's no restrictions
whatsoever because we removed it from
[SPEAKER_03]: schedule one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So under state law.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's only to illustrate that
legislatures trying to catch up with their
[SPEAKER_03]: own rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's these swinging gates,
like you were talking about with
[SPEAKER_03]: California, where it's like they were
letting everything in, and then there's
[SPEAKER_03]: this knee-jerk reaction of going the other
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have to be a part of that
conversation and kind of good citizens.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in this market, you kind of have
a duty to be down there in Salem and at
[SPEAKER_03]: those meetings and at those discussions
about what's going to happen with these
[SPEAKER_03]: things and be responsible for being a part
of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's things going on with CBD nobody
wants to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you make a concentrate,
what happens with the THC?
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't talk about it because they're
like there's other things going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the truth is that if you sit and
continuously concentrate something,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a concentration of THC as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody's talking about what we're
doing with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we don't want this knee-jerk
reaction because some legislature starts
[SPEAKER_03]: up with what about the children,
then you need to be involved to avoid it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: One more question, I think, and then we're
going to break for lunch.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: My question builds on that a bit further.
[SPEAKER_08]: A bit further, I extract oil now and have
had a lot of market demand from growing
[SPEAKER_08]: sizes, bulk level people, commercial
operations wanting to put it in their
[SPEAKER_08]: microbreweries or what have you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I'm curious how you see,
when they ask me, say if I'm going to Ohio
[SPEAKER_08]: or something like that and they ask me
that question, they're like, okay,
[SPEAKER_08]: so we're going to put this in our product.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the legalities of us putting this
into our product and distributing it
[SPEAKER_08]: locally within our population?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if there's an answer for
that, but I get asked that all the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to take that, Aaron?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would only say it's really up to your
lawyer and their lawyer to figure that
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll write the memo.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll charge you accordingly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's really, and the problem with
it is, as I was saying earlier,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's state to state.
[SPEAKER_03]: It varies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got 38 states that have rules on
this and a bunch of others that don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: As these guys pointed out, it's in every
state no matter where we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are they getting it from?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they doing it?
[SPEAKER_03]: But lawyers write memos, I think,
that kind of give them and their clients
[SPEAKER_03]: the kind of coverage that they need so
that they can move forward and do these
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the joy of being on the tip
of the spear, baby.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Brick and mortar establishments are under
higher risk because of their physical
[SPEAKER_06]: location.
[SPEAKER_06]: Online commerce, check with your lawyer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It appears to be pretty safe, but I think
in Nebraska and North Dakota, if I recall
[SPEAKER_06]: correctly, a couple of small brick and
mortar establishments have been raided for
[SPEAKER_06]: their CBD products.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2003 in the Chong story with the bongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get calls regularly now still where
people are like, can I just sell
[SPEAKER_03]: paraphernalia online?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this whole conference is federally
illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all a big RICO conspiracy to
violate federal law.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a question of where your risk levels
are in doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then like you were saying, it's be the
change you want to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always say only break one law at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, more to the point,
it's like if we're going to do this one
[SPEAKER_03]: thing and this is what we're doing,
then show the world how to do it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the best I can do with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: One last question for real this time
because he was very patient.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to do one more question and
then we're going to break for lunch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've probably met all of you at
some point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Cascade High.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a cannabis company here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're obviously looking at CBD market
expansion nationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two major issues that we've kind of
already segued on, which is are you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly doing CBD isolate distillate to be
able to keep that THC out or are you just
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable when you're doing your
processing in an extra extraction if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're moving full spectrum oil,
I assume it's got THC levels in the 3%
[SPEAKER_01]: area way above the .3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then second question, probably cedar for
you more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you or actually Aaron from Cultiva,
do you advise setting up a secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: company to be moving those CBD products
because of the risk confusion there with
[SPEAKER_01]: the OLCC cannabis business and any
feelings about that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll handle the first question.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second one was a legal question,
so I won't handle it.
[SPEAKER_06]: For extraction, Siski Sungrown,
we base all of our products on ethanol
[SPEAKER_06]: extracted oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're making a crude oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: That crude oil will always be above .3%
THC, so it's not a commercial product for
[SPEAKER_06]: us.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of the many gray areas of the
law is this intermediate step where the
[SPEAKER_06]: concentration occurs and then it's
formulated into another product and
[SPEAKER_06]: diluted below .3.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a gray area, so there's no concrete
answer then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check with your lawyer.
[SPEAKER_06]: The short answer is that our crude oil is
not a commercial product except in the
[SPEAKER_06]: OLCC system.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of our commercial products are
reformulated so that the dilution brings
[SPEAKER_06]: THC below .3.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very, very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it again from the panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
