[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, today we're talking about cannabis
legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis legacy is something which is not
always long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis legacy also has something to do
with the future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please allow me to also give an outlook
on the future of cannabis in that panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not only about the history of
cannabis, but of course I think we start
[SPEAKER_01]: with the history of cannabis because we
have to very experience the players from
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Ben Brokkers from Amsterdam,
from Holland, from Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a founder of Sancy Seeds and please
give a warm welcome again.
[SPEAKER_01]: To my right side, Douglas Jordan is the
founder of CanAx.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Jamaican Cannabis Expo,
which is similar like our congress here,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the ICBC, but a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gordon will tell us about it later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please another warm applause for
Gordon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before we start, I think cannabis
legend Ben Brokkers, because Ben,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel really appreciated, I feel honored
that I can interview you the second time
[SPEAKER_01]: in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for that option.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ben will interview his short history
or his long cannabis history in a short
[SPEAKER_01]: movie and I would say or in a short video
and I would say I give the microphone to
[SPEAKER_01]: Ben and he can explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it also there on the monitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, this is somewhere I started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Naughty and dangerous sometimes,
finding seeds all over the world.
This is with my son, Alan, the guy with
the airplanes.
This is also nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did give some awards and some beautiful
people got them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all in the museum to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry about this video because
somebody just put it together and it's,
that is the Barcelona Museum, something
really I have to go do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a museum in Amsterdam.
Here it comes.
And it's already 30 something years maybe
35 years, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Sensi Seat in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the Sensi Seat in Barcelona
next to the museum.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a flagship show.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another show in Amsterdam,
The Flying Dutchman, where we also sell
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took that brand over from a very close
friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we do with the breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite a big and it's changed a lot
since I was the breeder and my son was the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of change.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to tell you something about it
later on.
Important stuff, very important stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So beautiful stuff for the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the protein and the scent of
the seeds is very much needed in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the museum in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We took nine years to renovation.
It's a modernist building.
It was terrible when we started,
but it became really nice.
You should visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barcelona is a nice place.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's even a beach you can swim naked.
It's a beautiful city.
I love Barcelona.
So to make it a bit long, I'm sorry,
but you have some impression for what we
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small but very, very cozy and nice objects
inside.
I could have around 40 or 45 years,
so I have a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just make the catalog and it's nearly
9,000 pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be an idiot to collect so
much, but it is so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the passion, what is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do some cannabis college.
[SPEAKER_02]: People from all over the world come there
to introduce there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a group of nine people that want
to know all about hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you know about Thailand, what
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: My son, Alan, teach in Thailand on two
universities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Already a couple years, I think three
years, and he got an honorary doctorate in
[SPEAKER_02]: September from the university.
[SPEAKER_02]: He teach campus and he was also on the
barricade to legalize.
Happy what happened in Thailand.
It's amazing.
This is so beautiful.
This is hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did hemp flags, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so sad and it's a little bit on it
because hemp is the future.
No doubt about it.
We have a company in Holland for 27 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 years, we lost that money a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now finally we made some money,
especially with the CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of COVID, all the other things is
going down again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we make the insulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The factory is just two years open,
two and a half.
The insulation is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the glass room, the rock room,
all the pollution.
[SPEAKER_02]: The energy, the taste, the producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we got this hemp wool and this
hemp insulation.
The crazy thing I never knew, we isolate
for cold here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cold, we isolate good and then we're
not cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hemp is not only for the cold,
it protects much, much better than glass
[SPEAKER_02]: wool for heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in our mother's little stand,
you can see how fast it takes out the
[SPEAKER_02]: heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the future for hemp is absolutely
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are quite industrial now, all financed
by ourselves, since you see it mainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need also more investment in that
sense that if we really grow on,
we do 3,000 hectares now that we need to
get investments.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else I want to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I go on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the other thing is there's two
things important.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing is I hear that there's a
sort of meeting now between different
[SPEAKER_02]: countries, Holland, Germany, Portugal and
another few countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to change the cannabis rules
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is bloody important because
cannabis is a social cultural possession.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means cannabis is from everybody,
like a tomato is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that point of view, you have to
see that legalization is very important
[SPEAKER_02]: soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best way to do that is like the
Thai style.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just legalize everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to grow, you grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to sell, you sell.
Whenever you do, you do it.
So that's very important.
We received, it was also a new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was worried about already a long time
that all the CBD, they have to do the
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction, CO2 extraction, full.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have all kinds of different
distractions.
And you've got to isolate.
Well, there is a big research going on at
the moment about the toxicity of CBD in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: The AIA do that, European hemp
organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a study for more than one and a half
million, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first results come out that CBD is
okay for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isolate, not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm scared that isolate will be again
something, but the anti-cannabis people
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna smash us with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was even a new doctor's group now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say cannabis can cause cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's in the newspaper again.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the queues gets it, it's proven.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a funny world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a crazy world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you ask me anything later,
I talk to some stoned also, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me ask you one question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You founded Sensei Seeds, I think,
in 1985.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were the founder of the first medical
cannabis company in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody knows that because you're
not into that company anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're also founded one of the first
hemp fiber companies in the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is Hempflex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you have your CBD line from Sensei
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my question to you is quite simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is more harmful?
[SPEAKER_01]: To run a seed bank in 1985 or to run a CBD
business in 2022?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, the difference is in the
old days, it was all doped heads,
[SPEAKER_02]: most of them only doped heads,
who had the dream like Jack Herrer,
[SPEAKER_02]: who went very good, close friend for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these people that had their ideal,
not only about cannabis as a friend,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also the possibilities of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you see in the museum.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking CBD now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until 1900, 85% of its medicine contained
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got a beautiful collection of old
bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prove it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something for euphoria,
there's something for hysteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: These old kind of cannabis, old bottles,
it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope anybody got some with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see I'm stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in those days, the guys, they were
working with a plant.
Everything was a plant.
You grow it, you smoke it, you sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you make some money here and you
put the money there again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was all about the plant.
And for me, it is still all about the
plant.
And I know you guys, a lot of people here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, we need money.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also, hand plants need money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's short of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody needs money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all business, just a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all business.
But it's now business about making money.
It's not anymore.
And it has to be like that.
I respect it.
You know, I never expected that I'm gonna
be big in hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have three factories.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just was in Norkeling in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: The insulation factory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was running and the insulation came
out and I cried.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't have enough customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all no subsidies and all this
shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is still the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still on barricade.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they come with rules and
regulations, you're fucked over
everywhere.
And it's terrible.
The banks don't accept us.
Even the bank in Holland, ABN Amro,
it's our bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take all the millions we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we can pay your bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot borrow 100 euro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a director, new one.
A special director for sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe you see my book, We Do Wonder.
It's a beautiful book.
So I sent it also to him.
And I sent it to 2,000 people about the
full senate of Holland.
The first and second chamber.
[SPEAKER_02]: The total city council from Amsterdam,
from Rotterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sent it to about 100 journalists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got one reaction from our people,
from the politicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're scared.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still scared of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, you're stoned and
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck off, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask Gordon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have Gordon here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Gordon comes from a country which also
has a very big cannabis legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which has cannabis as a part of its
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different from Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different from Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Jamaica, where Gordon comes from,
cannabis is part of the society.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever since a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Germany, in Europe, that changed the
hippie area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before, cannabis was known,
but was not very widespread.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question to Jordan is, in which way
you founded, you're in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in the cannabis industry now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how did the Jamaican cannabis legacy
influence the development of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry in Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_01]: With the strains, with the growing
techniques in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any influence, or did you just
grow up your own business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think from our perspective,
you know, when I started cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was because I saw a huge reaction in
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was based in fare.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the traditional farmers were
scared that you were going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadians and just people from overseas
come in and take over the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there would be no space for them in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was a very, to me it was
very, very impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't have a, you know,
it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're bringing all the legacy of cannabis
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of a real deep-seated business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the desire to see the Caribbean
thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I saw was on the horizon that we
could get left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica could get left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: All Jamaica represents for this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Culturally, you know, how it's inspired so
many people around the industry to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: embrace cannabis, embrace the way of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the real possibility of being left
behind, being excluded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was something that really didn't
sit very well with me at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my reaction was what could we do to
ensure that did not happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the biggest, the biggest thing
we did that helped in that is we decided
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring to our conference, to host a
conference, first of all, the
[SPEAKER_00]: international community can see was at a
certain standard, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But to then bring growers from legal
markets to come and talk to cultivators in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica, to bring doctors from legal
markets to speak to doctors in Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_00]: and scientists and business people,
regulators, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, everyone's speaking the
same language at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what has been lost over time
is the deep history of Jamaica with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very happy to have seen this
evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're all experts until we know
something that we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until we learn what we don't know,
we all know everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what we have seen is
cultivators, when they've been able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to cultivators from other
communities, other markets, that have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same relationship with the plant,
the same care, the same understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy that it represents,
then it builds trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can let their guard down to say,
well, and we saw the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, cannabis, it was so touching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw, and I saw a guy from Amsterdam
actually, I forget his name, it was
[SPEAKER_00]: Captain Hooter and somebody else,
but they sat with, you know, we let a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the traditional farmers come in without
a charge so they can be part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the first day, they sat and they
were sort of assessing their bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, what are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with my bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing this, and then because
they saw the expertise, the care,
[SPEAKER_00]: the attention, the knowledge, then the
following day, here were these two guys
[SPEAKER_00]: from Amsterdam sort of critiquing some of
it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The following day, there's probably about
15 farmers waiting to talk to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: for them to assess their bud and say,
is mine better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a wonderful thing because when
you break down these walls that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: artificially erected, then you have this
energy that can flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, I hear you know,
obviously your legacy is way beyond mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if there's one point of coming in
clean in the last sort of six,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven, eight years, this industry,
I have seen is that yes, it's a business,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you try to do this business without
the essence and the heart of what this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant represents, and I'm going to use
some of the colorful language you use
[SPEAKER_00]: because I like to, you're going to get
fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the plant knows what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have seen so many people since we
started Canix running to Jamaica and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they promised the sun, the moon,
the stars, and they bamboozled people out
[SPEAKER_00]: of their businesses and what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of those people today are
thriving in Canix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this plant has taken them apart,
spat them out, and now you have to come
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the reality that you can build a
pharma-based business, you can build a
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic business, you can build any
ancillary business that touches this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're doing it without an
appreciation and understanding of how we
[SPEAKER_00]: can help people, how we can serve people,
I don't care how smart we all are,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how well we've been trained,
you're going to get eaten up and spat out
[SPEAKER_00]: as it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the European cannabis
industry, you are part of it for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gordon just mentioned some fears Jamaican
organic farmers or traditional farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about the development of
the cannabis, of the producing cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: market or the cannabis production in
Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the people who should be in
the position to produce cannabis are
[SPEAKER_01]: there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think in general you waste a lot
of knowledge because it cannot be used in
[SPEAKER_01]: public so far?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a question like do you still
grow tobacco in your garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You buy it in the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you grow your own wine in your garden?
You buy it in the shop.
It will be there in the future.
It has to be industrial.
It's like you said, it is for the people.
But also one thing is for sure,
quality conquers all.
And a lot of companies like you mentioned,
they can do any kind of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the biggest are here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know names.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the quality is not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always difficult because I never met
anybody who didn't say my grass is the
[SPEAKER_02]: best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always the best when you grow it your
own.
So grow your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing what I see is that
genetically there's so much hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I met a guy who was quite known in the
field and he said well in America it's 80%
your genes since you see genes in it.
So it spreads out and it's good.
It's okay.
That's the best thing that can happen.
But in the meantime there's a big demand
now, a bigger demand on the regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody wants feminized, everyone
wants these.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the regular seeds also, you know
there's still the beautiful races growing
[SPEAKER_02]: a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about regular races,
when we talk about selection of strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: Gordon, I want to know from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in Jamaica 31 years ago.
And I know there were a lot of collectors
of strains already at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strains were a topic in Jamaica before
they were a topic in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know in Netherlands they were also a
topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there a chance or was there a
chance to bring the Jamaican genetics to
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry or do they still grow
imported genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes two of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what I've seen in Jamaica and what
I hear in Jamaica, and you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: actually is very disturbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember being at a conference in Vegas
and a Canadian grower actually told me
[SPEAKER_00]: that they don't need to grow Jamaican
genetics and bring them out of Jamaica
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to do it in a greenhouse in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put the Jamaican stamp on it and that's
the end of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was that attitude that I just felt
was so, it's just completely out of sync
[SPEAKER_00]: with what this industry represents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of work being
done in terms of IP in Jamaica and how you
[SPEAKER_00]: protect the seeds and genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where that sits today, it's still being
developed and evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think unfortunately for Jamaica we have
not seen yet the kind of progress in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that I would like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the industry is not working as
closely together as it should to affect
[SPEAKER_00]: the positive impacts that it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why I like to go to all these
different international conferences is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a very sharp reminder of the
potential of the Jamaican industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again I go back to sort of the references
and the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about brands all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is a brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Brand is a construct of values that it
represents to a consumer and the Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: brand quote unquote is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have some friends who have been
in this industry as they like to tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were in this industry long before it
was legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're shipped all over the world and
they tell me that they can tell folks how
[SPEAKER_00]: to organize the banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can figure out everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know again we get so complicated
and sophisticated today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what one of my friends said to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, let me tell you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: See all this strange, strange,
strange talk.
Back in the day we used to take all the
Jamaican weed, compress it together,
[SPEAKER_00]: put in a brick, ship it off to New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what the people would say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn this is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a real, in terms of the
consumer, and I saw this when I was first
[SPEAKER_00]: starting this event off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to LA and I told them I was going
to do this event in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know a ganja event in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first person says to me, that's a shit
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to get the good weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I start to get defensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this man had been to Jamaica in the
past three years over a hundred times.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd been to all the different
cultivators, all the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew exactly what he was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later the same day I go to a friend of
mine who's a music producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, I'll tell him the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says that's a brilliant idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the weed in Jamaica is the best in
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm hearing this both sides of the
coin here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says to me they brought the game down
to record music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from his first day he's like forget
the music.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're smoking weed the whole time we're
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why am I making this point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because on the seed side of it,
on the genetic side of it, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: market just like fine wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a connoisseur who knows that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is going to be able to sip that wine
and say this is good and this is not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 95% of the consumer, it's a different
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you land in Havana and someone hands
you a hand-rolled cigar, you're like this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a cigar.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're buying a quality cigar from
your little cigar shop in Idaho,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like yeah, I bought a cigar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to be very aware of what the
whole brand experience is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to move it away from the sort of
historical nature of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the things that I look at
with a pure vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learn a lot from folks who've been in it
for as long as you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's such a deep and rich history that
we must not let go of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in this next iteration,
from my perspective with this industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: is understanding what those things
potentially mean for today's consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was guilty of this in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk a lot about cannabis being a
commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet the interesting thing about
cannabis is cannabis can be commoditized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also a finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raw flour is a finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a consumer for whom that is the
finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we as an industry have to represent
and protect these different ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately, and you get to where
you talked about it's grown in your back
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at what we've seen with alcohol and
beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone from mass production to now a
real value for craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I mean there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you talk about quality different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, I never met anybody who
would grow him on his own.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not with countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Jamaica has bloody good grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sensei seeds have about around 1,000
different varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And about 400 we keep constantly alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we still have the same plants like 35
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is important because it's like wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can drink a glass of bottle of wine.
You say, I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like that.
Like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even with everybody here, we can smoke
different grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody will pick his own.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And medically it's going to be also like
that.
So it's always nice to try different
varieties, I think.
And then you find the one you like the
most.
But it's important still also for the
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consumers to have those choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see now that I hear in America,
you have choices about 100 different
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be difficult to choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the funny thing is today you pick this
and then three months later they have a
[SPEAKER_02]: new name on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like Shakespeare said
already what's in the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And quality is number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have real something that you
can keep constantly the same.
That is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is what the medical marijuana
from Holland, from Jack's Harris strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is super good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm happy for the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They smoke that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course they can go to a coffee shop
and buy something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe they like it more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's everybody different in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you were collecting seeds in the
1980s, I don't remember but I know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you were actually the only person who
brought in indica genetics into Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were only people bringing in haze
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the sacred seed crew, like
shoemakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all bringing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually I don't know if the audience
or even the industry, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry knows two or three strains of
your company are the basis for any hybrid
[SPEAKER_01]: and for any indica cannabis which is now
sold as medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.
Of course it's not us to do that.
But it's true.
Well that is fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were also in Holland the first who did
the cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody here about cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody always with seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was also a new development that
right away we could put a greenhouse full
[SPEAKER_02]: of the same plants like wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before that you have all kind of
different plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also true that of course the new
technology now in the laboratories going
on, they are far.
We are classical breeders.
The old style.
And my son Alan is already a step ahead.
And now my other son Ravi, they're working
already in the lab with all kind of stuff.
So it's going really to scientific matter.
And it has to be industrial.
It has to be business.
It has to be like anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not anymore under the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana should be legal, open for
everybody as a social, cultural
[SPEAKER_02]: possession.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people should make money on it.
In all kind of ways what everybody here
try to do.
And we all try our best.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all what we can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have to do it for the people I
think.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a young guy, when I was 18
years old, I went to my first coffee shops
[SPEAKER_01]: in Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very, very nice experience for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was kind of expecting that
Netherlands is kind of legalized someday.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the whole situation changed in
the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it became clear that the
Netherlands will not legalize very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the first decade of the 2000,
I thought okay, the Netherlands will also
[SPEAKER_01]: not be the first country in the world to
legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there were other players on the
scene which were part of the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you developed your business,
everything in Amsterdam, at the center of
[SPEAKER_01]: the European cannabis culture for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see the future of the Dutch
cannabis culture and industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it like going down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it dying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or can it like come back again?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to, I hope that all the deaths
will be gone on stone like me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the Dutch gonna smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't look in the future in that
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the politicians are totally
spaghetti.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go this way, that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they find always something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it is hard to say that they make an
experiment now that 10 cities gonna have,
[SPEAKER_02]: or something, 10 cities gonna have an
experiment that they don't buy in the back
door, illegal anymore.
But now they're gonna have producers and
they buy it legal.
And then I worry, you know, because I
smoke hash also.
If the coffee shops only can sell
products, I wouldn't like it.
The other thing I would like, I can say,
open the world and we can have the good
hash that I smoked in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my museum, I tell the story that the
farmer in Afghanistan, he got about 200,
[SPEAKER_02]: 300, maybe something like that,
at dollars a kilo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the coffee shop in Amsterdam,
it adds up to the consumer for 16,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: So could we buy good Afghan hash there for
a couple of thousands?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Afghans make schools, farms,
hospitals, and we can smoke good Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wouldn't that be nice?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also did not talk about the
American hash yet, because this is also
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of the market supplying Europe ever
since, which until the early 2000s,
[SPEAKER_01]: it had 90% of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it went down a little bit,
but still it has all, big part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: German cannabis market is covered by
hashish from Morocco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we all know, Morocco is changing
policies right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this would also be a very,
very good chance to bring Morocco into the
[SPEAKER_01]: boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not so many people have to die in
boats, you know, because Morocco's
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is dying and a lot of people are
dying every day trying to enter Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: through Morocco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the work in cannabis industry
in Northern Africa, it's not only about
[SPEAKER_01]: Morocco, the work in cannabis industry in
Northern Africa would be a very good
[SPEAKER_01]: reason not to try to come to Europe,
you know, if we have a world market,
[SPEAKER_01]: and to drown in the Mediterranean Sea.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very sad situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same, they're bombing now Ukraine,
but they're bombing Yemen, they're bombing
Palestine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of Syria is still occupied and
drilling oil.
A lot of people died.
And I would say a long time ago,
and Doug, my friend here, he said,
let's bomb seeds in the world instead of
bombs.
Let's grow marijuana all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take this shit out, all these bad
things that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we stop it?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't, we just can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to do our best to be friendly to
people and that is what they do.
It's politics, you cannot talk about it
anymore.
You're wrong all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't know what they believe
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more and more doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: John, let me ask you, I would say it's not
possible to legalize without politicians
[SPEAKER_01]: and it cannot stay like it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to speak both languages.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know the story in America,
I don't know where exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a senator who always wanted to
have more punishment, more punishment,
and a sheriff who convicted or arrested
thousands of people.
They have a growing license now.
There's two guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens all the time in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to cut you off, we were running out
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clock is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Mika Kadot, Douglas
Gordon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone have any questions for them before
we move on to the next panel?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've learned enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we do love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're ever in Amsterdam or Barcelona,
go to the Cannabis in Hempkin Museum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any closing remarks?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the Barcelona Museum,
please check the windows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody sees the windows and on top
of the museum, the windows are really
[SPEAKER_01]: unique artwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I wanted to add.
Thank you.
Thank you.
