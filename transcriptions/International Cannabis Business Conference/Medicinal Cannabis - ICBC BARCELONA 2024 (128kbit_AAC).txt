[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pleasure to be here one year more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you really enjoy today because
there is great panels and great panelists
[SPEAKER_03]: like the three women are today with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to let them introduce themselves
and after we will start with the
[SPEAKER_03]: conference that I think is going to be
very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Begoña, good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you please introduce yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am coming from the Vecan company,
so now the name we are changing to Evocan,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the market, so doing evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Vecan is a consultancy company
giving the support from the grower to the
[SPEAKER_01]: sales and evaluating all from facility,
quality, security, and at the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: going to the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chloe, please let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Chloe Grossman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the chief of staff for legal at Truly
Cannabis Corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a multi-state operator in the United
States, and I've been in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry for over 10 years in a variety of
positions, so looking forward to sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: with these people and sharing our
different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Chloe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carola, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Carola Perez.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here because I'm a cannabis patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I founded the first patient association
called Dos Emociones 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: the first in Spain, and then we founded
the Spanish Observatory for Medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis to get the law in Spain,
and the last project we created is the
[SPEAKER_02]: IECM Patient Council, where 22
associations, patients associations from
[SPEAKER_02]: all over the world work together in order
to make things better and improve
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves in education, training,
and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Carola.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can start from you,
because if there is someone who knows
[SPEAKER_03]: everything, how is the situation about
medical cannabis in Spain, it's you,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I don't know if it would be a good
question to start talking about what's
[SPEAKER_03]: going on with the European catalog
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let us know what happened with the
harmonization, what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing that's going on in Spain
is that we are going through the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation process right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a new minister of health called
Monica Garcia.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a meeting with the minister two
weeks, three weeks ago with him,
[SPEAKER_02]: and now they're creating the program in
Spain that is going to be available for
[SPEAKER_02]: patients, so these few months that is
going to come are really important for us,
[SPEAKER_02]: because what is going to be decided is
going to be what the patients will receive
[SPEAKER_02]: in Spain, so it's a huge, huge burden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge responsibility, and also we
are fighting against powers that are
[SPEAKER_02]: really big as the physicians, they don't
agree with prescribing medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't have much support from them,
like the government, they don't want to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it, so we are trying to push and push and
push and push, and now they give us
[SPEAKER_02]: something, they give us some proposals,
but now we want to improve them,
[SPEAKER_02]: like for example, the use of the flower
vaporizing for patients is a need,
[SPEAKER_02]: they say it's not, so we are trying to
change this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this hard work to do in the past,
in the next few months, it's too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I hope something changes soon
because it doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chloe, by comparison, can you please tell
us how is the medical cannabis market in
[SPEAKER_03]: the USA?
[SPEAKER_03]: Overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure, so there's a lot going on in
the US, and kind of like in Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: like each country is different in terms of
their cannabis policy, each state is
[SPEAKER_00]: different in terms of its cannabis policy
in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just at a high level you can think
of three different big categories of
[SPEAKER_00]: different medical markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the low THC medical market,
so a few examples would be Texas,
[SPEAKER_00]: Georgia, they tend to be more conservative
states, and in these markets, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: typically a limit on THC, anywhere from
.3% THC to 5% THC, there's really a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction on different product forms,
usually no smoking or vaping, like Carola
[SPEAKER_00]: was saying, and in these markets,
there's often a lot of competition from
[SPEAKER_00]: Pimp products, so there's a lot needed in
terms of patient education, in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the safety profiles of regulated versus
semi-regulated products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's an interesting place to be,
but I think a lot of companies see it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of as a long-term investment play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a second category would be
medical markets, and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sub-categories within medical markets,
they differ immensely in terms of patient
[SPEAKER_00]: qualifying conditions, what product forms
are allowed, some require pharmacists'
[SPEAKER_00]: involvement at the point of dispensation,
the licensing structure differs a lot from
[SPEAKER_00]: state to state depending on which kind of
medical market it is, so there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: variance within that group, and then
finally, the last kind of medical market
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a hybrid market, so that's where
there is both medical and adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis allowed, and in those markets,
I think from a patient's perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things I find interesting is
that some states put restrictions in place
[SPEAKER_00]: or requirements in place to ensure that
businesses continue to really give a good
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of service to patients,
so there can be inventory set-asides for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, as well as expediting patient
access at the point of dispensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, those are just a few of the
differences, lots to unpack within the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Chloe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will talk after, what do you think is
gonna be the future, but let's start with
[SPEAKER_03]: Begoña.
[SPEAKER_03]: And talking about Spain, Begoña,
because that's your expectation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what you do, that's what you
do, that's what you wanna do, that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: you do every single day, and you're
amazing in your work too, so please let us
[SPEAKER_03]: know which kind of requirements would we
need to get a medical cannabis license for
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, the most critical nowadays is the
requirements about the facility and how to
[SPEAKER_01]: be sure that we are fulfilling all the
requirements like narcotics for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Spanish health authorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here, we have to think about the design
of the infrastructure and how the
[SPEAKER_01]: technician that we need considering that
it is a plant, and this is not robust like
[SPEAKER_01]: a pharma product, but we have to ensure at
the end that it is a pharma product,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's not easy to manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: A part of the technician of the facility,
the security measures, and at the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to develop the quality system showing
the disability to the Spanish authorities
[SPEAKER_01]: that is requesting like a narcotic
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, this is the most critical
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes time, so we are speaking about
the priority that it will be more than two
[SPEAKER_01]: years, and Spanish authorities is changing
the idea, so the requirements nowadays is
[SPEAKER_01]: not the same like six months ago,
so I think that they are learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, this is the most, most critical
point now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I would like to know, what is the
biggest handicap we can find if we decide
[SPEAKER_03]: to start the process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the handicap, I think that is two
points.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the big investment, so you have to
consider that it is, we will be speaking
[SPEAKER_01]: about minimum six or eight to 10 million
euro, and the time, so versus time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to, when you decide to go on,
at least you will be more than two years
[SPEAKER_01]: or two years and a half only doing
investment, so without the vision of the
[SPEAKER_01]: market or the sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is the big critical point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we know it's tough, it's tough to
get allies in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to say, Ville, if you allow
me, that listening to Egonia, and they are
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the best companies that can help
you how to invest your money in Spain if
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to go to GMP EU products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm here today because the black
market exists and the industry exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as in Europe and in Spain,
things are really, really slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thank and appreciate the work that
other companies, and some people can go to
[SPEAKER_02]: prison any moment in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are fighting a lot to get approval
from the agency, and on the other side,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is a lot of cannabis in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are having this strange situation,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end, the patients will stay,
go to cannabis social clubs, to the
[SPEAKER_02]: streets, or grow at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not that easy to move on the
pharmaceutical grades, so it's a huge deal
[SPEAKER_02]: in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Carola.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can keep talking about the patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to know, what is the European
Union doing for patients?
[SPEAKER_02]: About patients?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the most important things
about patients is that we are not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be shut up anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some companies and some people used us as
puppets to get medicinal, to get cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are starting to see in the industry
some bad practices in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not going to shut up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to start some webinars in
April called We the Patients by Fundación
[SPEAKER_02]: Cana.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to analyze what we are
receiving from the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, everyone has to be regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who regulates, the people who is
regulated, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to trust them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are seeing things in Europe that we
don't like at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why the IACM patient is so
important right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we want to fight in Europe,
in Brussels, to harmonize our treatments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why a patient in Germany cannot have the
same as a person in Greece?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why all the patients,
the Europeans, went all together to fight
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have the fight in our
countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in Greece, in Portugal, in Italy,
maybe the industry is happy because they
[SPEAKER_02]: have so many licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end, the patients are alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are working on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's really important,
this next step, for not happening the same
[SPEAKER_02]: way in the US, that each region has one
kind of regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the patients are not harmonized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't want to repeat the same
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of work to do still.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about EMA?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they do?
Explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, International Association for
Cannabinoid Medicines was created 25 years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago by Rafal Mishulam, Manuel Guzman,
Frank Jokoson-Hermann, Donald Abrams,
[SPEAKER_02]: the right scientific of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: They created this first society of
cannabis as medicine 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not an easy thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They created in a house, a Franjo house in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they become one of the most important
societies for cannabis as medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fight in the European government.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fight in Brussels.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fight in Germany because it's where
Franjo is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some years ago, he asked me,
Karola, we have to fight for the patients
[SPEAKER_02]: because nothing is working.
[SPEAKER_02]: The industry is failing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are struggling a lot in your
association, in your countries,
[SPEAKER_02]: not to go to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are helping people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are not bad people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are doing what you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are patients too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we decided to work together and we are
in this path right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tough to get any single step,
but you have to keep pushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to keep pushing, but also we need
support.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also we need money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also we need resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if fighting in Spain is too much,
imagine fighting in the European Union
[SPEAKER_02]: when you have these countries like Germany
with the regulations and the programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care about Spain, Greece,
Italy, Portugal, but we care because we
[SPEAKER_02]: are all Europe and we deserve the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see what happened in France two
days ago with the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are not looking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to work together to make things
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially the situation in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to be consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to do everything that is
necessary to make the work possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And getting more people to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to get the work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to get the work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: that is coming up in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not a sure deal but our Health
and Human Services federal agency has
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended to the Drug Enforcement Agency
that they reschedule cannabis from
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule one in the Controlled Substances
Act to schedule three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be the most important thing
that's happened in cannabis regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: history in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: in I don't know 80 years maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that would look like if the Drug
Enforcement Agency decides to accept and
[SPEAKER_00]: implement that recommendation is that
cannabis operators would no longer be
[SPEAKER_00]: treated like drug dealers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some taxation components to
that but I think one of the really big
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts from a patient standpoint is that
it would really open up the ability to do
[SPEAKER_00]: research which is much needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely difficult to be able to do
research on cannabis in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: as a schedule one substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is only a few different places that
researchers can get cannabis for research
[SPEAKER_00]: and the quality is very very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really even very useful in
terms of looking at what real cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products look like and what their impacts
can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think research is one of the big
areas that's going to be impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that just in terms of the
stigma around cannabis I think it would
[SPEAKER_00]: really help shift the narrative and help
the society understand that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: not dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that has a lot of medicinal
benefit and this was just the first step
[SPEAKER_00]: towards I think widespread acknowledgement
of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there is a lot of people
waiting for the federal regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that after the elections this
November something can change or.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man you could look on Twitter and see
any number of people who claim to know
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the situation is we don't really
know when the change is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something should be coming but anyone who
says that they know is probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: telling the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will pay attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Carola just another trend talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: How is the situation in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened to you about the medical
regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a trend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone is talking about the future
Spanish medical regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let us know how the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: No it's going to be solved in a few
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I hope that when we finish 2024 the
second part of the discrete negotiations
[SPEAKER_02]: with the government will finish and then
they have to this because in the Spanish
[SPEAKER_02]: system the NHS is the public system is
going to pay for our medicines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they also have to discuss about funding
who is going to provide who to the
[SPEAKER_02]: hospitals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be a lot of things to
discuss too.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we we are complaining about what the
government offered to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we get an agreement if we can if
we have some power let's go to the press.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go PR campaigns.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few months to to try to make
things better in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we don't do now then it's going to be
too late and too much work to change
[SPEAKER_02]: anything from this law from this decree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah I think I'm really optimistic a
little bit tired too because it's too much
[SPEAKER_02]: to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many people waiting for relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many people wanted for safe medicine
safe access education training feeling
[SPEAKER_02]: safe not feeling like a criminal in their
houses for growing at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to grow at home but we know
that at first we need to pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: for my mother for my grandmother for the
people that maybe cannot grow at home make
[SPEAKER_02]: their own extracts go to Fundación Canon
analysis come back dilute make your
[SPEAKER_02]: topicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too much for a patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need places to be maybe call and
receive our medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's too much to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking care of the plants and making
all the process in my case I'm my
[SPEAKER_02]: decreasing communication is not plants
agriculture or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's new to me and I have to learn because
it's a question of survival and the black
[SPEAKER_02]: market is sometimes too black in Madrid
and we have seen with analysis that is
[SPEAKER_02]: full of a colleague.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis social clubs are better but
they are too expensive and they only exist
[SPEAKER_02]: in Barcelona Mallorca Ibiza the Canary
Islands but the rest of Spain doesn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis social clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are not too many so cannabis social
clubs there are people making good work
[SPEAKER_02]: but still the patients need to feel safe
and we are not feeling safe right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are trying to change this and we are
trying to make the lowest we are the last
[SPEAKER_02]: ones in Europe with Belgium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try to learn from the mistake of all
the countries have made in Europe to make
[SPEAKER_02]: that the best program possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: No the mistakes the things they do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what you have to do in this index
next month and this will mark the way of
[SPEAKER_02]: Spain is going to provide us the medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah it's a passionate moment for us
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that they are going to start with
a very closed and protect scenario in the
[SPEAKER_02]: hospitals with only public hospitals.
[SPEAKER_02]: No private practices no green cards for
100 euros.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't do what they don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also if they are going to pay for the
product they are treating us as criminals
[SPEAKER_02]: before making the program already because
they think we are going to sell the oil
[SPEAKER_02]: and no I need it to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like the Spanish government is so
aware of the we now have a spanner bees we
[SPEAKER_02]: have five million users cannabis in Spain
100 cannabis social clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are so frightened of each move can do
to the other industry and so many people
[SPEAKER_02]: is making a lot of money from the black
market in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is that is we can do a Netflix show
with the Spanish situation is crazy as
[SPEAKER_03]: hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know already how it's going to be
the access for the patients the access to
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis is going to be from
pharmacies going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: No no it's going to be the hospitals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean you have to go to the from the
moment you have to go to the I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a disease and but your primary
care doctor cannot prescribe you cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and they gave me methadone the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they cannot prescribe cannabis because
it has to be done for a specialist in the
[SPEAKER_02]: unity of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the unity of pain for me having
ketamine IV treatment have to wait one
[SPEAKER_02]: year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay one hundred six hundred euros per
three year per three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is how the public system is
working.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you only give us the public system
is not going to work because we are too
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people the pharmacies in the
hospitals are overloaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already know they have to learn how to
use cannabis because it's not easy for
[SPEAKER_02]: them to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know anything about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other day in the meeting in the
minister of health with the doctors they
[SPEAKER_02]: confused CBD with dronabinol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the point the Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone is saying like push carola
push carola and it's like well the
[SPEAKER_02]: observatory can do what we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are fighting ignorant people who is
paid by the pharmacy companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big pharma not the pharma from the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big big pharma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Spain is one of the best place for
lobbies to do whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that with the sun with the
cannabis is this pain is this pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they don't they don't realize they
don't realize yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's cross our fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know which kind of products would be
in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's going to be flowers
dinters traction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's soon to say but I think the formulas
magistrales at the end is going to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are fighting so hard to have
flowers with us because we need they
[SPEAKER_02]: remove the fentanyl for chronic pain
patients because of the overdoses we were
[SPEAKER_02]: having.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need some rescues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we said to the government in the other
day in the meeting we need flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a rescue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine that I'm diabetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you not give me insulin if I'm having
insulin crisis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say why don't you give a rescue to a
pain patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can fell down any minute and lose
consciousness.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know what to say to you because
it's as long as the company sell the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in other countries they are not
going to help us either because they have
[SPEAKER_02]: their business running.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is no way for patients to grow
any plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Spain you can grow at home but you can
go to jail because if a neighbor complains
[SPEAKER_02]: you can the police come to your house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you can go to jail for 48 hours and
then go to a judge and then the judge will
[SPEAKER_02]: decide if you are a drug dealer or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm I'm too old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm too.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pain is too high to deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just I'm just making my medicine
because you don't provide me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to take me to jail do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not going to stop taking care of
myself because you don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to hide if we don't fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No I I understand you're so tired because
it's been a really long and tough and
[SPEAKER_03]: tough way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really know Carola.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for your work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know or could you tell us how is
the way your requirements to become a
[SPEAKER_03]: patient in U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: or for example in Florida in the state do
you work requirements to become a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like many other things in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry it differs immensely
from state to state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally you have to have a
recommendation not a prescription from a
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually the recommendation rather than
prescription is one of the ways that the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis system works outside of the
federal regulatory landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know because federal law doesn't allow
cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drugs are federally regulated and
prescribed based on federal regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recommendation rather than prescription
from a doctor for a qualifying condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be a resident of the state and
usually there is not too much more to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is usually a fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in some states that are pretty anti
cannabis anti patient they put a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks into place to try to make it as
difficult as possible for patients to get
[SPEAKER_00]: certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can mean having to have a
recommendation from two separate
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians having to have a recommendation
from two separate physicians and two
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it very difficult especially
when you're in the early phases of a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical program where there is a lot of
stigma there is a lot of fear from
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily those those types of policies
tend to open up over time as people see
[SPEAKER_00]: that the sky is not going to fall that
people actually have a legitimate medical
[SPEAKER_00]: use for cannabis and that it's not just
just an excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know so I think we see a lot of
progress over time as I hope Spain will as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when the doctor prescribes you some
cannabis it's like you have like a total
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of grains per month or I don't know
any milliliters of any tincture or oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It differs from state to state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just use Florida's an example in
Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor can recommend certain product
forms for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flour for example is recommended for
some patients and not others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles some patients not others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get a total allotment of
milligrams of cannabis that you can get or
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams of THC and CBD that you can
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go make purchases there is a
state system that tracks all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: purchases and draws down on a monthly
basis against your total allotment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in other markets there usually isn't
any specificity from the doctor in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of what forms you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the education about product
types and what product types are good for
[SPEAKER_00]: different conditions happens at the point
of sale which is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of doctors are pretty reluctant to
tell patients this product type or this
[SPEAKER_00]: product form would be good for your
condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think more of that is needed and
hopefully as research opens up we'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: more medical guidelines in terms of how
cannabis is recommended.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have to renew your prescription
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually it's an annual renewal which
requires another trip to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that adds some expense of course and
also you know makes it a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some states allow tele tele doc so a video
call with your doctor but a lot require
[SPEAKER_00]: you to go into your doctor every six
months every year to ensure that you still
[SPEAKER_00]: have your qualifying condition and then
your paperwork is processed with the state
[SPEAKER_00]: and your card or registration is renewed
or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Chloe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know Carola.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about a German rapper
German rapper about an advertisement.
[SPEAKER_03]: You remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about them because the
German legalization the way they were
[SPEAKER_03]: using patients and you told me something
about a singer and a German singer and
[SPEAKER_03]: there was an adverse time and was not very
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when do you think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go back to the regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said that is going to be like in two
months six months is going to be like the
[SPEAKER_03]: last step.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if in six months we don't have finally
the regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the last chance because we've
been waiting for two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well the issue is that also we have the
news from yesterday in Catalonia that they
[SPEAKER_02]: have elections in two months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the situation in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what happens with the government
because if the government falls again I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry but we are not going to make another
four years in the Congress.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been through too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have mistreated us too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are like already prepared for
something to happen when we want to touch
[SPEAKER_02]: the finals get the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then suddenly a pandemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then suddenly new elections and suddenly
one fifty five in Catalonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some is really hard happens in our our
country when we were about to touch the
[SPEAKER_02]: glory and we lost and we lost and we lost
and we lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought it we lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought it we lost it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I'm just trying to be neutral
because it hurts me like a patient in my
[SPEAKER_02]: pain and in my health mental health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we think that now is the moment that
now we we need a lot of support in Spain
[SPEAKER_02]: to say to the minister of health we win
flowers with one private private
[SPEAKER_02]: practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want primary doctors to prescribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want also need a program that takes
care of the quality of life more than the
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are talking about a lot of
clinical trials and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the patients we are not going to wait
and we are going to be medicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes or yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the agency is taking too much long to
make some decisions because that we said
[SPEAKER_02]: before but they have to finish any minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think by December we will have the
final project and the final agreements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know when the first patient is
going to receive the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a question you ask me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because we have a lot of work to do
and they don't provide us any calendar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know everything is a mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are ready for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can call you come tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they can call you not to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they can call you we need this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any chance to change Pepe or Vox
minds you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this happens we are dead because the
Pepe just the Partido Popular just present
[SPEAKER_02]: a pineal proposition for non-law in Spain
saying the government not to regulate
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis as medicine when it was approved.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine a government with them and Vox
that they insult me in the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we don't do now it's not going to
happen at least in five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the when the government crashes I mean
elections and then the Pepe comes to is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to come to win and then four years
of silence and try not to go to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I don't I don't really believe they're
going to change their minds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's finished.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
