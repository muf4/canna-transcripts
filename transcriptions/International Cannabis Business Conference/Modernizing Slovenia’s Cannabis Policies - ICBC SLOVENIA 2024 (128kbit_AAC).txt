[SPEAKER_04]: Here to discuss modernizing Slovenia's new
cannabis policies, the chief compliance
[SPEAKER_04]: officer of the Talman Group and one of my
favorite people in this country,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's hear it for Gaspar Friskovic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought we start with a beautiful
picture of our Lake Bled, because today
[SPEAKER_03]: you're sadly robbed of this beautiful view
because of the weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would invite everybody to come back
once.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice and you'll be able to
enjoy it like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the issue of cannabis has long been
debated in our country, but now finally
[SPEAKER_03]: with new legislation on the horizon,
we're finally taking concrete steps to
[SPEAKER_03]: make medical cannabis more accessible,
safer and regulated for those who need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we heard this morning from our
Secretary of State, we stand at a pivotal
[SPEAKER_03]: moment in our history.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main objectives for our new
legislations are clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to make access for patients,
to protect the youth and to regulate for
[SPEAKER_03]: those in need.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at present, recreational cannabis in
Slovenia is illegal and that also goes for
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that a lot of people
don't know, but if you don't have a
[SPEAKER_03]: license from our Ministry of Agriculture,
growing hemp is illegal and is a criminal
[SPEAKER_03]: offense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So regardless of the level of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: With medical cannabis, the situation is a
bit different because medical cannabis is,
[SPEAKER_03]: although it's legal by law, it doesn't
really work in practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patients cannot access it and basically
due to restrictions in practice that stem
[SPEAKER_03]: down to the position of our agency for
medicinal products and their
[SPEAKER_03]: interpretation of the decree on illicit
drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their position is, as we heard today,
that cannabis can only be prescribed
[SPEAKER_03]: according to guidelines.
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue we have in Slovenia is that we
don't have those guidelines except for
[SPEAKER_03]: terminally ill patients and I know that
Professor Neubauer and his colleagues are
[SPEAKER_03]: now preparing guidelines for pediatric
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the problem or this is the
barrier why doctors cannot prescribe
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis for other medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, in other countries,
like UK, Switzerland, Canada, and so on,
[SPEAKER_03]: they have specific guidelines for a wide,
for a big variety of conditions as
[SPEAKER_03]: Nervette syndrome, fibromyalgia,
insomnia, and so on and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Germany, which we heard is the
biggest medical market in the EU,
[SPEAKER_03]: things are even more pragmatic.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have specific guidelines at
all, but their Ministry of Health just
[SPEAKER_03]: posted a link to the Canadian guidelines
for the website and placing the trust in
[SPEAKER_03]: their medical community that they can take
the right decision based on the knowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: that they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is something that we
could also follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this brings us to the historic moment
that we already heard something about
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Slovenia, on the 9th of June,
2024, we held two referendums on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can see, more than 700,000
participants went to this vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: This might not seem a lot to some of you,
but you have to consider that we have two
[SPEAKER_03]: million inhabitants in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a huge number, and I would
like to show you the results of those
[SPEAKER_03]: votes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you can see, 51.57% of everyone who
voted was for recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the map, you can see the voting
districts that were for and against.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dark blues are the ones that were
against, and the light blues are where the
[SPEAKER_03]: majority was for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I would like to show you the more
interesting one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the map for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you can see, every voting district
in Slovenia was in favor.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, more than 60% in every voting
district.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that is
unprecedented in Slovenia, or let me say
[SPEAKER_03]: it's unprecedented since the vote in 1990
when we voted on our independence.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have never been so united on a
question, and I'm really glad about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that with this mandate,
Slovenia should change its legislation,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think we should follow the German
model.
[SPEAKER_03]: What this means is first taking cannabis
off the narcotics list.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is important because it's gonna ease
the burden on our judicial system.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not gonna be any more criminal
procedures for small possession,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's gonna make prescribing cannabis
much easier, medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: because the doctors will no longer be
prescribing the narcotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not gonna be any prescriptions in
two forms and so on, and it's gonna make
[SPEAKER_03]: it easier for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we should also empower our doctors by
allowing them to apply their expertise and
[SPEAKER_03]: to provide patients with the care they
need.
[SPEAKER_03]: We shouldn't bother them with guidelines,
but rather relate on their knowledge that
[SPEAKER_03]: they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, we should remain a
strong commitment to protecting our youth
[SPEAKER_03]: and dismantling the black market that
sadly still exists in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that this new chapter in
Slovenia's cannabis policy is not or
[SPEAKER_03]: should not just be about legislation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about modernizing our approach to
medicine, patient care, and public health.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about placing trust in our medical
community and ensuring that those who need
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis can actually get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should also be about taking control of
a industry or a sector that sadly,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the absence of good regulation,
threatens the well-being of our youth and
[SPEAKER_03]: of our public health.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really hope that as we move forward
now, I hope we can embrace this change as
[SPEAKER_03]: a nation united, just as we did in 1990
when we were voting on our independence.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am sure that we can create a future
where cannabis policies serve the people,
[SPEAKER_03]: where patients receive the care they need,
and where our laws reflect both the modern
[SPEAKER_03]: medical science and the will of the
Slovenian people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because outside, I was asking Mr. Niemann
if he thinks the German model is the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's stuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I asked him, OK, what's next?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to make it better.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gaboril also.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked him before, what is the best
model?
[SPEAKER_06]: He thinks because he has a lot of
experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: He says it's the Canadian model.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm asking you, is this choosing of
this German model just the final,
[SPEAKER_06]: or it's just a question, thinking about
this?
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll choose the best model.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe how this decision will be taken.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: My timing is perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we should follow the German
model, not copy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So take the things that are good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, as we heard today, and a lot of
other occasions, not take the things that
[SPEAKER_03]: are not so good or try to make them
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the Canadian model would be one
possibility to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have to realize that Canada is not
an EU country.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not bound by the EU regulation,
which is stricter to the conventions of
[SPEAKER_03]: the United Nations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So following the Canadian model for
Slovenia would be quite problematic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we're trying to follow the
German model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, to be honest, it's a pragmatic
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Slovenia, as you heard,
we have 2 million inhabitants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are a small country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think we should be the one
poking the EU Commission with something
[SPEAKER_03]: more than Germany did, from a strictly
political point of view.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as you probably know, Germany was
thinking about getting this selling of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis in these specialized stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they got a more or less clear answer,
don't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they changed their draft for
the new legislation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the EU Commission said no to
Germany, I'm pretty sure they're not going
[SPEAKER_03]: to say yes to Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I think we should follow the
German model, but as I said, not copy it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can
[SPEAKER_06]: you hear me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's the European Union deciding what's
the best model, or are we deciding?
[SPEAKER_06]: Will we decide what's the best model for
us?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you ask, let's say Hungary,
they will say, fuck the European Union.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will decide for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: So asking what we will do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as I said, it's a nice idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think because of the current
position of many, like the United Nations
[SPEAKER_03]: and everything, as I said, I think we
shouldn't poke too much right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially as a smaller country.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be chance later on to amend the
legislation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can always do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think from a political perspective,
it's wise to follow or do what Germany did
[SPEAKER_03]: and not go further.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just my position.
We have a question over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hiya.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we can all agree that all of the
national policies sort of come to a stop
[SPEAKER_02]: when you hit the European policies,
how plausible do you think it would be to
[SPEAKER_02]: get 1 million signatures together?
[SPEAKER_02]: To get an all-European referendum on the
subject?
[SPEAKER_03]: You think to make an EU-wide referendum on
this question, or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much would it cost?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it would probably need to be
proposed by the EU Commission to do
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never heard of EU-wide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some questions over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You ask good questions, but you ask a lot
of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, it would be a nice idea
to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be interesting to see what's the
position of every country.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Varya Hulets.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm attorney at law.
[SPEAKER_08]: I spent the last 20 years of my life
dealing with problems about cannabis in
[SPEAKER_08]: practice.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have a small comment and a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to comment that the
recreational usage is not illegal in
[SPEAKER_08]: Slovenia, but possession is.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the effect is the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I would like to emphasize that
cultivation is legal if you do it just for
[SPEAKER_08]: yourself or, let's say, for a friend who
is sick or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have cases of a Supreme Court that
support this statement.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Germany, before this, was it enabling
enjoyment?
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe prohibited, maybe as misdemeanor,
or maybe as a criminal act, if you have
[SPEAKER_08]: any information.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you repeat the second part of the
question, but just for the group?
[SPEAKER_08]: Enabling of enjoyment is a criminal act in
Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I pass joint to this gentleman,
I'm committing a criminal act.
[SPEAKER_08]: My question is, was it like this in
Germany before?
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it misdemeanor or a criminal act,
if you have any ideas?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody should just roll their own
joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my position is that growing cannabis
for your own is not legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have decisions from the Supreme Court
saying it's OK in this case.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was growing so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by law, it's illegal to grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have the license from the
Ministry of Agriculture, it's not legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The law doesn't say you can grow it for
your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Supreme Court allows it in some cases,
but it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other part of the question,
if I understood correctly, if it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: misdemeanor or a criminal offense to pass
somebody a joint, I don't know what it was
[SPEAKER_03]: like in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's maybe a question for the next
colleague who's coming up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: but is it a misdemeanor or a criminal
offense?
[SPEAKER_03]: A misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an observation first, because we
travel international with this whole
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis issue and CBD issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the overall thing is that,
first, it's wonderful that we're having
[SPEAKER_05]: this conversation because of how it's been
over the last 20, 30, 40 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: But these conversations that you bring
forward, which is actually useful to this,
[SPEAKER_05]: is that these policies that we're doing,
they're still repressive, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my overall question to you is that,
given that you're the second nation in the
[SPEAKER_05]: EU and you're following Germany,
maybe this is a way of taking a stand to
[SPEAKER_05]: say, look, let's have less repressive and
less repressive issues in the EU as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is a dynamic question for all
of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a nice idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I said, my concerns are,
or my fear is, that if we would take a
[SPEAKER_03]: stance, we would take a bidding from EU
Commission or from anybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the fact is, we're a small
country, and it's always easier to say no
[SPEAKER_03]: to a smaller member of your community than
to the big fellow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we heard, Germany got a no,
more or less, on their idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think, my position is,
if Germany would have changed it the way
[SPEAKER_03]: they fought first and just presented the
bill to the European Commission and said,
[SPEAKER_03]: listen, we're doing this, it would
probably go through.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that they asked for permission and
they got a no, we're sure not going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: a yes from Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the thing about, at least in my
experience with governments in general,
[SPEAKER_04]: is they move very, very slowly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it always takes longer than you think
it should take.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have to be patient, yet
relentless.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always pushing forward, fighting for every
inch, every meter, every centimeter,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every 2.5 centimeters would be an inch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just be relentless and just keep
pushing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we will eventually win.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of us will probably be old by then.
[SPEAKER_04]: But our children will be able to smoke
weed in the streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's always a chance to change it
later.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, step by step.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for the clarification
here in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is more an observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: 35 years ago, I lived in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And consequently, as a result of the last
20 years, I've been involved with a
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible use towards cannabis or any
other drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as part of the agencies and private
sector that deal with treatment for
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction and misuse of any drug,
including alcohol, in Holland,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a very responsible approach to
legalizing and also trying to produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: best treatment centers in the world to
help where there was a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were very innovative there,
not just in terms of cognitive science or
[SPEAKER_00]: the spirituality of what they were using
or inviting other tried and tested
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence-based methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they seemed to have a legalized policy
35 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really, and through ignorance,
understand why there's not some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: reflection on what has happened in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about the German model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's the situation there in the
Netherlands at the moment?
[SPEAKER_03]: So from my information, cannabis was
always illegal in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_03]: They used something that is called in law
the opportunity principle, which means you
[SPEAKER_03]: cannot the state can decide not to
prosecute something.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the bill 10, 15 years ago,
cannabis was illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though they had coffee shops and
everything, but cannabis was illegal,
[SPEAKER_03]: they just didn't prosecute it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if I'm not mistaken, they're starting
these pilot projects now, which is funny
[SPEAKER_03]: in a way to try to figure out how it would
affect the people if you would allow them
[SPEAKER_03]: to buy cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, but it was never legal in the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they didn't legalize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just decided as a state or as a
nation not to prosecute it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a big difference in law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for clarifying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just lastly, on the other point,
what is your policy towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible legalization of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean my personal or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both personal or governmental?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not a member of the government.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I cannot speak on behalf of the
government.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that it's clear that the
current model is not working.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just not just talking about
Slovenia, but globally, prohibition is
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously not working.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had experience with the prohibition
of alcohol in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw how that went.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first organized crime presented with
the prohibition of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have organized crime before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously, prohibition is not working.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had worldwide prohibition for what is
it 60 years almost or even more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's obviously not working.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every survey shows that cannabis is the
most used illicit drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously, it's not working.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to try something new.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that the road that Germany
took, of course, with some improvements,
[SPEAKER_03]: is a nice first step.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have to know that cannabis is
still very stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is still a lot of position against
legalizing cannabis or making it more
[SPEAKER_03]: approachable, both on the medical and the
recreational sector.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think taking it step by step while
taking into account that there are a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of positions against it, that's probably
the right approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the current model is obviously not
working.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just allow me to comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a very relevant question
about analyzing the Dutch experiment,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, because we have decades of
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prohibition came to realization because of
the public health risks and public health
[SPEAKER_01]: cares, let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said we have to prohibit certain
substances because of the risks in public
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's irrelevant, in my view,
from the public health point of view,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether something was legal or illegal,
even though I understand this is a common
[SPEAKER_01]: argument about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have decades of data like nowhere
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important to look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have a very positive outcome of
this model, even though it was not legally
[SPEAKER_01]: based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So legislation is only another human
institution.
[SPEAKER_07]: A short question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you happen to check the legislation in
France?
[SPEAKER_07]: As another big European country?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have not, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I'm not mistaken, it's illegal in
France.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't checked it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There might be powerful in changing
legislation in Europe, like Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably you are aware that there were
several attempts of changing the
[SPEAKER_09]: regulation in Slovenia with regards
medical cannabis also before our
[SPEAKER_09]: referendum.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how do you comment them?
[SPEAKER_09]: And would you take something from them to
combine it with the German model?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or did you find them completely useless?
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, as I said, I think that the regulation
of medical cannabis right now in Slovenia
[SPEAKER_03]: is actually not bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is mainly the position of our
agency for medicinal products and their
[SPEAKER_03]: interpretation of the decree on the
illicit drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, in my opinion, is wrong from a
legal standpoint of view for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is that that's a decree and it cannot
be something that's against the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: That it just says prescribed in accordance
with guidelines.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if those guidelines don't exist,
that doesn't mean that you cannot
[SPEAKER_03]: prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second of all, as I said, we have
guidelines from a whole variety of
[SPEAKER_03]: countries with comparable level of medical
care.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is no reason to not use those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the current legislation on
medical is not as bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't need that much change.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just probably needs clarification and
maybe some explanation on for what
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions it can be prescribed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to make it clear, because currently
it's a bit of a mess.
[SPEAKER_09]: And who do you think would be the best one
to get the information to doctors?
[SPEAKER_09]: What can be prescribed and what not and
how and the dosaging and everything?
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is that one that could do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we already have quite some doctors
in Slovenia who have excellent expert
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge on that questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of experts from other
countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a while ago, I was looking at
literature or gathering literature on that
[SPEAKER_03]: question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is, I found, I think,
like 30 or 40 textbooks or 300,
[SPEAKER_03]: 400 pages just on cannabis and cannabis
medication for different conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there is a lot of knowledge out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So doctors, it's like with any other
thing, they will have to learn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were even talking with the universities
to include it in the curriculum at the
[SPEAKER_03]: medical faculty, because it's something
that probably needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by gathering that knowledge,
maybe the medical board should play a role
[SPEAKER_03]: here with some educational programs.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any more questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have one more question?
No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just checking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else you'd like to say,
sir?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thank you.
