[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to move right into the next
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, this is our last panel before lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get lunch, don't forget to
get a chance to go check out some of our
[SPEAKER_00]: exhibitors and maybe donate to the Lions
Club flood fund, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ICBC is going to match up to 1,000
euros.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if everybody puts in 1,000 euros,
we can drive Alex bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which we shouldn't do, because he flies me
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up now to discuss harnessing
research to move the industry forward,
[SPEAKER_00]: to lead this panel, to moderate.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a researcher at the Research
Institute and the Faculty of Health
[SPEAKER_00]: Sciences at the University of Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for Roman Stukul.
[SPEAKER_01]: So welcome to the panel about research and
industry, which I'm very excited to
[SPEAKER_01]: moderate, especially because if I remember
correctly from previous ICBC meetings,
[SPEAKER_01]: which were held in Berlin in Barcelona,
there was a conclusion made that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is one of the last emerging and
fast-growing industries of the 21st
[SPEAKER_01]: century.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we just quick look into the
numbers, in 2021, the legal global
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis market did more than 13 billion
euros in revenue, and the legal global
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp market did almost 4 million euros.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the European Union, the legal market is
estimated to be worth up to 130 billion
[SPEAKER_01]: euros by 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's likely to become the world's
largest market in the next five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see there is a lot of money involved
in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we who work in the research field,
we know that research is all about the
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is also known that there is no
growth of any industry without a developed
[SPEAKER_01]: and financially stable research sector,
which can produce next generation
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this brings me to my dear guest
panelists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have four, two from Slovenian
Research and Academic Sphere, Assistant
[SPEAKER_01]: Professor Andrea Cerenac from Slovenian
Institute of Hope Research and Brewing,
[SPEAKER_01]: Luka Bite≈ænik from Biotechnical Faculty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have two companies,
Bence representing Genesis and Klemen from
[SPEAKER_01]: Plan Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my name is Roman Stukul.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be a moderator of today's panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to quick introduction,
if we can start with the slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a researcher at Research Institute
in the Faculty of Health Sciences,
[SPEAKER_01]: where our main research activity is
related to analytical identification and
[SPEAKER_01]: quantification of secondary metabolites in
the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for this purpose, we developed a
methodology, and one year later signed
[SPEAKER_01]: still ongoing cooperation agreement with
our industrial partner, Research Nature
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to say that our collaboration was
very fruitful from the start because we
[SPEAKER_01]: have opportunity to work with very
internationally prominent people from
[SPEAKER_01]: research field of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here on the picture, you can see Dr.
Hornby, who sadly passed away last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can also see Dr. Ilya Reznik and
also Professor Hanush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our current activities related in the
faculty are related to education.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also think that education is very
important in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So together with our partner, we are
organizing educational seminars in our
[SPEAKER_01]: faculty through the Center of Lifelong
Learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in approximately 30 days, we will have
already a third edition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to invite all of you
knowledge-seeking people to come and join
[SPEAKER_01]: us on the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have credit points for doctors and
nurses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our research activity is related to
collaboration with biotechnical faculty
[SPEAKER_01]: and also with Benz's company, Genesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In both cases, we are responsible for
analytical support.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also started to doing mapping of
whole Slovenian mapping of products,
[SPEAKER_01]: which were industrial and then
unindustrial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last year, we also had a privilege or
we were invited to show some preliminary
[SPEAKER_01]: results in Kana World Congress in
Medellin, Medellin, Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that will be from my side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before I give the word to other
panelists, I would like to ask one
[SPEAKER_01]: question, which I guess ask a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think many of you would like to know
the answer to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Andrea and Luca that you are
working and your organizations are the
[SPEAKER_01]: only one in Slovenia in the research field
who, I mean, research in breeding who also
[SPEAKER_01]: have license to grow THC strains for
research purposes, which you will show in
[SPEAKER_01]: a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know the gene modification and
genome editing presents fear among many of
[SPEAKER_01]: us due to the lack of the knowledge on any
other reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for example, breeders around the world
are already using gene editing to
[SPEAKER_01]: eliminate or nearly eliminate production
of THC in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would like to know from you if your
research work on breeding also includes
[SPEAKER_01]: any gene modification technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for question.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in our breeding program are using
different biotechnology, biotechnological
[SPEAKER_02]: methods and approaches like different
molecular markers, genotyping,
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue cultures, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are using also CRISPR for in hop
science, but not yet in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are looking forward for this now
new regulation, which is focused on new
[SPEAKER_02]: genomic techniques, which will be
approved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope as soon as possible.
Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Luca?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically the answer is quite similar
to Andrea's.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't use anything for genome editing,
but we use some molecular techniques for
[SPEAKER_03]: support breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, molecular markers for sex
determination or genotyping.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I know, there is a plan in our
research group to use CRISPR on us,
[SPEAKER_03]: on cannabis, but this would be just for
research purposes, nothing for commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the moment there is a GM free plants
growing, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always nice to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will start with the panelist
presentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after we go to the questions first
from me and then from the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, Andrea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm coming from Slovenian Institute for
Hop Research and Brewing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since let's say the first relative to
cannabis is hops, you can imagine that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can use our decades of experience and
methods and labs and all other facilities
[SPEAKER_02]: for very useful breeding in cannabis
industry as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a plant breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also professor at the University in
Ljubljana for plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the first author of more than 10 hop
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which are also plant protected and we have
American plant patent as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that we can really have
successful breeding program in cannabis as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: My two topics which I would like to expose
are one, the first is more linked to
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties which are growing outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just realized years ago that in our
varieties for outdoor growing are quite
[SPEAKER_02]: different in between the population since
there are population varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in three varieties, carmineola
selected, tirbosalaceae and phenola
[SPEAKER_02]: selection, we found 11 different
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is meaning that they can be
morphologically different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our idea was that we can find let's say
correlation between red vine and high CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps in some variety and then can just
easily we can phenotype these plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: select them and have a new variety which
could be used for outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on that we have done different so
cannabinoid and terpene analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were focused as you can imagine on the
main types, components of both groups and
[SPEAKER_02]: out of that based we then sequenced also
our some spots in the DNA from different
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypes and we use different genome
sequences which are now available and we
[SPEAKER_02]: were focused on more than 40 different
traits and we found let's say correlation
[SPEAKER_02]: with high correlations with perhaps THC
synthesis, the gene which is mainly
[SPEAKER_02]: included in THC expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is one of the PhD thesis which is
doing at our institute together with the
[SPEAKER_02]: faculty of, so biotechnical faculty and
faculty of pharmacy as Professor Struckel
[SPEAKER_02]: before mentioned and show our first let's
say scientific articles.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one is we are very proud of that
because this is completely combination
[SPEAKER_02]: between private and public sector so we
have very good cooperation with Phytochem.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Czech company which is focused on
getting different products from cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plant together with as I mentioned
University of Pharmacy and Pharma Company
[SPEAKER_02]: from Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our main goal is to breed new cannabis
varieties indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an allowance as Roman already
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our goals in our breeding program are
of course high yield essential oils,
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds, high THC and high CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our first goal is high THC so we are
working indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see we have now few
generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are using molecular marker as you can
see for sex determination that we can be
[SPEAKER_02]: as much as possible efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are doing our first crossings.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have very promising first results for
high THC values and now we try to also
[SPEAKER_02]: feminization because we are trying to of
course to have the variety which can be
[SPEAKER_02]: sold by using seeds or other clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is really painful for me as my point
of view is that at the end we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: destroy all these perfect material which
could be really used for different kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical research and I think it was
mentioned also before from the other
[SPEAKER_02]: panelists that our legislation needs to be
let's say move forward in this kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: work as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are using different feminization as
I mentioned, cuttings in vivo then also in
[SPEAKER_02]: vitro techniques for different genotypes
which we are using and we are using our
[SPEAKER_02]: accredited laboratory for chemistry at our
Institute to determine all these mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much and if there are
any questions I don't hesitate to ask me
[SPEAKER_02]: later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, yes I'm working on PhD thesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I focus on cultivation of hemp and medical
cannabis and I will present you our work
[SPEAKER_03]: in a few slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is done under supervision of
assistant professor Marco Fleischmann.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our past research revolved around
vegetative propagation and selection of
[SPEAKER_03]: mother plants of hemp varieties for CBD
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: We studied four varieties with 30
genotypes per variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: We evaluate the mother plant branching
using three different pruning techniques
[SPEAKER_03]: over longer period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We evaluate the rooting ability of the
root system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically how one genotype is useful
for vegetative propagation by steam
[SPEAKER_03]: cuttings and we did analysis of secondary
metabolites based on collected data.
[SPEAKER_03]: We select the genotypes with desired
traits and save it for later research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now our attention is drawn to cannabis
grafting.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't know what grafting is,
this means conjunction of at least two
[SPEAKER_03]: different plant parts together to form a
grafted plant and we are studying how
[SPEAKER_03]: different rootstocks affects the science.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how different root system affects the
upper part of the plant, so basically the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole plant and we are studying the
morphology, physiological parameters and
[SPEAKER_03]: biochemical parameters of the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now we are also working in
breeding or we are breeding new varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on CBG genetics and CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ultimate goal is to develop feminized
seeds of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for production in Slovenia,
we are crossing for CBG, the foreign CBG
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics to obtain new ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: With CBD, we are preliminary crossing the
high CBD genotypes, selected genotypes
[SPEAKER_03]: with selected industrial hemp genotypes
and the idea is again to get feminized
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds of industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Bence has video to show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everyone, my name is Bence Matyas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the CEO and founder of the Genesys
SFL.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Hungarian company, let's say
startup.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a four years old innovation company.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are involved in both upstream and
downstream space utilization, which means
[SPEAKER_05]: that our basic research was related to
Mars.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were cooperating with the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory of the NASA.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you know this department, they are
responsible for the Mars rover's
[SPEAKER_05]: development and many other analytical
technique in order to detect organics on
[SPEAKER_05]: the planet Mars.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was an open call like four years
ago and we were at the Latin American
[SPEAKER_05]: station in the Kotopaxi volcano suggesting
to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory the most
[SPEAKER_05]: viable analytical tool which can be used
for Mars research.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we made our own experiments in these
volcanoes and also other research groups
[SPEAKER_05]: were involved in this decision,
but the choice was microchip
[SPEAKER_05]: electrophoresis based instrumentations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we established our own,
first that was a spin-off and after we
[SPEAKER_05]: make another entity, in Hungary,
we used the same technology, which is
[SPEAKER_05]: coming from space through this microchip
electrophoresis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Microchip electrophoresis is a really big
family and basically it serves nowadays
[SPEAKER_05]: medical purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: In human medicine, they use this for
cancer and diabetes too, early detection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Using mainly glycanic structures,
they are free sugars, oligosaccharides
[SPEAKER_05]: groups, and we are using it to get
information of the protein stress level
[SPEAKER_05]: before the visual symptoms appear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why it's important for us?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important also for the upstream and
also for the downstream utilization.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the upstream, because of that,
we can provide proper health monitoring of
[SPEAKER_05]: the plants in space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, for the people who are involved
in pharma business, it's not new that most
[SPEAKER_05]: of the big discoveries happening in the
international space station, especially in
[SPEAKER_05]: the Russian cabin, because the big pharma
companies sometimes rent a place for
[SPEAKER_05]: research.
[SPEAKER_05]: The researching was like one month
basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also get an opportunity, thanks to the
Hungarian astronaut program.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will launch our own equipments to the
international space station for two
[SPEAKER_05]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is for human medicine and other for
plant utilization.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me talk a little bit about the
downstream space technology, because
[SPEAKER_05]: that's why we are here and that's why we
receive this kind of invitation and
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity is that we are developing
different species-specific modules to
[SPEAKER_05]: detect early stress in plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the previous seven years, we were
focusing on tomato, indoor application.
[SPEAKER_05]: After we went outdoor and we were
measuring mainly maize and sunflower in
[SPEAKER_05]: over 600 hectares, we started in Hungary
and now we are expanding our partner
[SPEAKER_05]: programs in Slovenia as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since this year, we are new in this
medical cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our current project is to make a single
round separation for 14 cannabinoids with
[SPEAKER_05]: a portable device.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a microchip electrophoresis device,
which I can compare mostly for HPLC,
[SPEAKER_05]: which you can use.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a liquid separation based technology,
but we don't use any moving parts in the
[SPEAKER_05]: device.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we can bring it outside
without significant effort and calibration
[SPEAKER_05]: or recalibrations.
[SPEAKER_05]: This device must be calibrated after every
20,000 measurements and also about many
[SPEAKER_05]: factors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our main line is glycanic research.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically an in-depth molecular
analysis and we receive information of the
[SPEAKER_05]: protein health.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we already started to build up our
database for the macro and micro elements,
[SPEAKER_05]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can compare these changes in this
glycanic structure compared to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the farmers or the grower not only
receive information about what is the
[SPEAKER_05]: element composition or what is the element
which was uptaken to the plants already,
[SPEAKER_05]: but also they will have some reference
database and it also serves as a decision
[SPEAKER_05]: support tool in term of the leaf
fertilization and other terms.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be very useful.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the indoor applications, we are going
back to the lab because now we are testing
[SPEAKER_05]: thanks to the Nature Research Institute of
Slovenia, thanks to Bozhu.
[SPEAKER_05]: We receive opportunity to validate our
technologies also with HPLC methodologies,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is more well known in the analytical
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are comparing our datasets with the
HPLC results and also this aim or aim for
[SPEAKER_05]: this year is also get it to the national
standards with this microchip
[SPEAKER_05]: electrophoresis technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a kind of easy way in order to the
validation because this technology is
[SPEAKER_05]: coming from the capillary electrophoresis
and the capillary has a very well known
publications.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean in the literature is very well
known and most of the people aware about
[SPEAKER_05]: this, but the HPLC, which I think is in a
wider range of this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the microchip electrophoresis,
we're trying to get a bigger range of
[SPEAKER_05]: individuals who are using it because of
its sustainable features.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking about the less chemical usage.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are talking about microliters per
samples when we are using also the other
[SPEAKER_05]: reagents, which are involved in the sample
preparation and the measurements are very
[SPEAKER_05]: low and not talking about the energy usage
like also if you can compare a big machine
[SPEAKER_05]: like HPLC on the table and compared to a
portable device, it can be obvious that it
[SPEAKER_05]: has a really minimal energy and the
chemical demand.
[SPEAKER_05]: We came up with a brand called GenoPlant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the moment we have four modules on
the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are continuing for soil measurements
for the same technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are very grateful for the
opportunity to test our devices on this
[SPEAKER_05]: market and we already made a great step
already in this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think because of we started single
around separation of this fortune,
[SPEAKER_05]: also we are trying to expand our portfolio
in time of methodology and serving real
[SPEAKER_05]: market needs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll move on with Clemen and his company
Plan Z.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Clemen and I would like to
present our new technology that we
[SPEAKER_04]: developed for cannabis plant cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a stem infusion system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when my brother and I started the
company, we were very interested in how to
[SPEAKER_04]: increase yield in cannabis growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we started the state of the art,
we came to conclusions that there are like
[SPEAKER_04]: so in the world people can grow cannabis
with crazy yields right now and more or
[SPEAKER_04]: less it has plateaued.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we realized was that the reason
why cannabis cannot yield more is the two
[SPEAKER_04]: main factors.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, it can only do as much photosynthesis
as it can no matter how much light you
[SPEAKER_04]: put.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one limitation and the other
limiting factor is that it can absorb only
[SPEAKER_04]: so many nutrients through the root system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So no matter how much you fertilize,
it will only absorb so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are the two main drivers that
drive yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for this we thought about what if we
were able to deliver energy and nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: directly into the plant stem to avoid the
leaves to bypass the root system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this technology was done already on
other agricultural crops, but we
[SPEAKER_04]: reimagined it and developed it
specifically for cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it consists of three components.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is the infusions device itself that
attaches directly to the plant stem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it's a pressure splitter because you
need to provide these nutrients into the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant under pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a pressure splitter so you can
apply this to multiple plants at the same
[SPEAKER_04]: time and then we developed our proprietary
medium that contains water and only
[SPEAKER_04]: compounds that are naturally present in
the plant stem.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not adding any chemicals to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how it works?
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically after the plant has gone through
the vegetative stage, so after the regime
[SPEAKER_04]: has been switched to flower, you attach
the infusion system to the plant and you
[SPEAKER_04]: leave it on until the end of the growth
cycle, until the harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is nothing else you need to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the device then slowly injects
nutrients over time under the pressure
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything else stays the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the flowering regime stays the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fertilization regime stays the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is basically an add-on to the
operation and what we found was that we
[SPEAKER_04]: did two larger studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: One was with biotechnical faculty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Luca was actually part of that study.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are publishing a scientific paper
towards the end of the year from this
[SPEAKER_04]: study and we did another study with a
professional grower who's also here today
[SPEAKER_04]: with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can talk to him directly also.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where we looked at how this technology
impacts their regular growth line.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in both cases we were able to show 25%
increase in dry and wet flower biomass and
[SPEAKER_04]: we just last week we analyzed also the
cannabinoid content with HPLC and we
[SPEAKER_04]: realized that also the amount of
cannabinoids stays the same
[SPEAKER_04]: proportionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So concentration of cannabinoids stays the
same or is even slightly increased.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get 25% more flower with the same
or slightly higher cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this can significantly boost the
profitability and the production of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids and cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Additionally we observed no adverse
effects for the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So plants stayed healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They even looked a little bit better
because they receive water as part of
[SPEAKER_04]: their infusion system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were less sensitive to the
watering cycles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they stayed more upright throughout
growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this stage we are looking to expand
this technology to more professional
[SPEAKER_04]: growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if this is an exciting technology for
you or you are looking for ways to
[SPEAKER_04]: increase your yield, please come and talk
to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are both here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are doing pilots now with couple of
organizations so happy to do one with you
[SPEAKER_04]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everybody for these nice
presentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we still have time for some
questions from me which I prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrea, one of the main goal of your
project I saw on the presentation is to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase the yield and also the level of
secondary metabolites in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are actually the main challenges you
and your team is facing with your research
[SPEAKER_01]: group regarding CBD and THC strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the main thing is that cannabis
plant is quite heterogeneous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whenever you're doing crossings or
feminization you can expect different
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have experiences from hop as I
mentioned as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's comparable in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the other techniques can be used as I
mentioned different markers which are
[SPEAKER_02]: available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is main thing which are we doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is our let's say more or less thing
which I would like to expose it that when
[SPEAKER_02]: we will have a let's say new variety,
it's still not the legislation so far in
[SPEAKER_02]: Slovenia that we could grow that plants
under Slovenian conditions which is
[SPEAKER_02]: strange in a way because from the ministry
we just gather info let's say some time
[SPEAKER_02]: ago that in Slovenia in general we could
produce just let's say few grams which is
[SPEAKER_02]: needed for Slovenian patients which is
ridiculous comparing to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say if you make a comparison we are
the fifth producer of hops in the world
[SPEAKER_02]: and we are exporting 98% of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why shouldn't we be exporting country
for cannabis flowers as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is more or less the thing which
I'm thinking as a breeder we will have
[SPEAKER_02]: very good variety for our customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we could grow now they are preparing
the places in the countries which are
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say few steps forward regarding the
legislation like Germany and Czech
[SPEAKER_02]: Republic and I hope that Slovenia will be
there as soon as possible as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we will follow very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also mentioned that you're trying to
present I mean to make a product from the
[SPEAKER_01]: partner in the industry and able to launch
it commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you assure the standards and
which cannabis products on the market
[SPEAKER_01]: requires let's say from the field to the
final product on the shelf?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah we have for this outdoor growing we
have GACP already certified then we have
[SPEAKER_02]: accredited lab and we are in the process
for getting GMP as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are looking for different kind of
standards which needs to be used to and
[SPEAKER_02]: also we have ecological plants and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are quite well educated in getting
different kind of certificates as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luca you showed us a little bit different
approach that Andrea's team is using.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grafting of hemp is a very new method
I'm not sure if the growers know it yet or
[SPEAKER_01]: using frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So could you explain us what are the
advantages of grafting in hemp and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: what kind of benefits can we expect from
these grafted plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah grafted plants can give us many
advantages over the traditional cloning or
[SPEAKER_03]: the steam cuttings.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will start with it's normally that we
have a genotype that is really perfect it
[SPEAKER_03]: can have a profile and all the all the
secondary metabolites but it's nearly
[SPEAKER_03]: impossible to vegetatively propagate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a problem to get the roots and the
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with grafting this is really eliminated
or we can really increase the propagation
[SPEAKER_03]: of selected genotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like the first thing I would say
but we selected rootstocks so desired root
[SPEAKER_03]: system we can increase the overall yield
overall vigor of the plant the plants are
[SPEAKER_03]: more healthier the stronger overall like
the yield of flowers or inflorescence of
[SPEAKER_03]: square meter is higher but with desires or
some rootstocks could influence the
[SPEAKER_03]: activity of secondary metabolism which
means that overall yield of secondary
[SPEAKER_03]: metabolites would be higher but yeah if
the higher secondary metabolism is present
[SPEAKER_03]: in the plant means that from the start or
even late in flowering the plant is more
[SPEAKER_03]: tolerant to pests and diseases like even
with selected rootstocks some rootstocks
[SPEAKER_03]: are totally resistant to plant to to so
inborn diseases and we can eliminate the
[SPEAKER_03]: problems with pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great great you also mentioned that you
are crossing high CBD genotypes with
[SPEAKER_01]: different industrial hemp genotype what is
the purpose of this crossing?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we started from all the plants right
now are on the field like the really good
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics of CBD are hot how to say like
the federal limit is 0.3% of THC normally
[SPEAKER_03]: on the field it's THC a little bit higher
than 0.3.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our idea was in the first place to cross
it with industrial hemp to reduce THC
[SPEAKER_03]: levels to 0.3.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a challenge I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah if you want to have a high CBD level
is really really a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you say why you mean when you say
high how much so above five six percent?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah we're talking about 10% of CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other goal is we saw it from the
field that many farmers cut the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: down early in the end of the season
because of wet weather conditions because
[SPEAKER_03]: normally really good genotypes of CBD
mature late and okay now our idea is now
[SPEAKER_03]: to produce a faster flowering strain to
obtain variety that could be harvest early
[SPEAKER_03]: in the autumn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bence we'll move now to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're developing we saw microfluidics
and you also mentioned that you are
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperating with European Space Agency but
tell us how is your technology also
[SPEAKER_01]: applicable in the space and since we have
two breeders here on the panel how can you
[SPEAKER_01]: transfer your methodology to the grower or
breeder?
[SPEAKER_05]: We highlight in the video in this portable
feature with the space research because
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah why it can be used in some remote
places and in microgravity because of the
[SPEAKER_05]: capillaries so all of the separation
happens in capillaries so we don't have to
[SPEAKER_05]: like generate artificial gravity or that's
why the selection was you know narrow to
[SPEAKER_05]: the microchip electrophoresis development
so that's why the space research it could
[SPEAKER_05]: be also possibly working with HPSA because
it's also you know like liquid separation
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's much more moving parts and you
know it's much more complicated to set it
[SPEAKER_05]: up in the International Space Station so
that's why the microchip electrophoresis
[SPEAKER_05]: so about the plant specification like how
we can implement this knowledge we can
[SPEAKER_05]: provide or we are providing a nice
technological background like we are
[SPEAKER_05]: having a nice hardware but how we are
configurating this hardware it's also
[SPEAKER_05]: another thing but it's a really lucky
scenario because we started as a research
[SPEAKER_05]: group on glyconics so we know more or less
about the separations what a researcher is
[SPEAKER_05]: expecting or in this case what is the
grower expecting.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are trying to with this portable device
which we bring here today or to this event
[SPEAKER_05]: it's basically aimed to serve growers
needs or somebody who has their own
[SPEAKER_05]: laboratory or their own plantation and
they want to have measurements on the
[SPEAKER_05]: field without like hiring some experts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay maybe a second question from the
analytical point of view which I'm much
[SPEAKER_01]: closer to so we know that cannabis plant
has along THC CBD and CBG also present
[SPEAKER_01]: many minor cannabinoids which occasionally
present challenge to detect them or
[SPEAKER_01]: identify them so my question would be
about the sensitivity and accuracy of your
[SPEAKER_01]: device and what are the actual benefits as
you already said a few of them for the
[SPEAKER_01]: user.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah it's because if it's an analytical
technique like the accuracy can be
[SPEAKER_05]: comparable to HPLC or even a little bit
but you know it's hard to explain because
[SPEAKER_05]: that as we are comparing pixels to
theoretical plate numbers but we are
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about exact matches on four
decimal that's in HPLC case and the peak
[SPEAKER_05]: area is also the repeated peak area the
difference is of the repeated peak area
[SPEAKER_05]: determining the accuracy so we are and the
LOD we are talking about one in the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids between 1.1 to 1.7 started
with the CB to the THC micro gram per
[SPEAKER_05]: milliliter so yeah it's like a six decimal
error margin and the matches are four
[SPEAKER_05]: decimals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay okay thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Klemen your technology which you are
developing is a steam infusion for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants which is in a way bio stimulant but
as a grower I will be very interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: the financial scheme when using your
technology we know that probably
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial growers usually have fine
answers and they have money but what about
[SPEAKER_01]: home grower can they afford your
technology?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah so to calculate the let's say the
return on investment of this technology we
[SPEAKER_04]: used two examples like maybe the first
example is using from the numbers larger
[SPEAKER_04]: German grower of medical cannabis that has
let's say more than thousand plants
[SPEAKER_04]: selling let's say the final product at the
German average gross price we showed that
[SPEAKER_04]: the return on investment is a hundred
percent so what this means is that for
[SPEAKER_04]: every euro that they put into the device
and the medium and the technology they get
[SPEAKER_04]: two euros back in the first growth cycle
so the return on investment is pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: rapid as the 25 percent increase in yield
is quite a lot it's different for CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: there because of the price of the flower
it's the return is slower.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the home growers so our device is
completely modular so you can use it from
[SPEAKER_04]: one plant growing one plant to growing
hundreds of thousands of plants the
[SPEAKER_04]: devices stack so basically connect it's
the same device it's just connected to
[SPEAKER_04]: form large chains so for home growers they
are usually so the calculation is actually
[SPEAKER_04]: using different numbers in the end is very
similar because they typically if they are
[SPEAKER_04]: looking to sell they sell for a larger
price than what the German average gross
[SPEAKER_04]: price for large manufacturers of course
for them just having one system is the
[SPEAKER_04]: price is also higher but what we always
say when we are developing this technology
[SPEAKER_04]: is that there should be one growth cycle
that pays off for the investment and yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: so far for medical we were able to so it's
mentioned for everybody even for the
[SPEAKER_01]: single but did you mention the price
what's the price of the depending on the
[SPEAKER_04]: size but typically so for the for one
cartridge that is used for one plant for
[SPEAKER_04]: one growth cycle is 20 euro that's if you
just buy one but then you also need to
[SPEAKER_04]: have the device so the system the pressure
a system this is a one-time investment
[SPEAKER_04]: that then lasts for for many growth cycles
okay thank you so I think we are ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: the questions from the time for maybe one
or two questions because everybody is
[SPEAKER_00]: hungry or do does anyone have a question
hunger is outweighing your need for
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge alright well there it is then
let's go eat let's hear once again for our
[SPEAKER_00]: panel thank you dr. Stucco and everyone
else very informative they're gonna open
[SPEAKER_00]: that door right there in a minute and
we'll have lunch will be back here at 1400
[SPEAKER_00]: for more panels please go visit our
exhibitors over there and and donate to
[SPEAKER_00]: the flood relief fund as well and don't
forget the party tonight this first
[SPEAKER_00]: shuttle bus leaves at 845 and bring wear
your badge wear your badge so you can come
[SPEAKER_00]: to the party tonight alright enjoy lunch
we'll see you in about 90 minutes
