[SPEAKER_08]: All right, for our next panel on cannabis
social clubs, I'm going to bring up our
[SPEAKER_08]: moderator.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a wonderful person, longtime
cannabis activist out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she right now currently, she's the
partner at Groundwork Consulting and the
[SPEAKER_08]: director of communication and culture for
Pasha Brands.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it for Jamie Shaw.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, wait.
[SPEAKER_08]: I told him there was a translator.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, while we wait, I'll try to tell a
joke in three languages.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if it works.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: My Spanish teacher told me this in high
school, 1984 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a French guy and a Spanish guy
sitting on a park bench, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And a young woman walks by, and the wind
blows her skirt up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the French guy, who's very
philosophical, he says, ah, c'est la vie.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Spaniard, he said, hey,
you'll say c'est la vie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me in.
[SPEAKER_08]: I blew it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the only joke I know in three
languages.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm enjoying Barcelona very much so far.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been here two days and I've been high
for three days.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, Barcelona is nice because here people
ask me if I want weed rather than if I
[SPEAKER_08]: have weed, which is cool because
everywhere else I go, people, they always
[SPEAKER_08]: think I'm the guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you're Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_08]: Little Swing on Marley.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about now?
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, we're ready.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jamie
Shaw.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a pretty big intro to live up to,
especially when it ended up being so long.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to thank ICBC, first of all,
for having me here and for having all of
[SPEAKER_07]: us here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also want to say that I hate introducing
myself, but not so much that I won't make
[SPEAKER_07]: my panelists do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as you come out, if you want to just
maybe say a few words about yourself and
[SPEAKER_07]: your work, we'll start off with David.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think all the mics are here on the
chairs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on out, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the panel on social cannabis
clubs.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be talking, obviously, about social
cannabis clubs, but we'll also be talking
[SPEAKER_07]: a little bit about dispensaries,
retail models in different places in the
[SPEAKER_07]: world, probably mostly California and
Canada as comparisons.
[SPEAKER_07]: So David, yeah, from HQ, if you'd like to
introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, how are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my name is David.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is David Madeleine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the president, co-owner, and creator
of HQ, HQ Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: I represent here social cannabis clubs by
themselves, and this is the model that I
[SPEAKER_01]: defend.
[SPEAKER_01]: HQ is a close-knitted community of
members, but beside, it's my home,
[SPEAKER_01]: my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing is like, it's kind of
different from the other two world-known
[SPEAKER_01]: models, like coffee shops in the
Netherlands, where walk-ins are accepted,
[SPEAKER_01]: or dispensaries in the United States,
where also walk-ins are accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: In HQ, you can't walk in, so the other
member has to represent and sign for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's a big community,
for sure, but finally, it's a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are active members.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to break this stereotype of a
typical guy who smokes or he doesn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a lot of activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sport.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's music, concerts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We play basketball.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make concerts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make some art events.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of things we do every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to be here and to represent our
European model.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any questions, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we do.
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, David.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up is Dr. Dina.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_10]: I am Dr. Dina.
[SPEAKER_10]: I am not a real doctor.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm board-certified by Snoop Dogg.
[SPEAKER_10]: I started the very first dispensary in
Southern California.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have the oldest in-operation dispensary
in the United States, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_10]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I first started in the medical side.
[SPEAKER_10]: I opened up the very first doctor's office
that specialized in medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we had to find a place where we
could send our patients to pick up their
[SPEAKER_10]: medicine because everyone would ask,
once they got their letter of
[SPEAKER_10]: recommendation, they were now legal,
where do we get our cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: So we opened up a dispensary in the city
of West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_10]: We worked very closely with the city to
create regulations to allow people to have
[SPEAKER_10]: safe access.
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason why we started in the city of
West Hollywood is because there are more
[SPEAKER_10]: people living in that city with HIV and
AIDS, similar to San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_10]: than most major cities.
[SPEAKER_10]: And because of that, we were able to push
the medical side of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, cannabis is extremely popular
for people with HIV and AIDS.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know that it helps with wasting
syndrome, with pain, with nausea,
[SPEAKER_10]: all these other side effects from
medications.
[SPEAKER_10]: So because of that, we were able to get
the voice of the community.
[SPEAKER_10]: And from there, you could open up the door
to people with cancer, people with MS,
[SPEAKER_10]: people with aches and pains, people with
migraines, people with stress.
[SPEAKER_10]: And before you know it, that really means
to me, all use is medical use.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have now convinced California to loosen
its regulations in a way where we now have
[SPEAKER_10]: adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyone 21 and over can walk into my
dispensary, show their driver's license or
[SPEAKER_10]: passport from anywhere in the world,
and they can procure cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: They can purchase it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is taxed.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like buying a pair of shoes in a
department store, except department stores
[SPEAKER_10]: aren't regulated.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are more regulated than alcohol,
than pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really unbelievable what we've
created.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I first started the dispensary,
I didn't see the future, really,
[SPEAKER_10]: where we'd be now.
[SPEAKER_10]: But now we're a huge industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have licenses for cultivation,
for manufacturing, for distribution,
[SPEAKER_10]: for delivery, and retail.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I really have seen the full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the most exciting part is now the
social clubs, which we are just starting
[SPEAKER_10]: to open now in California.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's going to really change
the way that people see medicating or
[SPEAKER_10]: using cannabis, because we're going to
have a safe place to go do it,
[SPEAKER_10]: similar to what they've built in Amsterdam
and now Spain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just a quick note of explanation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bernardo will mostly be speaking in
Spanish.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I have a translator here,
and I will recap some of it for those of
[SPEAKER_07]: you that don't also speak Spanish.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bernardo, yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here, sharing the
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my name is Bernardo Soriano.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the director of SF Abogados.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a department specialized in cannabis
related matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work with social clubs,
companies dedicated to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: We introduce other companies in Spain,
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, one of the main activities that
I personally carry out, representing many
[SPEAKER_00]: other organizations, is the work of
political incidence to achieve a change in
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in a situation that is difficult
right now in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in a completely prohibitionist
framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although cannabis social clubs are a
reality, all of you have been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: visit a club in Barcelona these days,
or you will surely visit it in the days to
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to know that social clubs are not
regulated, and at any time, anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: exists could disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it's an important effort by all
of us, those that are operating in this
[SPEAKER_00]: sector, to proceed with a regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, I wanted to convey that
situation, that there are few options
[SPEAKER_00]: today, still, if things don't change in
Spain and in Catalonia, to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: carry out mercantile or other types of
operations in this sector.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bernardo said good morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Bernardo is a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_07]: He does a lot of advocacy work,
a lot of activism work.
[SPEAKER_07]: He works with a lot of clubs.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're from Canada, similar to Kirk
Tusser or John Conroy.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the States, I would say maybe Dennis
Perron, filled that sort of role.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was talking about how the social
clubs are not actually legal, and it's not
[SPEAKER_07]: so much even a gray area that it used to
be.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll kind of get more into that,
how that legislation changed and
[SPEAKER_07]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everywhere that cannabis is legal or
soon to be legal or has a possibility of
[SPEAKER_07]: becoming legal, it started as a grassroots
movement.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in every area, it started actually
fairly similar.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you look at the early dispensaries in
the Bay Area or West Hollywood or Canada,
[SPEAKER_07]: they tended to be collectives,
grow-ops.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was people who were growing,
who were sharing with other growers,
[SPEAKER_07]: who were sharing for patients,
who were growing specifically for
[SPEAKER_07]: patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot more like the social club
model than what it looks like now in
[SPEAKER_07]: California or Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then of course, there's also other
models too, such as Amsterdam's coffee
[SPEAKER_07]: shop model.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bernardo, can you explain exactly what the
social club model is here in Spain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly, the concept is that a group of
people are associated to produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity of cannabis for their
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do it in a cooperative way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis social clubs are not
companies, but they work in a democratic
[SPEAKER_00]: assembly and all decisions are made
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way of functioning that has not
been sought after wanting that goal,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was the only way to be able to mock
the existing legislation and
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibitionist framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, that's kind of the concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: As David has explained, no person can join
the club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has to be a previous cannabis
consumer, to be approved by another
[SPEAKER_00]: partner to maintain that closed circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the concept by which the first
cannabis clubs are created and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: have been working during time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other question is how things have
changed at a legal level a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so to kind of recap a little bit,
the social club model, again, like I said
[SPEAKER_07]: earlier, is very much more like a
collective.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not so much a corporation and that
members are usually referred by other
[SPEAKER_07]: members, so it's not kind of open to the
public.
[SPEAKER_07]: Earliest dispensaries, again, in North
America were very similar, but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_07]: so much being referred by other members.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was having some sort of medical
documentation, which was difficult to get.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Dina, you, like me, have experience in
those very early dispensary days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is California at right now compared
to where Spain is at or where Canada is
[SPEAKER_07]: at?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, California is a whole nother beast
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, ever since legalization hit,
it's both exciting and sad because there
[SPEAKER_10]: are so many people who built the industry
to where we are right now who were pushed
[SPEAKER_10]: out.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were not able to get licenses.
[SPEAKER_10]: And those, to me, are some of the most
talented people you want on your side.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want those people on your team.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want them growing your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, for us, they might be
moving to Spain to grow the cannabis here
[SPEAKER_10]: because there's just not that much
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's only so many licenses that are
being given out.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of big corporations coming
in, pushing out the small people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what's really happening right
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it's exciting that we're seen as a
legitimate business, although we still
[SPEAKER_10]: have the federal government looming over
our heads saying, sorry, guys,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's not fair.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's federally legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still a schedule on drug.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that means I can't bank.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I can't have a bank account under
my dispensary name.
[SPEAKER_10]: They shut me down all the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can pop up with a different management
company.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to find you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's the biggest issue right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the money.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the banking.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's how do you pay your bills?
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you pay your employees?
[SPEAKER_10]: The state's requiring that we do payroll
in a certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do you pay a payroll company?
[SPEAKER_10]: When you don't have a bank account.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have to find a payroll company
that's popping up in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_10]: that someone who was a grower maybe could
not get a license.
[SPEAKER_10]: But now they're starting a all cash
payroll company.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll come and pick up the cash from
your dispensary, and they'll pay the
[SPEAKER_10]: payroll.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're self-regulating as an industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's exciting times.
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, I think that by having the social
club license the lounge, and we're in the
[SPEAKER_10]: process of opening up a restaurant and
lounge right now, it's open.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's advertised.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can go to Yelp, and I can search for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_10]: That changes the way that people can
medicate.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here, it's like I had to do a lot of
homework to find your place.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had to send messages to people.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it made it really exciting.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I walked in, I felt like I earned it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I visited David's amazing shop.
[SPEAKER_10]: His job last night, his lounge last night.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a nice place to the community.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about building community amongst
cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we're really smart people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very hard to get inside HQ.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people that know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, David, how is it possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just right now, half an hour ago,
one guy like, David, we met yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, where?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the front of the shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, so what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I couldn't get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not making it difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like usually you have to be
signed up by the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you imagine the difference,
though?
[SPEAKER_10]: On January 1st of this last year,
when we became legal, I showed up to work,
[SPEAKER_10]: and there was a line that was over a mile
and a half long of people waiting.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going, what are they waiting for?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is some of the ironies of
legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we've seen in California and the
microcosm is you've got cities like San
[SPEAKER_07]: Francisco and Berkeley and Oakland that
had really great sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: community-oriented initiatives,
subsidized medicine, things like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then once the state legalized it,
it sort of steamrolled a lot of that stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: and kind of pushed it down.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's funny you said that, because I was in
my shop the other day, and I was talking,
[SPEAKER_10]: and there was a homeless man that came in.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I could see he was struggling and
trying to look for some change in his
[SPEAKER_10]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_10]: And normally, in the past, I would see
someone like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would go into the back, and I would grab
a joint, and I would give it to him and
[SPEAKER_10]: say, there you go, because that's what
we're here for as a community.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I cannot do it unless this man pays taxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I think if you ever federally,
I mean, I was in a different club
[SPEAKER_07]: yesterday, and it was kind of hard to talk
about legalization because they really
[SPEAKER_07]: want it to be legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, well, do you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because right now, what you're at is
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's exactly what it comes down
to.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: For me, the legitimacy, I've had a
dispensary for 17 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could walk into different social circles
throughout my life and tell people what I
[SPEAKER_10]: do for a living.
[SPEAKER_10]: And for the last 17 years, it was like,
oh, you're a drug dealer.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or oh, you're in the gray zone.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't be friends with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You might go to jail.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, everybody wants to be my friend.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody wants to know how it's business.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you need an investor?
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody is proud of me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had people, conservative Republicans,
are taking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had Republican congressmen come to me
for cannabis products because they have a
[SPEAKER_10]: bad shoulder.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just cream, but they wouldn't use
it before.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's OK.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the stigma is gone.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe that that stigma is going to
help the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once that stigma leaves, everybody else is
going to see this was not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing's happening.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are no car accidents in California.
[SPEAKER_10]: More than there were before.
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, there's less.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are less kids using cannabis because
it's just not cool anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, it's easy to get it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: An opioid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are equipped to provide cannabis to our
users.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is no more case of you don't have
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no need to go to the street and
find a dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like it's more closed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you go to a dealer and you're
looking for cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you have a child and you know that
kid is going to go buy weed, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't you rather go to a social club
and pick it up there as opposed to go to a
[SPEAKER_10]: drug dealer who might offer them and say,
hey, I'm low on weed, but I have some
[SPEAKER_10]: ecstasy and some pills.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really quite know what's in there,
but take those.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had too many friends overdose over
the years because they didn't have access
[SPEAKER_10]: to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Vancouver, what we've seen,
and this was even before legalization,
[SPEAKER_07]: is as dispensaries, as the number of
dispensaries grew, the youth use rate
[SPEAKER_07]: dropped.
[SPEAKER_07]: The age of first use dropped by a whole
year within the space of about five years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to get cannabis in the high school
didn't work.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's, I smoked my first joint in
a girl's washroom and I think grade eight.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the first time I was exposed to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think schools really see that
now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they have the DARE program.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's what a lot of kids
first introduction to cannabis is,
[SPEAKER_10]: is, you know, your brain on drugs is the
egg cracking in the pan and you're going
[SPEAKER_10]: to be toasted.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't pass the SATs, which is all a
lie, obviously.
[SPEAKER_10]: But my nephew is 13.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to not, I never told them what I did
for a living.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was terrified.
[SPEAKER_10]: This kid's going to find me on Instagram
and see my profile.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, oh God, he's old enough,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So I sat him down and I said, listen,
uh, and I really, I was so terrified to
[SPEAKER_10]: tell him.
[SPEAKER_10]: I felt like I was telling, like I was,
as a 15 year old telling my parents,
[SPEAKER_10]: I was pregnant or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like this horrible, by the way,
you know, I'm in the, I'm in the marijuana
[SPEAKER_10]: industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: He goes, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's for sick people.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why is that important?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do you care?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why are you nervous?
[SPEAKER_07]: And those attitudes change so fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: So quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I think people would be surprised.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's our future.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those kids, you know, we continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a nephew.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came like, uh, he's coming every year
to Spain to visit me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last time he was like, Hey,
uh, you know what, uncle, you gave me
[SPEAKER_01]: this, this shirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw 420 on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, uh, you know, it's a number of
the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, they know it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I know what you mean because
like, uh, last time we moved to another
[SPEAKER_01]: apartment with my wife, it was like,
all right, we, we signing the pre contract
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was good in, in two days,
the agents calling like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they just looked up your name in
Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what's up there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your name in Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but you know what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the director of the agency called
owners and they talked and we came in and
[SPEAKER_01]: they were like 90 years old, like serious,
gorgeous people here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, we explained, they saw me,
they, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's changing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very slow, but it's older generation
are actually impressed by what we do
[SPEAKER_10]: because they appreciate entrepreneurism.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like they, they appreciate that you can go
out and build a business.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the younger ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like it was like the 60 year olds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had a hard time convincing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: One time we went to see the bill with the
building before the HQ, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we opened the HQ and that woman,
she was like, what wheat?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not for our family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd rather have a bar open like bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to open the bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anytime you open a bar, you know,
there are some, you know, conscious.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is like, I don't know, like legal
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is like kids entering walk walking
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, you're accepting this,
but you're not accepting with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was in, I almost got kicked out of
Bergheim last year club in Berlin and it
[SPEAKER_07]: was, it was because of that I was smoking
a joint and, and, you know, there's people
[SPEAKER_07]: going in and out of the bathroom,
like all night long, every 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, they came up to me and it
was like, you're smoking that shit and
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a shit in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought they meant tobacco.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, no, I don't want tobacco in my
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it turned out, you know, my,
my German friend was like, no,
[SPEAKER_07]: no, no, that's what they call cannabis
shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, oh, that's a weird stigma
to kind of still have to try and deal with
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of coming back to the models.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was wondering if you could talk a little
bit about the coffee shop model in
[SPEAKER_07]: Amsterdam, for example, and how,
how certain unregulated gray markets,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's certain benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's also some drawbacks such
as, you know, you still have the threat of
[SPEAKER_07]: having your kids taken away from you or
things like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think my favorite part of regulation is
the lab testing, to be perfectly honest,
[SPEAKER_10]: just knowing that what we're getting is
clean.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's safe medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have, when I first, the legalization
first hit and I tried to look into my
[SPEAKER_10]: little, you know, crystal ball to predict
the future as to what would happen the
[SPEAKER_10]: next day.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was December 31st.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was terrified.
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know if I was just going to have
miles of a 21 year old standing in line
[SPEAKER_10]: buying the cannabis and there were small
amounts because not many people had been
[SPEAKER_10]: licensed yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: And my concern was, will I have enough
cannabis for the medical patients?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we still take the medical,
there's the adult you side and there's the
[SPEAKER_10]: medical.
[SPEAKER_10]: Medical patients can buy as much as they
want.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no limit.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't pay sales tax if you have a
medical card.
[SPEAKER_10]: They still pay a 15% excise tax,
but it's lab tested.
[SPEAKER_10]: And to me, that is the most exciting part
because you know, there's going to be mold
[SPEAKER_10]: there's pesticides.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also a minefield though.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're running through in Canada is
overly restrictive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you grow in live soil, for example,
there's no way you will ever pass testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter if it's clean or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the way they set the regulations.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a friend who failed their
pesticides or they had E.
[SPEAKER_10]: coli in their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was from their earthworms on an organic
grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, there could always be bumps in the
road.
[SPEAKER_10]: We will have the, it's going to be,
there's going to be a learning curve to
[SPEAKER_10]: figuring this out, but there's a lot of
clean product on the market.
[SPEAKER_10]: That part is great.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I noticed that when instead of a 21
year old showing up, it was, it was a 60
[SPEAKER_10]: year olds.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was all these people who were afraid to
get their doctor's note who said,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, I got a bad shoulder or I can't
sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like this, the vape pen market
went through the roof overnight.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, really incredible market.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would probably went from 15% of our
sales to 60% of our sales, which is
[SPEAKER_10]: tremendous.
[SPEAKER_10]: But with the lab testing, you have a phase
three, which just hit, which is heavy
[SPEAKER_10]: metals.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of companies using cheap
cartridges are noticing that the metal
[SPEAKER_10]: inside the cartridge is leaching into the
oil.
[SPEAKER_10]: The silicone ring is turning into ammonia.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not all perfect, but we have to
make sure we're using a good high quality
[SPEAKER_10]: product pen, surgical steel.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good for the safe end user.
[SPEAKER_10]: For sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to come back to David on process a
little bit, but first, Bernardo,
[SPEAKER_07]: how would you deal with this?
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the spokesperson for a regulations
responsible or responsible regulation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, what are the five pillars of that
organization and how, how do you want to
[SPEAKER_07]: address these types of issues here in
Spain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bueno, nosotros partimos de la base de que
la regulación de los clubes sociales no es
[SPEAKER_00]: suficiente.
[SPEAKER_00]: O sea, es un modelo que desde luego en una
futura regulación hay que respetar,
[SPEAKER_00]: pero por otra parte hay que tener en
cuenta otras cuestiones como el
[SPEAKER_00]: autocultivo, que cada persona que quiera
fumar su propio cannabis lo pueda cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: o también dar pie a la iniciativa privada
para invertir en compañías, crear
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensarios, crear cultivos y crear
plantas de transformación.
[SPEAKER_00]: Porque evidentemente como decía antes,
los clubes sociales de cannabis no se
[SPEAKER_00]: pueden plantear como un negocio,
sino realmente como una cooperativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: como una familia, como dice David,
pero no como un negocio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pero ese negocio tiene que existir porque
los clubes sociales de cannabis no son
[SPEAKER_00]: representativos del total del acceso al
cannabis en España o en cualquier país del
[SPEAKER_00]: mundo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Todo ese acceso se hace en el mercado
negro y todo eso tiene que transitar a un
[SPEAKER_00]: mercado regulado, por supuesto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y por otra parte, los clubes sociales de
cannabis no pagan impuestos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Si nosotros estamos hablando de impuestos,
salvo los impuestos indirectos de
[SPEAKER_00]: cualquier otro negocio, pero si nosotros
hablamos de crecimiento económico,
[SPEAKER_00]: de generar miles de millones de euros en
recaudación, tenemos que hablar del ámbito
[SPEAKER_00]: empresarial, del ámbito mercantil,
del ámbito de la inversión.
[SPEAKER_00]: No nos basta solo con los clubes de
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Además, por supuesto, el acceso al
cannabis medicinal de una forma segura,
[SPEAKER_00]: como decía Dina, con una trazabilidad del
producto, con unas analíticas serias para
[SPEAKER_00]: que los pacientes tengan esa seguridad en
el acceso.
[SPEAKER_00]: Entonces, desde regulación responsable,
los cinco pilares serían esos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autocultivo, clubes de cannabis,
comercio con licencias, acceso al cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal, y un sistema educativo y
preventivo de los riesgos del consumo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't think I can hit all five of
those properly, but personal growing is a
[SPEAKER_07]: big goal, access to medical cannabis,
access to education, and of course,
[SPEAKER_07]: getting the business world involved,
which is where things start to kind of go
[SPEAKER_07]: funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the same thing in Canada where
all of the black market players,
[SPEAKER_07]: all the people that got us here sort of
got pushed aside.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, in fact, it was a shameless
plug, but Pasha Brands, one of the groups
[SPEAKER_07]: that I'm working with now, is built around
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's literally designed to get these black
market players licensed and legalized and
[SPEAKER_07]: regulated in that model.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the other thing that Bernardo
mentioned was that the cannabis social
[SPEAKER_07]: clubs, they contribute to overall economic
activity, but there's no direct taxation
[SPEAKER_07]: that goes through, and that they're not
really companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're run more like families or
collectives, as we spoke about earlier.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, David, what's the process?
[SPEAKER_07]: If I wanted to set up a social club here
tomorrow, how would I do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Besides calling Bernardo and making sure I
have a good lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was my first, and they called
Bernardo.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, there is a complicated
process of getting all the paperwork done.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are specialized companies that can
help you here.
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of paperwork?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what's the name in English,
but it's Estatutos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the rules that your organization
is going to be going to buy, yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm not sure if they're still giving
the licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that in some regions of Spain,
they're not giving them at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Barcelona, we had like,
I think, two years of, they closed it,
[SPEAKER_01]: then they opened it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's difficult, it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is also, is when you want to
open a social club, you have to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: that the cultivation, the growing,
the transport is illegal here in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, no gray area, it's just
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, let's say in Netherlands,
for example, you know that they can't sell
[SPEAKER_01]: wheat, but they can't grow wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, it's what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a loophole, it's a big loophole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, the same, but the club, all this
social club system is working still just
[SPEAKER_01]: because one thing, it's the constitutional
right here in Spain to, if you're adult
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're more than 18 years old,
so you can consume your cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: privately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if I can do it myself at home and you
can do it yourself at your home,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's up if we want to do it together?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's up if we all want to do it
together?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we gather, yeah, and maybe we make a
collective crop, yeah, and we just rent a
[SPEAKER_01]: place, yes, and we set rules to be alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it, so that's how we start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone that want to get in has to be
represented by the other member,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there is no other way of getting in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very, very strict thing,
and I don't know if a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that no walk-ins is very
important in social cannabis club system.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds very similar to the way that
they deal with alcohol in places like Salt
[SPEAKER_07]: Lake City, in Utah, for example,
where they've got the private clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, yeah, because, you know,
when you said about the, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: that right now in California, you are
like, there are places, I know that you
[SPEAKER_01]: are trying to open the place, the
restaurant with the lounge, but I was
[SPEAKER_01]: there like a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found just one place in whole San
Francisco where there was a lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it changing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, is it difficult to get a
license to lounge?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we used to just be able to smoke in
the suspensory in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, for years.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we had a front room, and that was just,
you go and buy, and you sit down,
[SPEAKER_10]: you smoke it, it was normal, but there was
no food or drinks, or it wasn't like,
[SPEAKER_10]: we don't want you to hang out all day.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just smoke or joint and go,
because we have only one couch,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to rotate the couch.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, but other than that, it's very,
very different.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, the licensing started, and they
haven't given them out yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they just in the last month or so have
started giving out these licenses.
[SPEAKER_10]: So give it about three, three months or
so, and they'll be open.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gone through something similar in
Canada, where again, the early
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensaries had all smoke rooms in the
back, which brought a whole host of new
[SPEAKER_07]: problems to deal with.
[SPEAKER_10]: But see, what's interesting is in
California, similar to Spain, you go into
[SPEAKER_10]: a lounge, and you procure your cannabis
there, and you smoke it on site,
[SPEAKER_10]: and you don't leave with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the challenge for us is that in order
to get into the lounge, you have to walk
[SPEAKER_10]: into a dispensary first.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have to go into the dispensary,
and then a door into the lounge.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's all combined into one type of
business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is, I mean, it's an evolution that I
think we're going to need to get to.
[SPEAKER_10]: But how do I determine if you walk in the
dispensary and you purchase product,
[SPEAKER_10]: and then you go into the lounge,
and then can you consume that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have to buy it separately,
and then can you walk out with your bag?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, these are all problems that we
have to deal with later.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which are better problems than what we
have in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because what we've done is, well,
similar to very early medical systems in
[SPEAKER_07]: the States, where they were like,
okay, you're allowed to have medical
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis, but you couldn't grow it
yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: You couldn't buy it from anybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody could sell it to you, but you were
allowed to have it, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're sort of like that now in Canada,
where we've legalized last October.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are still some lounges around,
but they are illegal still.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because they've sort of looped things
into a tobacco smoke clause, you can't
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where we're at right now,
is where we've got illegal lounges that
[SPEAKER_07]: we're losing, and dispensaries that used
to have lounges have pushed them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, Bernardo, how would you suggest
Spain handles consumption lounges or
[SPEAKER_07]: spaces?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Spain, the consumption space itself,
the Cannabis Social Club, is completely
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has two legalities, either a gray
zone or even a black zone, is distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Spain, in a private space,
as an association, the difference is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are not spaces open to the public,
they are private spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that doesn't affect the public laws of
restriction of consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the consumption in the Cannabis Social
Club is the only thing that is completely
[SPEAKER_00]: backed up, and where there's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have to work on, and above all,
to influence politically, is for
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation, as David points out,
of cultivation and tenancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Spain, tenancy in the public road,
in the street, the cannabis tenancy in the
[SPEAKER_00]: street, they can put a sanction of 600 to
30,000 euros.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can smoke inside, but if you take
it out on the street, you face a high
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem is not consuming inside,
it's distribution, cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: transport, and tenancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, almost everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so consumption right now is actually
the only thing that is legal in Spain,
[SPEAKER_07]: but there are problems with the sale and
distribution, but also possession,
[SPEAKER_07]: and that was when I ordered cannabis
yesterday at the club, she kind of got a
[SPEAKER_07]: little nervous when I told her how much I
wanted, because you know you can get
[SPEAKER_07]: really big fines for this.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, again, this is something that
sort of changes as we go along,
[SPEAKER_07]: and do you see losing rights to
consumption as you start legalizing,
[SPEAKER_07]: and legalizing the sale of public
distribution to adults, say?
[SPEAKER_00]: In these private spaces, no, because,
as I say, it wouldn't affect public
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation, they are closed associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt that if there were companies where
cannabis was distributed, it would be very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult for it to be smoked inside,
because just like in California or Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking is forbidden, smoking in general,
in any closed space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So social clubs would be, from my point of
view, the only places where cannabis could
[SPEAKER_00]: still be consumed in regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there could be dispensaries where
you could buy and go smoke at a social
[SPEAKER_00]: club, or smoke at a social club where
maybe cannabis could only be smoked but
[SPEAKER_00]: was private.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always keeping that privacy, there
wouldn't be a problem with that
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something that, as I say,
the Spanish regulation is safe.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Fernando doesn't feel that the social
club model is necessarily going to change.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because the public lounge is not very
likely due to the same issues that
[SPEAKER_07]: California is running into, the same
issues that Canada is running into in
[SPEAKER_07]: terms of equating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're getting pretty close to the
end of our time, so I want to actually ask
[SPEAKER_07]: each of you one more question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will start with David.
[SPEAKER_07]: What would be your perfect advice for how
Spain should legalize cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no perfect advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm optimistic in that we are really years
behind of legalization right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: but let's say my prognosis, like five
years maybe, right now we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that it is very difficult and
very important to analyze all our products
[SPEAKER_01]: and to be clear with our members and try
to push the platforms such as Rosa Verde
[SPEAKER_01]: or Regulacion Responsable and try to make
them support what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as you said, maybe it's not cool
to be legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us right now, yes, because we don't
want to be neither black, neither gray
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we can't pay taxes, but you know
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: In HQ we're paying all our salaries to all
our workers by bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pay taxes from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pay taxes from all the products,
non-weed products on site also.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be very clear with open hands,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is how we operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, if someday someone's gonna
come to my door, knock and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, you're arrested, I'm like,
why?
[SPEAKER_01]: I only just to make people happy,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have just one question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the thing is like you're opening a
restaurant and a lounge together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting why, because for example,
in social clubs, we can't have a kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're making like illegal
competence to restaurants and they can
[SPEAKER_01]: claim us for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because you can't smoke inside
the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we have a kitchen inside the club,
so it's illegal, you know, like because
[SPEAKER_01]: people can't smoke inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it gets very complicated and
when you start creating regulations for a
[SPEAKER_10]: social club, you're sort of separated from
a real restaurant.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can serve food.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's definitely a wall,
there's a separation, but it's a place
[SPEAKER_10]: where we can serve.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the food is not medicated food,
but if you order french fries,
[SPEAKER_10]: we can sell you a packet of medicated
ketchup that you can then use.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's how we get around it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So something similar again, illegally.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're the experts at work arounds,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we've gotten this far.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, we've got a, there's a pizza
place in Vancouver that you show up with
[SPEAKER_07]: your oil and you give it to them and
they'll put it on the pizza for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in terms of legality, I mean,
we're going to see edibles regulations by
[SPEAKER_07]: October in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we will have legal edibles soon,
but right now they're looking at- I just
[SPEAKER_10]: care about the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's standalone production.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to have hash for two
years.
[SPEAKER_07]: You won't even have hash then,
likely.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my problem with Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's one problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's quite a few.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so what would your advice to
Spain be?
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at the other models that have worked.
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, Colorado went first in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_10]: California saw that.
[SPEAKER_10]: They saw the money.
[SPEAKER_10]: At the end of the day, that's what the
government wants.
[SPEAKER_10]: They want the money.
[SPEAKER_10]: And unfortunately, we have to kind of sell
our souls to the devil a little bit to
[SPEAKER_10]: make this work, but they will want the
money.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when they come for it, hopefully you
guys will all get licensed to be the first
[SPEAKER_10]: ones to be able to run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finger scroll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't think I'm going to discover
anything new.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing is pressure,
the lobby, and money to be able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As David has said, we need support in the
form of money, technical support to all
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations, not just responsible
regulation and many others, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Spanish Observatory of Medical Cannabis,
the Federation of Cannabis Associations,
[SPEAKER_00]: La Rosa Verde, to influence politically
and change things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no other option.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get lost talking about models,
what we would like, but in reality,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is a balloon that can be
punctured and everything can explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need is to change the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that, we need technicians,
we need influence, we need lobby,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we need money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the four things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Bernardo.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was talking about the need for support
in the industry, and I got a lobby to get
[SPEAKER_07]: legal, and that is the first step.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think where some people were
surprised when they got state legalization
[SPEAKER_07]: in different states or national
legalization in Canada is that you think
[SPEAKER_07]: once you get legal, you're done lobbying.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your lobbying has just started.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just started.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was there anything else that anybody
wanted to say to sort of finish up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and keep working on this line
because even if we can have a difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, I also agree with David that
we have to be optimistic and that if we
[SPEAKER_00]: look back six years ago or ten years ago,
we wouldn't even think that we could be in
[SPEAKER_00]: this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's work, work, work, perseverance and
pressure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was saying it's the result of hard
work, pressure, and lobbying, and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: hard to imagine being here five years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're the same in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't imagine California is any
different.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you make a lot of progress.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of problems, but it's one
step at a time, and yeah, there's still a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be leaders and not dealers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And be careful what you wish for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have time?
[SPEAKER_08]: We have five more minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
Close.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say it in English.
[SPEAKER_04]: How is it possible that the Constitution
of Spain has officially declared that they
[SPEAKER_04]: legalized the model of cannabis
associations, and how is it possible that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're still operating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it wasn't two months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was three and a half years ago,
September 7, 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a resolution that has been passed,
it has reached the Constitutional Court
[SPEAKER_00]: until the Supreme Court in March of this
year, 2018, has declared illegal the
[SPEAKER_00]: activity of that club in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be generalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's clear that we're in a difficult
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer to your question is tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tolerance and, on the other hand,
civil disobedience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tolerance in certain areas of the country
that is bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in Catalonia, there is a
greater tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model is where it has expanded the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other areas, like Madrid,
where the repression by the administration
[SPEAKER_00]: is very hard and they're closing clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're condemning people to years in
jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the legal situation is that it's
impossible for it to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can only get worse, legally speaking,
if the model is not regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's because of that administrative
tolerance in some areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that, as I said, is a balloon that can
be punctured at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that can change and get
worse always if there is no regulation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the kind of short translation of that
was that it requires different things in
[SPEAKER_07]: different areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tolerance in some areas, such as here in
Catalonia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And civil disobedience, a lot of civil
disobedience in places like Madrid,
[SPEAKER_07]: where you've got more oppressive
government policies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, hi, Bernardo.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to ask you in English.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have your organizations had any support
from, let's say, the big boys and the big
[SPEAKER_06]: girls?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can it be Spectrums, the Waylands,
the Auroras, the Tilres, who I would
[SPEAKER_06]: suppose are the ones that are really
interested in your advocacy?
[SPEAKER_06]: Has it been difficult for you to get
funding to put forth the pressure that you
[SPEAKER_06]: need to?
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that they have a certain
responsibility to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only really important organization
that we have received support from,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as other organizations around the
world, is the Open Society of the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Spain, there are many organizations
that work in regulation and there are many
[SPEAKER_00]: projects that require money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say the Spanish companies
contribute, but in a segregated way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's difficult to get the necessary
means to make a really effective campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, with the contributions of that
kind of companies, we would get much
[SPEAKER_00]: further and much faster.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you said that the only large
organization that's actually helped them
[SPEAKER_07]: is Open Society in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: that some Spanish companies help,
but it's scattered and they're smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question for, I guess,
either David or Bernardo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similar vein, Alcalibur is one of the
largest pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they allow for the associations
to take over this very lucrative business
[SPEAKER_03]: when they're better situated for the
medical cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought companies like Anacor,
for example, one of these five companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that have this huge contract and license
granted by government, they can't support
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would they?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making big money on that with
their license.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want small companies having a
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't believe in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't believe in the monopolized
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want small entities, small groups of
people if it's possible to get licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: and to follow their work because it is a
lot of experience there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this should be fair way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five companies again here, what do you
think about the Anacor?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to support you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with David,
but here we have to differentiate
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about that kind of companies,
we're talking about a strictly
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking about access to
recreational cannabis that doesn't exist
[SPEAKER_00]: legally in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be impossible to think,
apart from being a bit naive, that in a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated market pharmaceutical companies
will have this part of the cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be any other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important is that the cannabis
social club model is respected and that
[SPEAKER_00]: the private initiative for both the
cultivation, the dispensaries and the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers is supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand that the pharmaceutical
world is there and will continue to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is that recreational access
remains with the possibility that in
[SPEAKER_00]: different operators, small, large and
medium, they can enter it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, he said it's naive to assume
that there's not going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: pharmaceutical companies taking a lion's
share of medical markets in particular and
[SPEAKER_07]: that they should support recreational
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we've seen this in the United
States and in Canada where they don't
[SPEAKER_07]: really support it because they don't
really have to.
[SPEAKER_07]: They know that once we push it through,
they then have access to make
[SPEAKER_07]: pharmaceuticals out of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're kind of in this position where
they don't really have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Isa Perez.
[SPEAKER_09]: I work at Meadow.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're a point of sale company out of
California.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do all the software for dispensaries in
California.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to know more on the tech side,
your experience with software.
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, it's a little more mandated in
California, but I'd love to know from
[SPEAKER_09]: Bernardo and David what the experience has
been with actually using tech and being
[SPEAKER_09]: held more accountable from tech
perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: In California, a few years ago,
you saw a lot of pen and paper.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's easy to throw away and burn if you
had to.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to know what the similarities or
differences are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just quickly in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are using our technical support and
program we did by ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't use any other platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done by the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no book on how to open the
social cannabis club for dummies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to make thousands and thousands of
mistakes and get up the next day and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, okay, let me do it the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a huge experience in what to do
right and not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, I decided to make our own
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say that it's very complicated,
but it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, my team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Spain, more and more of these tools are
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different Spanish companies that
have developed this type of software.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are even some Americans like Witmaps
or MG Freeway that are working with many
[SPEAKER_00]: clubs here in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The complete technology cannot be used
yet, like in California, in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: or Seed2Sale, because the crops are not
really legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these tools are used to manage the
club with greater control and knowing what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens at each moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a moment in which the absence
of regulation makes these kinds of issues
[SPEAKER_00]: remain in the background.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's true that there are already many
social clubs that use them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Bernardo was just saying that the
Seed2Sale kind of software that you see in
[SPEAKER_07]: Canada and the United States isn't really
in effect here, because again,
[SPEAKER_07]: the growing and distribution is illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't promote anything from our
club outside, so that's why also.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, yeah, well, and in terms of
specifically the inventory tracking,
[SPEAKER_07]: that can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Bernardo was also saying that they do
use some other types of software.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that you probably did something
similar in West Hollywood that we did in
[SPEAKER_07]: Vancouver, where you just sort of adapted
retail software and tried to make it work
[SPEAKER_07]: the best you could.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we have Metric, which is the state
software.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so your POS system has to link to the
states, and then it has to upload.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very stressful.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very stressful.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have a Metric POS, but not the
Metric system in the US.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't use Metric yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: We will be using Metric.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name's Adam.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually happen to work at Canopy
Growth, and I'd be happy to speak to you
[SPEAKER_05]: about possibly supporting what you're
doing out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just had a question about how many
social clubs are actually opening on a
[SPEAKER_05]: yearly basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say that there isn't really a specific
number of cannabis clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They open a lot, they close a lot,
but we could be talking about about 2,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2,500 in all of Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them, almost half or more,
I'd say, in Catalonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a number that more or less remains
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we couldn't, let's say, establish a
number of clubs that open, but an average
[SPEAKER_00]: number of clubs that remain over time,
which would be about 2,000, 2,500,
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, the number varies a little bit,
obviously, as new ones open and other ones
[SPEAKER_07]: close.
[SPEAKER_07]: But between 2,000 and 2,500 is Bernardo's
estimate of what is in Spain, and about
[SPEAKER_07]: 50% of those are here in Catalonia.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are out of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm sure they'll be happy to answer
more questions as you have them in the
[SPEAKER_08]: hallway after this panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once again, let's hear it for Jamie,
and Bernardo, and Dr. Dina, and David.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_08]: We went to HQ last night, and it was a
wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I recommend that club highly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
