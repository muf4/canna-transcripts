[SPEAKER_03]: And Jim Belushi!
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jim Belushi!
[SPEAKER_03]: There he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Mr. Belushi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim Belushi, please give him a warm
applause again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I think everybody of you knows Mr.
Belushi.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a famous actor from Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_02]: From California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Playing in films like Wag the Dog,
he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a member of the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you picked the film that I had the
smallest part in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I liked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wag the Dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one scene in that, but go ahead,
keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, then let's mention K-9-11.
[SPEAKER_02]: K-9?
[SPEAKER_02]: K-9.
[SPEAKER_01]: You picked the movie that the dog was the
star in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also... You're so easy to make fun
of, I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please forgive me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually I first knew you as a member
of the Blues Brothers band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I'm a member of the Blues Brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And which is from your brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your brother was a kind of... My brother
was the original Blues Brother with Dan
[SPEAKER_01]: Aykroyd.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did it in 1979, 1980.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started on Saturday Night Live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just one of the most beautiful
movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually probably the first music
videos because all those little vignettes
[SPEAKER_01]: in the movie where they were doing songs
were essentially music videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also it was probably one of the most
diverse films made at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, the Blues Brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a great film.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at that time, as you told me before,
you were not involved in the...
[SPEAKER_02]: Show business at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that started... No, I was involved in
show business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1976, I was at the theater called the
Second City in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before that, I was in college.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there another interview going on over
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I just heard somebody talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make sure I heard their
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must have been interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so in 1976, I was at the Second
City, an improvisational theater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, let's see, 1980, I did a movie
called Thief with James Kahn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael Mann directed, was his first film.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, I think John and
Danny were doing the Blues Brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how come that you are a member of the
Blues Brothers band then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that anything to do with Danny?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he involve you later on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, it's funny because I had kind
of a separate career from John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Separate but together because John was
originally at Second City and I went there
[SPEAKER_01]: when I was 16 and I saw John and I
thought, wow, this place is magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the next four years, I was like,
I've got to be at Second City.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to Second City and learned to
improvise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And John was doing Saturday Night Live and
he was famous for cheeseburger and
[SPEAKER_01]: cheeseburger, the samurai, the Blues
Brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was a fan like you were.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were so great on Saturday Night Live
and the Blues Brothers was such an amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: film.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then John passed and then in 1992
maybe, three, Dan Aykroyd wanted me to
[SPEAKER_01]: join the Blues Brothers with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, Danny, I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was you and John.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a separate kind of thing going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, absolutely not, Jimmy,
it's like a law firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when the partner passes away,
the son or the brother or cousin comes up
[SPEAKER_01]: and takes over the role.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went, no, Danny, Danny, no,
that was John and you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be really strange for me to do
the Blues Brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely not, Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the classic parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll keep the legacy of Jake Blues alive,
keep the legacy of the American folk music
[SPEAKER_01]: alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep the glory alive, keep the spirit of
the mission of God alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You must become a Blues Brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, Danny, I can't do John.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, no, you wouldn't do Jake Blues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll do, you'll do, you'll do Brother Z,
Brother Zurashida.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll call you Brother Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be, you'll be the lost Albanian
brother lost in the caves of Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: Albania.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will search for you and find you and
bring you into the Blues Brothers band.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, you don't think it's weird?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, not at all, Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You belong as a Blues Brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only one brother that can play a
Blues Brother and that's you, Jimmy
[SPEAKER_01]: Belushi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brother Zurashida, Brother Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you don't feel weird about it,
Danny, I don't feel weird about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started doing the Blues Brothers with
Danny and we've been doing it since 19...
[SPEAKER_01]: 94, 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: We play all over the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get them, I'm trying to get
them to play here and in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know they're big Blues Brothers fans
in Germany and here and Italy and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every year Danny goes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should, oh yes, we can tour,
we can do Germany, we can do Berlin,
[SPEAKER_01]: Munich and then we can go to France and
then we can go to Spain and then we can go
[SPEAKER_01]: down to Rome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a big hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I start to talk to people about
booking a tour and I go, Danny,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got these people interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, oh, when is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, summertime?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's where all the festivals are.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes, oh no, Jimmy, I'm on the lake in
the summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every winter we talk about doing a tour in
Europe and every summer he goes,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh no, Jimmy, I'm at the lake with the
family in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if we'll ever make it,
but I try every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would really appreciate it to have the
Blue, to see the Blues Brothers in Germany
[SPEAKER_02]: one day, to see the Blues Brothers play in
Germany or in Spain or somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, I would love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would fly all over Europe and in
Albania.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the Blues Brothers playing in
Albania?
[SPEAKER_01]: We kill in Albania.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would tour Europe, but Danny likes to
be by the lake in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to the people from ICBC too,
Danny, and ask him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will look into the camera and say,
Danny, come to Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Danny, come to Germany, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, they want you in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Danny, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Danny, come to Europe, to Germany,
and to Spain, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want the Blues Brothers to be in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honest to God, the Blues Brothers is one
of the great, great... Well, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was magic what John and Danny did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mission is so great because it's
music.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know music is spiritual.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the closest to God that you can get,
is music.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sound of music, whether it's Beethoven
or a Baptist revival in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The singing brings you closer to a
spirituality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's so great about watching
that movie is you can feel, you can feel
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the movie also, you know, it had fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most important part to me was that
little phrase that Danny came up with,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is a mission from God.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those three elements to me,
I thought made, is what cannabis is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a spirituality to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is fun to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And deeply for me is a mission from God
and a medicine involved with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The healing, the pathway to healing in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a brand, I thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blues Brothers is a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a brand that has meaning to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: People connect to somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some kind of personal connection with the
Blues Brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think cannabis is on a mission from
God also in the pathway to healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought it was a perfect blend to
bring cannabis and the Blues Brothers
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're very, very passionate about
music.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're also very passionate about your
profession as an actor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it comes to cannabis,
you're born as a musician and as an actor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cannabis, it came later.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did make you become a cannabis
entrepreneur?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you gotta understand something that
as a, I gotta stand up.
[SPEAKER_01]: These chairs are really confining.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta understand something with
acting, the purpose, my purpose has always
[SPEAKER_01]: been to entertain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you entertain, when you make
people laugh, they release endorphins,
[SPEAKER_01]: which makes them feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you come to a concert with your
partner or your girl or your wife,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you might've had a little fight
in the car.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after you experience a performance,
you might be laughing and feel good and
[SPEAKER_01]: you go home together with your head up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the mission is what?
[SPEAKER_01]: To make people feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis, the wellness in cannabis
includes, oh, helps with Alzheimer's,
[SPEAKER_01]: headaches, PTSD, backaches, pain,
but it also enhances the taste of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It enhances the touch of your lover's
skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should never feel bad about
feeling good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you light, brings you closer to
the light, which is enlightenment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I'm right on purpose as an
actor, performer to drive people around
[SPEAKER_01]: and make people feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've naturally moved into cannabis,
which is another type of vehicle to make
[SPEAKER_01]: people feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a natural extension for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to Belushi's farm,
which is your place where you grow your
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, how can we imagine that place?
[SPEAKER_01]: You make me nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I making you nervous?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we imagine Belushi's farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really cool shoelaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're different than the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine are flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yours are flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, mine are, yours are kind of like
foresighted.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much for your shoelaces?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much, how much?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have them immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it would look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: One brown, one gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we'd look cool together walking
down the street with different shoelaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, Belushi's farm is a farm in
Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: About a mile, I mean about an hour from
the California border.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is the most beautiful spot to grow
cannabis because I live right next to a
[SPEAKER_01]: river and I pull the water from that river
and it's almost a perfect pH, like between
[SPEAKER_01]: a 6.2 and a 6.7.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like feeding Fiji water to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Loma soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about 292 days of sunshine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in what they call the banana belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's shaped like a banana leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: A perfect growing situation for grapes,
peaches, pears, and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the latitude, longitude, I mean I think
when God was done creating the earth,
[SPEAKER_01]: and on the seventh day when he was walking
home, he dragged his hand as he was
[SPEAKER_01]: walking because he was so tired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his fingers just kind of crossed the
soil across the globe in this beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: growing area across the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in the same parallel as Bordeaux
and Burgundy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And across the United States, the corn
belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that from Napa Valley up to about 20
miles past my farm is just, it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: Havana is for tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cannabis that we grow in Oregon and
Northern California, and I'm gonna say it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the best cannabis in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is rich with terpenes, rich with
terpene values.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC values can get very high, which I'm
not really big on.
[SPEAKER_01]: High THC values.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really believe that the combination of
maybe a 19% THC and a 3% to 5% value in
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes creates an entourage effect that
doesn't leave you with a back end of
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling a little anxious or paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a stream that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Sherry Pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a 19% THC, and the last test was
like 275 of terpene values.
[SPEAKER_01]: That combination, you know, I'll tell you
a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife, I came downstairs one night,
and my wife said, are you hungry?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, what do you have a taste for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, a cheeseburger.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, oh Jim, that's a little too
filling for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went, yeah, how about some sushi?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Jim, I had some sushi with my mom last
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, why are you wasting my time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask me what I wanna eat when you know
we're gonna go where you wanna go and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna eat what you wanna eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boy, she gave me a look like,
oh, maybe you're hungry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The next night I came, I took a hit of
this cherry pie and I came downstairs and
[SPEAKER_01]: she said, are you hungry?
[SPEAKER_01]: I went, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you wanna go to eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you wanna go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, baby, we can go to Taco Bell as
long as you're sitting across from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she looked at me like, well,
aren't you being charming?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking, am I?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really thinking cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cherry pie is the marriage counselor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this cherry pie, I have an organ just
sold out in like two months and I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it stocked because people come into
the stores going, where's that marriage
[SPEAKER_01]: counselor?
[SPEAKER_01]: He needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the combination of the THC and the
terpenes is really, I don't even know if
[SPEAKER_01]: they test for terpene values here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really one of the things to look
for opposed to the high THC levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, Blue Chief is far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's 93 acres, it's on the river.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have four greenhouses now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I documented it in a reality show
called Growing Belushi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that broadcast that you asked for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's on Discovery Plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe Discovery Plus is an
international platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to buy Discovery Plus,
whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also are releasing a distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Ant is distributing it in
different countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really documents the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really believe it's the first cannabis
show that shows us for who we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a stoner show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's getting stoned up.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this show, nobody's getting too high
and goofy and stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really about cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mission on the show is creating
confidence in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to create confidence in
cannabis for the new consumer,
[SPEAKER_01]: they need to know how it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We show them the cleanliness in which we
grow, the water in which we use,
[SPEAKER_01]: the testing in which we do, the
cleanliness of how we grow, the nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that we use that are natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I literally show them how to buy
in a store, how to use a vape pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about CBD, THC and terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not only a performer and a
musician, you're also very deep into
[SPEAKER_02]: growing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm a damn farmer, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what I was getting into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought this was going to be a fun
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a cross between Bill Murray and
Elmer Fudd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am out there chasing squirrels and
gophers and aphids and rustic mites and
[SPEAKER_01]: grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, leave me a deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, leave my girls alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like a hunter killer grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm a farmer, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm weather, I'm checking the weather,
I'm checking the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, I had some strains that I got from
Columbia that were 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it went into November and we had three
nights of 22 degrees and killed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I froze my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know why the United States subsidized
farmers and helps farmers, because it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: bitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farming is not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get a pre-roll of a cannabis
joint from my farm, it's been touched 25
[SPEAKER_01]: times by human hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the planting, to the pruning,
to the harvesting, to the curing,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the bucking, to the trimming,
to the grinding, to the putting it into
[SPEAKER_01]: the raw wrapper, to the rolling,
to the packaging, to the sealing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting a lot of loving care.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like rolling Cuban cigars,
but even more so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is so much craft care and
cleanliness because everybody on my farm
[SPEAKER_01]: believes in the mission from God,
in the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can go on for hours about stories of
how this medicine works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this medicine, this medicine,
cannabis, is so good that people take it
[SPEAKER_01]: for the side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is the other guy in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going on alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had too much coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but the main chocolate is very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie Pearson is a, I don't know if you
know here, but in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: she's a star.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is just one of the great leaders in
the cannabis industry, from the medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: to the science of this chocolate to the
healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've collaborated with her because her
heart and my heart are on the same mission
[SPEAKER_01]: from God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is great chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have any, was there a day or
something that happened that made you be
[SPEAKER_02]: so convinced of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you were not always into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in California where you live,
it's legal since six years and medical
[SPEAKER_02]: medical since I think 10 years about,
or even longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: In California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, I think everybody starts in this
cannabis business because it's a gold rush
[SPEAKER_01]: and you think there's a lot of money in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally did very well last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I broke even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Home run.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I broke even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for five years of losing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I broke even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody on my farm got paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made their mortgage payments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fed their children.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made their car payments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes me happy because it's a
real family experience on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was one moment when I was in
Oregon and we did our first grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: our first crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally, I still do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to dispensaries myself in Oregon and
deliver the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do a personal appearance and there
was, there was a parking lot and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: filled with people waiting to meet me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I go through the parking lot,
I try to say hi to everybody and I sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: see inside and show them the cannabis,
take photographs with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, by the way, that's where I
learned everything about cannabis is from
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran into a gentleman that had long hair,
blue, blue eyes, skinny, and he had a
[SPEAKER_01]: little look on his face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went, I just stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, are you all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he looked at me and he said,
you know, I was a medic in Iraq and I saw
[SPEAKER_01]: things that happened to the human body
that nobody should ever witness in their
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have what the veteran administration
said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had triple PTSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they mean by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they gave me a bottle this big of 600
oxycontin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a wife and kids and I can't
sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't talk to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was scared of the oxycontin and I
came to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, you're strange, black dog,
black diamond OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only strain I can use where I can
talk to my wife, talk to my children,
[SPEAKER_01]: and sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he kind of teared up and he
hugged me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, hey man, I didn't make this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, no, but you're a Stuart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that day when I rode with my cousin
Chris to our next delivery, I just was so
[SPEAKER_01]: moved by this, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the paradigm shift of why I'm in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one fear in life is death.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number two fear in life is the
collapse of family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And families collapse because of a death
in a family like mine, severe illness,
[SPEAKER_01]: someone in the family, divorce,
a loss of a job, a loss of a home because
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Families collapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: People fight to keep their families
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they collapse, it's traumatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that everybody is suffering
from some kind of trauma in their life
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been guiding their decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you trace it, it's about some
collapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when this gentleman was telling me he
was with that black diamond, and when he
[SPEAKER_01]: consumed it, he was able to participate in
his family again, and the fear of the
[SPEAKER_01]: collapse subsided.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe that we all suffer from
collapse of a family somewhere along the
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody reaches for medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is struggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know people who are struggling,
whether it's your father with dementia or
[SPEAKER_01]: your aunt who's suffering from arthritis
or a veteran PTSD or divorce or people
[SPEAKER_01]: suffering loss, everybody is struggling
somewhere along the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is screaming inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they reach for medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is the medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are our choices?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prescription drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their job is to soothe the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just give it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I'm saying is that the medicine in
cannabis is a better choice for our bodies
[SPEAKER_01]: and our spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, the medicine is so good,
people take it for the side effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim, what would you say, a European
doctor, we are not as far advanced with
[SPEAKER_02]: medical cannabis as you are in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're not so experienced here.
[SPEAKER_02]: A European doctor would say, okay,
cannabis has this positive physical effect
[SPEAKER_02]: and this positive physical effect,
but the mood enhancing effect is not
[SPEAKER_02]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a particle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not medical.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I hear from doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean people are thinking Prozac and all
those moods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I said bullshit, did that upset you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it the shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said shit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: God bless you.
[SPEAKER_01]: God bless you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bullshit that you left, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're missing the harmonica solo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to do a harmonica solo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pipe Piper, they're coming back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, mood enhancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course it's mood enhancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point of living through trauma,
PTSD or illness that makes you feel bad or
[SPEAKER_01]: like even with my wife, it was like it
enhanced my mood and enhanced the
[SPEAKER_01]: communication and the relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is nothing wrong with feeling good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to feel bad all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean yes, we should be introspective and
we should use those times of feeling bad
[SPEAKER_01]: to process a growth, but you know,
I say bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should feel, it's nice to be able to
feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I'm a micro, you know,
I'm a pothead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not smoking all day, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I take a little bang chocolate
at night to help me sleep or a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of chocolate or a little cherry pie in the
evening so I don't get in a fight with my
[SPEAKER_01]: spouse because the day builds anxiety,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Men and women who are responsible for
family, you know, trying to raise a
[SPEAKER_01]: family, trying to provide for them,
you know, there's anxiety with
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility and instead of drinking
whiskey, you know, take a little bang
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate or a little hit off a joint and
it's peaceful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always said, you know,
I was a bouncer in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a bouncer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never broke up a fight between two
potheads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a non-violent, generous,
kind, spiritual mission from God.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I experience from the U.S.,
what I do not experience in Europe yet,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is not such a strict distinction
between medical and recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like a, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between medical and
recreational in the United States is
[SPEAKER_01]: taxation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's all medicine, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's all medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So recreational, you know, they tax the
hell out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And medical, the people who really need it
will take a pound of cannabis and make
[SPEAKER_01]: their oil out of it in order to help them
with, you know, 106 bones that were broken
[SPEAKER_01]: from a car accident, the pain they suffer
or cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they give breaks to and taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what our, at least our European
audience might not know, in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis for medical use is taxed
differently from recreational cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're giving these medical patients a
break on the cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, it's tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And testing is very, very, it's the bottom
line for cannabis for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, illegal grows, people are
making, not all illegal grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are beautiful farmers that
are trying to make a living for their
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's a lot of cartel or
mafia that are involved and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing auto flour and you don't know what
pesticides they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know the carpeen values,
the THC values.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the medical cannabis and the
recreational cannabis is very well tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know what you're consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's go to, let's go back to South
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where your farm is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if the audience knows
that ICBC is also coming from South
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon, original, from Ashland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, Ashland, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about 30 minutes from my farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, ICBC is born in Ashland,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex Rogers, who is the CEO of ICBC,
the founder of ICBC, he lives in Ashland.
[SPEAKER_02]: He comes from Ashland.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I wanted to say I tried wheat
from Southern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to admit, it was grown outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had very, very high THC levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was high on terpenes and it was all
bio also.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no pesticides in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the, let me say the best wheat
I had on my trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the legalization in the
United States, federal legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: is a tough road because now not only do
you have people who don't understand
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and why it should be legal
fighting it, you have states that are
[SPEAKER_01]: legal that are loving the taxation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tax the farmer, they tax the
distributor, they tax the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: they tax the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's permits, licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's about eight different
revenue streams for the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once they legalize it and the state
borders come down, they all know that
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon and Northern California grows the
best wheat in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to be shipping it to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going, no, no, no,
no, no, we don't want to give up all that
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to promise to ship some to
Germany as well, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, I can't even see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot send anything to Germany across
state lines that is completely illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am a license holder of cannabis
wholesale and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am the poster child for compliance
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that when they give you the
legalization, they give you the license,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they are making you their partner and
you have to be an honorable partner and
[SPEAKER_01]: stay as legal and compliant as possible
and as partnership will grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no complaints about the regulations
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think is my last question
about cannabis administration things?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about federal
legalization, which means that you may
[SPEAKER_02]: ship your wheat from Oregon to California
one day?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that coming or is that coming?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming really close until you follow
the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you follow the money,
the states that are legal, I just said
[SPEAKER_01]: this, the states that are legal want to
keep their tax dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I don't know if they're going to,
I think it's farther down the road than
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd like, but I do think there's a
possibility of them changing some banking
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations so it can help the
dispensaries and the farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not deal with so much cash because when
there's a lot of cash around, it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: welcoming to crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked a lot about Oregon,
about California, but we are sitting here
[SPEAKER_02]: in Spain right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Spain also has kind of a nice system
for cannabis because it's decriminalized
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you try any Spanish?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're not a stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: But did you see, did you try?
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Choco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see or try any Spanish cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to Choco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Choco?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you enjoy it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How was the menu?
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people were very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resident was very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vincent, the manager was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Janet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in the United States,
they have pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've gotten very lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here you have the roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: You roll your own.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Janet was very nice to roll the joint
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't partake.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised of all the Europeans
mixing tobacco with the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard that from an American.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, when I was 16,
we used to take a little weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd take a cigarette, and we'd kind
of roll out the tobacco and put the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: into the cigarette to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I started smoking in the US when I
was 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was my first cannabis experience in
the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I had seen it in Germany,
they mix it with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they wanted to kill me, my friends,
at high school there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, how can you mix tobacco and
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a deadly sin, considered as a deadly
sin, I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's pretty self-righteous of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again?
[SPEAKER_01]: You tell them to smoke their weed the way
they want to, and you're going to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: your weed the way you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, foul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I lose anybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie, you're still here?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not being offended by that?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I hate offending people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bullshit's a big, big word.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, I think you can smoke it the
way you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everybody has their preference,
just like the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't already like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really like watching somebody put
ketchup on their scrambled eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you put ketchup on your scrambled
eggs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, shut the fuck up,
Belushi.
[SPEAKER_01]: You eat your eggs the way you want to eat
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, all right, all right, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't think there's a necessity to
overregulate anything on cannabis or to
[SPEAKER_02]: regulate it too detailed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't quite understand what you asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked you if you think there's a
tendency to overregulate cannabis and
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational medical cannabis to have too
strong rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe states like Colorado and
Oregon, even Washington, they've been in
[SPEAKER_01]: the game for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially Oregon, they're very
amenable to understanding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they change their regulations as they
grow with the understanding of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think states like California,
should have talked to Oregon and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they did talk to them,
but said, yeah, yeah, we're California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do it the way we want to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their regulations are very
conflicting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the taxation and some of the
regulation is just anti-productive at
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a movement to try to get them
to straighten it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're a little stubborn.
[SPEAKER_01]: California is a, I'm not even in the
California market because it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a little screwy right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully they'll get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, Europe should look at Oregon
and Colorado and see how they do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the testing and the safety and the
protocols and the metric, the tracking is
[SPEAKER_01]: sensible and responsible and protects the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was a very good final word.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are close to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are close to, we're nearly finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything you want to tell the
audience before they leave?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've been telling you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else, anything special?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything special.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your best train, for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would like you to see Growing
Belushi.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a wonderful show and simpatico to our
cause and purpose on Discovery Plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking forward to walking you
through the convention tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bain chocolate will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Foch lighting, which is an LED lighting
system that we just put into our grow that
[SPEAKER_01]: increased our grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yield by 30% and the tripping values.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do a hybrid grow, lights and?
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil, we're in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beds, we're in beds in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't take the aphids and the rustic
mites anymore and the gophers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went into greenhouse because
greenhouse still has the spirituality and
[SPEAKER_01]: the power of the father son.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also a nice protected environment
from the elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're having great success in these
this lighting system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we switched to advanced nutrients,
which really, really I'm very pleased at
[SPEAKER_01]: the results because the results aren't
subtle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like this last greenhouse we grew
with advanced nutrients next to our other
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse was like, I'm on two different
farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this this this nutrient, advanced
nutrients is spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, between the light,
the sun and the nutrients, and of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: the water we use from our river,
we believe we're growing the some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: finest cannabis in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every grower says that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't listen to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm full of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm bullshit is what I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim, I thank you very much for the
interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys got something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have any questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody have a question?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've written it down, so I don't forget
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a high profile cannabis farmer,
to what extent do you feel a
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility, I guess, for one of a
better term to kind of push the
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization agenda sort of in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and internationally?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that the Steve D'Angelo Steve D
'Angelo is the godfather of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States, and he is really the
most articulate and active guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still chasing gophers, but I do
believe in the last prisoners project and
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve started the United States,
which is a program where we are working
[SPEAKER_01]: diligently with lawyers, state's attorneys
to release some of the 30,000 nonviolent
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis people that are incarcerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been having some great success.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these men and women that are
incarcerated, we're the pioneers in our
[SPEAKER_01]: business, and they are in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are with collapsed families,
because when someone is incarcerated,
[SPEAKER_01]: it collapses their family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are making money on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's telling a better joke than me
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know who that might be,
but they're having a good time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They must be dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that help?
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Jim, for this passionate
interview.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your statement on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: You say mood and enhancing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But my question is, will you be ready to
support maybe a trial, a clinical trial,
[SPEAKER_06]: to prove it according to the principle of
evidence-based medicine as known in the
[SPEAKER_06]: scientific world for a while?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I want to take the example of
aspirin.
[SPEAKER_06]: 120 years, and for the last decades,
around about $1 billion average sales per
[SPEAKER_06]: year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So making something like that could give
the possibility to make sales worldwide
[SPEAKER_06]: and support lots of people who need that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that, OK?
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of us are convinced that cannabis
really have lots of potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you could be the one supporting
something like that and make this
[SPEAKER_06]: revolution happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't quite understand that long
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would I support the legalization of
medical cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Expanded testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Expanded testing for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: To put it on equal footing with,
say, aspirin?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the laws are here in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the United States, because it's
federally illegal,
[SPEAKER_01]: people that receive their licenses from
the federal government doctors,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they dabble in cannabis, they can lose
their license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most doctors don't even know the
medical benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they have 12 informative
seminars a year on all different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs, but there's not one for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even know to recommend to their
patient with baritis cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't do it because they'd be
frightened to lose their license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the testing is really behind,
but there is some headway.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I can say for Europe, in Europe we
have testing, testing is regulated by the
[SPEAKER_02]: federal governments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly it's the same in countries with
illegal medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They test it for THC in Germany and in
other countries for CBD, for mold,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, as a company, you can test it for
turbines and you also can test it as a
[SPEAKER_02]: company for other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're not allowed to publish those
results because it's a medicine and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not allowed to make advertisement for a
medicine in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And due to that, you're not allowed... You
lost them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You lost them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't say bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it something we said?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your heart, you have an heart attack?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any more questions from the audience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I think we are close to...
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say thank you because one thing
we forget, marijuana is human.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you are real.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you say, I want to give you a present
because you speak about gentrions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to give you that from Big Mike.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you to be real.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to keep marijuana human.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The music was perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Mike, another cannabis pioneer from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, thank you, Big Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for being at the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to Berlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come to Berlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Berlin is in July.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get the VIP ticket for 420 euros.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.
