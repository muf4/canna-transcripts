[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to start off by thanking ICBC
for inviting me to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is my fifth or sixth time
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm going to talk about some of the
economics of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: First going to talk a little bit about the
global market and then the US market and
[SPEAKER_00]: then do a little bit of a deep dive into
the German market.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit about Whitney Economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a global leader in business data,
economic research, as well as consulting
[SPEAKER_00]: both in the adult use and medical market,
but also in the industrial cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have clientele all over the world and
practically every continent except for,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, Antarctica.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the global marketplace,
there's over 70 countries now that have
[SPEAKER_00]: some form of access to cannabis,
either adult use, medical or some type of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, CBD, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for this reform is different
from country to country to country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some want economic development,
some want access and to medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people want alternatives,
but this reform is taking an accelerated
[SPEAKER_00]: pace now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a combined basis, the cannabis industry
is about a trillion dollar global
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this is driven by industrial
hemp, but then you've also got the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: and adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about one third cannabis and two
thirds hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the US is driving a lot of the
narrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're driving the policies at the UN
level, international, but the market in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States is so dysfunctional that
there's a possibility that the European
[SPEAKER_00]: block could displace the US as a global
leader in driving direction and reform
[SPEAKER_00]: globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a US update.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did here is we've tracked the US
market and then we projected out the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the growth is coming from the new
markets that are deploying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, surprisingly, to some 10 states
out of the 38 that have deployed some type
[SPEAKER_00]: of legal cannabis, 10 states actually
showed negative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonetheless, overall, the market eeked out
some growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're forecasting 12% growth this year and
then it should really take off by 2025.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for the sluggish growth last
year was that there was a return to work,
[SPEAKER_00]: a return to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: People didn't have as much opportunity to
consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result of that, the demand shifted
back down to pre-COVID levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there was a change in consumer
behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, in the US, the consumer would
spend about the same amount each time that
[SPEAKER_00]: they go to a dispensary or retail outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all the narrative about inflation,
about potential recessions and the like,
[SPEAKER_00]: right in the August, September time frame,
they pulled back their spending.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a downward shift in the basket
amount that they spend each time that they
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the retail outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really impacted the market and took
down the overall demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with that, our forecast accuracy was
93%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't do that bad of a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 98% the year before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a pretty good pulse on what's
going on in the US market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to see much growth until
2025 and then it'll really take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've forecasted the European market on a
total addressable market basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the total number of consumers,
illicit, legal, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we applied a spending pattern to that
and then we projected out what the total
[SPEAKER_00]: demand is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty sizeable market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually the second largest market by
spends, but it's a pretty small market
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to other markets like Africa or
Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of examination of reforms,
a lot of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the German market and the Czech market
and their policies, if they team up,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they could really be the catalyst in
further reform and growth in the European
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just a total addressable market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty sizeable market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five countries really dominate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be surprising that Italy is up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's based upon some UN data that shows
the total number of consumers that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have used cannabis in the
previous year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have higher consumption patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonetheless, it's a real sizeable market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending upon if you use the UN data,
which has some limitations on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you use our data, we actually show
that there's more consumers than what the
[SPEAKER_00]: UN is saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's potential of 150 million
consumers if you expand the market out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Russia and other periphery countries
within the EU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, back in 1850, a little history
lesson, the Czech Republic and Germany got
[SPEAKER_00]: together and they defined the regulations
or standards for Pilsner beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That became the de facto standard for the
rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an opportunity here for Germany
and the Czech Republic, who are both
[SPEAKER_00]: considering reforms, to do the same thing
and set the standard for the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, is there enough motivation
right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there going to be a champion within
these markets to do so?
[SPEAKER_00]: The jury's still out on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the briefings earlier, or yesterday
and the like, there's a reason to be
[SPEAKER_00]: optimistic and there's a reason to be
pessimistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, last year, I presented some data on
what the ramp would look like if they
[SPEAKER_00]: deployed full federal legalization in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ramp actually was, and we look at
things in terms of the percentage of legal
[SPEAKER_00]: capture, the amount of participation in
legal markets and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ramp scenario for Germany last year
was that they would have a greater capture
[SPEAKER_00]: than the US, but a little bit less than
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pretty successful ramp that was based
upon last year's policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those policies have since changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The demand has been significantly shifted
downward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The percentage of legal participation has
been shifted downward as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cut the legs off of this
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's important when you're
looking at this from a business
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective and you're trying to find
where the opportunities are to see this
[SPEAKER_00]: potential growth last year and now not so
much, then it really plays a role in your
[SPEAKER_00]: decision making on market entry strategies
and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a revenue projection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the efforts of Metric and
their presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take a little bit different approach
where we look at the legal markets and
[SPEAKER_00]: we've mapped out all these ramps and then
we look at the regulatory structures in
[SPEAKER_00]: each one of these markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result of this shift to the social
clubs, it's really pulled down the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential forecast through 2030.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, this is roughly a $4 billion
market by 2030.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now an $800 million market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty significant haircut just
based upon policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to note also that
although there's been a downward shift in
[SPEAKER_00]: the market, in the market projections,
one has to be prepared for another shift,
[SPEAKER_00]: another pivot in this space and really be
ready to ramp at a rapid pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of German supply requirements,
the total addressable market requires
[SPEAKER_00]: about 950,000 kilos of cultivated output.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's output that's required for not only
flour and pre-rolls, but for your edibles
[SPEAKER_00]: and your tinctures and your extracts and
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 950,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty sizable market, but as we
can see, there's really, I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: right now at this point that there's
enough capacity online to support the
[SPEAKER_00]: demand, even at the lower numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The orange was the ramp scenario from last
year and the requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, I said, I put out some
warnings to the German government and I
[SPEAKER_00]: said, hey, look, I don't think you have
enough capacity and it's gonna take time
[SPEAKER_00]: to ramp and you're gonna inhibit your
growth and the amount of conversion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers, but even with the lower
downward revisions based upon the social
[SPEAKER_00]: clubs, I'm still skeptical that there's
enough capacity online to support this
[SPEAKER_00]: potential ramp, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the jury's still out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Implication.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the slower rollout, the business
opportunities are smaller, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: still opportunities there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to be strategic and use
data in order to ascertain where the
[SPEAKER_00]: markets are, what the potential are,
and then be prepared to scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the fact that there's a limited
amount of supply, there's opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: there to fill that void.
[SPEAKER_00]: The success of a regulated rollout depends
upon three variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's supply, if you have enough supply,
and if you have enough supply,
[SPEAKER_00]: then prices are moderate, they come down,
it incentivizes a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumers are very price dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at price and they'll participate
in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's an incentive to do so,
they're willing to pay a premium just as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as the premium is not too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Price is another one of those factors that
plays a role in the amount of legal
[SPEAKER_00]: participation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then access.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a lot of retail outlets,
there's a lot of legal participation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a reasonable product,
a lot of access, you have reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: supply, then that's a successful scenario
for a launch.
[SPEAKER_00]: A regulatory rollout.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have one or two of those
factors, then it's gonna be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't eliminate the legal conversions
by consumers, it'll just slow it down
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could turn very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get more access and more clubs,
more retail potential, then there could be
[SPEAKER_00]: a quick turn in the overall market and
increased opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be remiss if I didn't talk a little
bit about the industrial side of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a strong market in the EU for
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put together this chart a while ago,
but it still seems to resonate with
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's applications in traditional
markets to convert over to hemp on a more
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of incentives on the ESG,
so environmentally friendly, bringing in
[SPEAKER_00]: more opportunities for minority
communities and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with just a modest conversion,
it's a sizable market for the industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Germany, there's the automotive
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: BMW already uses, I think, 20% of their
cars are made from parts derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already this conversion going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could accelerate in the area of
fibers for construction materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: for plastic replacements, plant-based
plastics and the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of potential to the hemp
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EU right now is taking the lead,
displacing the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking the lead with regard to
hemp policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My firm has country reports for 27% in
countries in Europe on the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks at rules and regulations on the
industrial side as well as adult use and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to regulatory rollouts,
like I mentioned, price, access,
[SPEAKER_00]: supply, it's really important to have
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, regulators will copy and
paste from other rollouts in other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries, other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, they bring in policies that
haven't worked in previous markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important to be mindful when
deploying the regulations to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you meet multiple goals, such as
public safety, as well as presenting and
[SPEAKER_00]: providing a good, healthy business
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, there's an opportunity to
displace the US in terms of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: policy, but it's going to take a little
bit more work by the federal regulators in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the industry, as stakeholders
in this space, it's really important to
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate not only with regulators but
amongst yourselves, develop networks,
[SPEAKER_00]: set expectations that are reasonable
relative to the market size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data plays a real big role in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get too far out over your skis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's examples out of Canada,
examples out of the United States and
[SPEAKER_00]: other markets where they built too much
capacity, didn't have enough, drove up
[SPEAKER_00]: their costs, and the prices crashed,
and they didn't have a good cost control,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so they weren't making any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important to be disciplined
and look at your cost structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also important because cannabis is so
localized, cannabis policy is so
[SPEAKER_00]: localized, it's important to act locally
but to think on a global basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in the United States,
the cost per gram to produce cannabis runs
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 cents to 50 cents a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some countries, the wholesale price is
a penny a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as the international markets open
up, this could be a serious threat to the
[SPEAKER_00]: US market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to be mindful of where
things are going on around the world just
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as it's important to track things
going on locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the future, if Germany does
become the first major market in Europe to
[SPEAKER_00]: roll this out, they have a potential to
really shape the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even on the hemp side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the fact that this is now home grow
and social clubs don't expect significant
[SPEAKER_00]: increases in legal usage, there's just not
gonna be enough supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just not gonna be enough access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once policies change, then there's going
to be an opportunity for accelerated
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to plan for that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also there's an opportunity here
for can of tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: People come to Germany to consume in the
clubs if they are able.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be short lived because once
reform takes hold across the EU sector,
[SPEAKER_00]: then there'll be less and less can of
tourism because they'll have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in their home country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also look for prices to really
normalize once the rollouts are complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get more capture because
initially because of the limited amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: supply, you'll keep higher prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once supply normalizes and is in
equilibrium with the demand, then prices
[SPEAKER_00]: will normalize and they'll shift downward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens in every market.
[SPEAKER_00]: In sum, there's great potential here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little less potential than there
was a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows, there could be additional
opportunities as things evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to thank you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my contact information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got data on every country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at ramps in every state,
every country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of data, a lot of insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
