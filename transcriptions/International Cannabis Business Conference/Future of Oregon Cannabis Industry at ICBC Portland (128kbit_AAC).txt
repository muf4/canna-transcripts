[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next panel, the future of Oregon cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will first lead off with kind of good
news, the kind of big picture,
[SPEAKER_05]: some things we can all be proud of.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I want to mention when we first
legalized or first started working on
[SPEAKER_05]: Measure 91 to legalize cannabis here in
Oregon, there were 12,808 Oregonians who
[SPEAKER_05]: were arrested and cited for cannabis in
2012.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are the latest stats when we
started the campaign.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year, using those same statistics,
for people arrested for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: where cannabis was like the reason they
were arrested, that was the most harmful
[SPEAKER_05]: thing they were charged with, it's down to
47, all right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So 47 people arrested and cited for
cannabis last year, all right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And 16 adults, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: 21 juvenile, 16 adults.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can be proud of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can also be proud of the fact that,
as Senator Merkley mentioned in his video
[SPEAKER_05]: this morning, we have doubled what the
state projected tax revenue would bring
[SPEAKER_05]: in.
[SPEAKER_05]: They projected 40 million at the most
every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're on pace to bring in 80 million every
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we doubled that projection,
funding schools, drug treatment programs,
[SPEAKER_05]: putting that money to good use.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we could put it to other good uses
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've created, I think Governor Brown
projects, we've created 19,000 or so
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis jobs that have been created.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we got more work to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to take care of patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to sell more cannabis,
both in-state and out-of-state,
[SPEAKER_05]: and address some other issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me introduce the panel at large and
then I kick it off.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I have a lot of experience working
with all these fellows.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all great people.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the far end, Sam Chapman, Director of
New Revenue Coalition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam helped lead the effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of it for Sam, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam helped lead the effort to legalize
medical cannabis dispensaries in the
[SPEAKER_05]: legislature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now he's at the legislature leading
the effort to legalize cannabis cafes and
[SPEAKER_05]: other similar businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about the cannabis model for winery
tours, distillery tours, things like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: to bring more tourism to the state,
provide more jobs for our industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next to him, Casey Hulhan, Oregon
Retailers, Oregon Retailers and Cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: Association.
[SPEAKER_05]: Casey worked with us on Measure 91.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did a great job working with the
legislature to protect the industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: the retailers who are the point of contact
with the general public.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in many ways, they're the ambassadors
for the program.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next to him, Adam Smith with the Craft
Cannabis Alliance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam works with Mom and Pops and he is
leading the charge with One Fix Cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: to make sure that Oregon is ready when the
time is right, and I think the time is
[SPEAKER_05]: now, to start exporting cannabis across
state and international lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then one of our biggest allies in the
legislature, Oregon Senator Floyd
[SPEAKER_05]: Prizanski.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sam, why don't you take it away,
talk about what we're working on with the
[SPEAKER_05]: New Revenue Coalition and the reasons why
we got to legalize and regulate cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: cafes and other businesses here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Anthony.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, Sam Chapman, New Revenue Coalition.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to learn more about us,
then newrevenuecoalition.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we founded the New Revenue Coalition
because there needed to be an organized
[SPEAKER_07]: path of industry members along with folks
who are not in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_07]: who may just be consumers or social
justice advocates or housing advocates or
[SPEAKER_07]: equity advocates to really reframe the
issue and the current problem that we have
[SPEAKER_07]: with our existing model of legalization,
which that more or less, it is a
[SPEAKER_07]: privileged form of legalization and that
if you don't own your own home,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's likely no legal place for you to
consume your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something that we're working on
addressing in this legislative session.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got a bill into legislative council
right now that would do a couple of
[SPEAKER_07]: things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really quickly, I just want to get a
raise.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many retailers are in the room?
[SPEAKER_07]: Retailers?
[SPEAKER_07]: Production?
[SPEAKER_07]: Processing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: You stand to benefit from this bill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single one of you stands to benefit
from this bill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me tell you why.
[SPEAKER_07]: The first and main core concept that we're
looking to do with this bill is to exempt
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis from the Indoor Clean Air Act.
[SPEAKER_07]: For those of you who don't know,
cannabis was added in 2015.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that means that you can't consume
cannabis inside.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very straightforward.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that created, again, quite a few
problems for folks who don't own their own
[SPEAKER_07]: homes, especially if you're in any type of
government-assisted housing.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a law that was just passed
federally that all federal housing is now
[SPEAKER_07]: smoke-free.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the current law disproportionately
affects people of low economic status and
[SPEAKER_07]: people of color.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that we've really got an
opportunity to address this in the
[SPEAKER_07]: upcoming session.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what does the bill do?
[SPEAKER_07]: One, it allows retailers to co-locate a
consumption venue at their premise.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two, it extends that same ability to
processors and producers.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to have a brewery or vineyard
model at your farm or processing facility,
[SPEAKER_07]: we think you should be able to do that,
just like the wine and brewery industries.
[SPEAKER_07]: Three, delivery to hotels.
[SPEAKER_07]: The current law does not allow delivery to
hotels.
[SPEAKER_07]: We think that that's something that should
be allowed.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're a tourist and you're coming to
town, you should not have to walk around
[SPEAKER_07]: the corner, smoke in an alley,
in a park, or in your rented car.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are public safety issues,
in our opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we think that those need to be
addressed with sensible solutions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And three, cannabis temporary event
licenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, this is not reinventing the wheel.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have this for liquor now.
[SPEAKER_07]: The language that we've used and put in
the bill that we have at the moment
[SPEAKER_07]: directly reflects existing language for
alcohol temporary event licenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that is the general concept of the
bill.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that the really important
thing for people here to recognize is that
[SPEAKER_07]: this is not a done deal, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is actually the second, and maybe
depending on how much context you have in
[SPEAKER_07]: previous sessions, second and a half
attempt at pushing this through the
[SPEAKER_07]: legislature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let me give you a little context.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2017, I helped author and ran a bill,
Senate Bill 307, that sought to simply
[SPEAKER_07]: create a space for people to consume at
retailers, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the folks that we need to work with
and that we at least need to get to
[SPEAKER_07]: neutral, are public health and law
enforcement, and mainly public health.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a lot of the same reefer madness
concerns that we have heard for decades.
[SPEAKER_07]: They also have some legitimate concerns
that we very much need to address.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that it's really important
that the industry knows that, in that
[SPEAKER_07]: there will be concessions in these
conversations, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: If I had it my way, you'd be able to buy
cannabis and alcohol and consume it in the
[SPEAKER_07]: same place, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not there yet, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are incremental aspects of this
political process that we need to go
[SPEAKER_07]: through.
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2017, we took our first step in that
process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had a bill that would allow this to
happen at retailers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had three stakeholder group meetings.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in every meeting, we compromised.
[SPEAKER_07]: We compromised, we compromised.
[SPEAKER_07]: And by the third meeting, the bill had
been watered down so much to where it just
[SPEAKER_07]: codified existing law, which, in my
non-legal opinion, means if you're
[SPEAKER_07]: outside, not on an OLCC licensed premise,
and you're not in view of the public,
[SPEAKER_07]: you can consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was what public health told us that
they needed to go neutral.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it turns out they weren't very
genuine in telling us that because they
[SPEAKER_07]: still opposed our bill.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're coming in with a very different
strategy for the 2019 session.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's politics, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I do my best every day to make sure that I
don't take those things personally.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's part of the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can play that game, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that part of the new strategy
this time around is, one, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: we're asking for everything we want,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything that we deserve.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we understand that that may be a tall
order for some folks who may not quite
[SPEAKER_07]: understand who we are and that we're also
normal people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just have a different, you know,
choice to, we choose a different way to
[SPEAKER_07]: relax or we just, you know, we're not the
same exact people.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do believe that it's something that
we deserve the freedom to have.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically what we're doing is we're
gonna work with public health and law
[SPEAKER_07]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're genuinely coming back to the table
with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a first, what I believe to be a
very productive work group meeting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, I think that we've got a
real shot at getting this through the
[SPEAKER_07]: building this session.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not gonna be done without two
major things.
[SPEAKER_07]: One, a well-organized and well-financed
lobbying effort.
[SPEAKER_07]: And two, a community organizing bottom-up
lobbying effort.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not an issue that is going to get
passed just through top-down lobbying.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to require constituents to
be activated, consumers to talk to their
[SPEAKER_07]: representatives, to set up meetings and
say, I deserve a legal place to consume
[SPEAKER_07]: this legal product.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we're not, if we can't do that,
this will not pass.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if you live here in Oregon and you
are willing to contact your
[SPEAKER_07]: representative, send an email,
host a house party, volunteer in one way
[SPEAKER_07]: or another, if you've got a special skill,
I want to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's gonna take all of us to get
this done.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not just going to be the
lobbyists in the building.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gonna need to be the people and the
voters that let their representatives know
[SPEAKER_07]: that they want this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the other aspect of the strategy is if
we are not able to get something through
[SPEAKER_07]: the building this session, we're simply
gonna go to the ballot.
[SPEAKER_07]: That ruffles a lot of folks feathers,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a card that we have to keep in
our back pocket.
[SPEAKER_07]: If folks that we are required to work with
in the building are not willing to work
[SPEAKER_07]: with us, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another avenue that we can go to.
[SPEAKER_07]: And frankly, with 578 retailers in the
state, most of which would stand to
[SPEAKER_07]: benefit in one form or another from this
bill, we think that those retailers act as
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty great conduits to constituents,
to consumers, to voters.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's plenty of campaign plans out
there that can show us how to utilize
[SPEAKER_07]: those connectors to organize a groundswell
of constituent support.
[SPEAKER_07]: The legislature has never seen on a
cannabis issue like this before.
[SPEAKER_07]: This issue of consumer equity is one that
stands to mobilize consumers in ways that
[SPEAKER_07]: you've never seen before.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that on top of the
opportunities that are presented in that
[SPEAKER_07]: type of organizing model, it also really
is something that you should consider as a
[SPEAKER_07]: business decision.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're in the cannabis industry,
you already know your business is
[SPEAKER_07]: politics.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all politics are local.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're not paying attention to
local politics, you're probably not paying
[SPEAKER_07]: attention to your business very much,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: The same is to be said for this issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's really important that
people understand that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lobbying isn't necessarily the most
glorious thing in the world, but that's
[SPEAKER_07]: how you get shit done.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we need from everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need everyone to be able to pitch in
resources, time, connections, whatever you
[SPEAKER_07]: have.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not going to have a whole lot of
time to hang out after this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to leave town.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll give you my email right now,
nrcpak at gmail.com, nrcpak at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to meet with anyone and
everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want to endorse our campaign,
we're happy to throw your logo up.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd love to get a statement of support.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'd love to work with you on figuring
out how to activate your constituent base
[SPEAKER_07]: to help make cannabis consumption a
reality in Oregon in 2019.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Sam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Newrevenuecoalition.com, check it out,
nrcpak at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sam, just one quick question for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned in a dream world you'd like
to see cannabis and alcohol served at the
[SPEAKER_05]: same establishments.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will that same establishment be able to
have axe throwing as well?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who all went to the axe throwing last
night?
[SPEAKER_07]: Did anyone from the OCC go to the axe
throwing last night?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm just saying, if we can
legally drink beer and throw axes and just
[SPEAKER_07]: sign a waiver, the safer alternative is
smoking weed and throwing axes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's look into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Adam Smith, take us away on why we
need to export cannabis and how we're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: I may stand up standing up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm from New York, so I talk fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I only have a little bit of time and a
lot of stuff to go over.
[SPEAKER_06]: So try to stay with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Adam Smith.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the founder and executive director of
the Kraft Cannabis Alliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are a mission driven trade association
representing companies large and small
[SPEAKER_06]: that are majority Oregon owned,
that have made a commitment to
[SPEAKER_06]: sustainability, ethical business and
employment practices, positive community
[SPEAKER_06]: engagement, and ending the drug war.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not here to talk about the Kraft
Cannabis Alliance today.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's who we are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I get into export, I just want to
note something because I'm not sure who
[SPEAKER_06]: will say this from the stage today,
but the FBI numbers came out and Anthony
[SPEAKER_06]: referenced the fact that we've only
arrested 47 people last year in Oregon for
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But nationwide, those numbers actually
went up this past year.
[SPEAKER_06]: We arrested over 600,000 people across the
country.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're in the cannabis industry,
if you make your living from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: industry, okay, I know in Oregon we're not
making a ton of money from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: industry, but we have our fingers on this
pot of gold, on this bag of gold,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the only reason that's true is because
we're standing on a mountain of 80 years
[SPEAKER_06]: of ruined lives and destroyed communities
and we have a moral, ethical, cultural and
[SPEAKER_06]: financial obligation to make sure that we
are funding ending the drug war writ
[SPEAKER_06]: large, not just opening up a conference.
[SPEAKER_06]: So may I suggest, if you're looking for
ways to do that, may I suggest Students
[SPEAKER_06]: for Sensible Drug Policy, NORML,
the Drug Policy Alliance, Marijuana Policy
[SPEAKER_06]: Project, whether that's local or national,
think about being part of the solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: How we got here?
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people here do business in
Oregon?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people here would be in favor of
being able to export products out of
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon?
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent, we got a friendly crowd.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I'm gonna stand up.
[SPEAKER_06]: How did we, I'm not gonna stand up because
I leave the photo, all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how did we get here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon decided, and I think it was a smart
idea, we decided to legalize the industry
[SPEAKER_06]: we had here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually ran a campaign called Go Legal
and the campaign was not about bring your
[SPEAKER_06]: big multinational here, buy up a bunch of
farms and set up shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: The campaign was that we had an industry
here, have had an industry here for
[SPEAKER_06]: generations and we wanted to make it
feasible for all of those folks that had
[SPEAKER_06]: been participating to continue
participating on the legal side.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a good instinct.
[SPEAKER_06]: We legalized the industry we had.
[SPEAKER_06]: The states had come on in and thousands of
people did.
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is it turned out the industry
we had was largely an export industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so folks got, we had medical
obviously, right, but for generations we
[SPEAKER_06]: have been feeding, the West Coast has been
feeding the nation's cannabis desires and
[SPEAKER_06]: doing it well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we roped in all of this product.
[SPEAKER_06]: We said go ahead, everybody grow and we
turned around and with cheap and easy
[SPEAKER_06]: licensing and boom, we have a glut,
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Billy Williams, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: Attorney here calls it a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to call it a bounty, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a bounty, but if you think things
are bountiful now, wait till California
[SPEAKER_06]: gets their licensing on track,
it's gonna be very bountiful on the West
[SPEAKER_06]: Coast, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon is an export state and we have
always been an export state and that is
[SPEAKER_06]: how this will function going forward and
that's the future for Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we have right now is we have a
number of problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, we have the problem that we've
had since the beginning of Prohibition
[SPEAKER_06]: which is we are exporting like it or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second problem we have is that we have
producer counties that don't have
[SPEAKER_06]: resources enough resources coming in to
enforce regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the third problem is that we are on
the brink of an economic catastrophe in
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon, a real-time economic crisis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have hundreds of millions of dollars of
local capital that is on the verge of
[SPEAKER_06]: being wiped out, that stands to be wiped
out over the next 12 to 24 months,
[SPEAKER_06]: right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is not Nike's local capital or
Intel's local capital.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the local capital of thousands of
people who have gone all in to be part of
[SPEAKER_06]: this legal industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, and if this was any other industry,
if we had this kind of local capital and
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands of jobs at imminent risk,
we would have political leadership coming
[SPEAKER_06]: from everywhere screaming at the federal
government to open up markets for our
[SPEAKER_06]: hazelnuts or filberts, you know,
for our salmon, for our grass seed,
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's cannabis, so it's touchy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not touchy, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are looking at, we are in the midst of
a sea change nationally.
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of months ago, New York's
governor Andrew Cuomo came out and said,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, it's not a matter of if New York
should legalize cannabis, it's how New
[SPEAKER_06]: York should legalize cannabis,
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, right now under the current system,
the way things are, if New York wants to
[SPEAKER_06]: legalize cannabis tomorrow, they would
have to create from scratch a production
[SPEAKER_06]: industry approximately four to five times
larger than Oregon's production industry,
[SPEAKER_06]: right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's neither competitive nor
economically feasible, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can grow oranges in New York
too if you want, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a good business plan,
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so not saying that folks in New York
shouldn't grow, but they should grow if
[SPEAKER_06]: they believe they can be competitive with
West Coast cannabis coming, because West
[SPEAKER_06]: Coast cannabis is going to come.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it may take until, you know,
it may take until federal prohibition
[SPEAKER_06]: ends, but that day is coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we need to look economically toward
what is the future of this industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to fix all of those problems,
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me just go back.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: Attorney Billy Williams said this is out
of control, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's diversion from the legal market.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is illicit growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is organized crime.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, and to some extent that is
not untrue, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it has been such since the beginning
of prohibition, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Prohibition didn't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't work now.
[SPEAKER_06]: The state is not going to suddenly become
able to make prohibition work,
[SPEAKER_06]: right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question is not should Oregon
export or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: The question is how is Oregon going to
export?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going to export ad hoc, illegally,
unregulated in ways that make everybody,
[SPEAKER_06]: including the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: Attorney, unhappy?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or are we going to do this in a way that
is regulated going into states that want
[SPEAKER_06]: it into licensed hands to go to adults
where we get revenues back?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the only question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have decided that it is time to push
that question.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have started a campaign called One
Fixed Cannabis, where one stands for
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon Needs Export, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there is a, and let me tell you right
up front, our goal is to export product
[SPEAKER_06]: legally from Oregon by the end of 2020.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are, we plan to send product out of
Oregon by the end of 2020.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if it takes four years to get to
export or five years, then there is a
[SPEAKER_06]: really good chance that 80 or 90% of the
local industry here will be no more,
[SPEAKER_06]: right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have large companies that have come in
here and they have every right to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are buying up farms and buying up
retail and buying up brands, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're not here because they think
they're going to get rich selling cash.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to sell cannabis to
Oregonians, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's not too much hyperbole to
say it's possible that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the last profitable dollar has already
been made selling cannabis to Oregonians,
[SPEAKER_06]: right.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are here because there is an Oregon
brand of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when those walls come down,
we are going to have a multi-billion
[SPEAKER_06]: dollar export industry, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's a really good chance that if
it takes too long, there's going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: some small number of large, deep-pocketed
companies that have outlasted and bought
[SPEAKER_06]: out everybody else who will own the Oregon
brand globally.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we will turn around and have this
multi-billion dollar industry and we will
[SPEAKER_06]: say, wow, what a shame.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't really have a significant
ownership stake here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I have good friends that work for
some of these large companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we took a snapshot of the Oregon
industry right now and that's how this
[SPEAKER_06]: went forward with the mix that we have of
outside companies and inside companies,
[SPEAKER_06]: we would have a healthy ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we are not trending in that direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the longer it takes us to open up new
markets, the harder and harder it's going
[SPEAKER_06]: to get for us to have an industry that is
of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And make no mistake, the reason that the
Oregon has a brand globally for our
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis is exactly because of that
artisan craft, right, industry that has
[SPEAKER_06]: worked for generations to create the best
cannabis on the planet, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it is valuable to everyone for that
to survive.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to close this up.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: The One Fixed Cannabis Campaign,
it's a three-step process.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first thing we absolutely have to do
is we have to pass a bill, and Senator
[SPEAKER_06]: Presansky, I believe, is going to help us
do that, that is going to allow us,
[SPEAKER_06]: that is going to make it legal under state
law to approve transfers for the
[SPEAKER_06]: governor's office to approve transfers out
of state.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, if cannabis became legal
tomorrow federally, it would still be
[SPEAKER_06]: illegal under Oregon law for us to approve
out-of-state transfers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get that out of the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't get product out of the state,
but it gets the legislature out of the way
[SPEAKER_06]: so that when the time comes, we are able
to jump on that opportunity, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing we need to understand
is that we don't, the situation at the
[SPEAKER_06]: federal level is fluid, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not about waiting for the federal
government to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have never made an advance in cannabis
policy in the last 40 years because the
[SPEAKER_06]: federal government decided to make
something legal and said, here,
[SPEAKER_06]: go ahead, do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Never.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not once.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have not legalized medical yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would still be waiting.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't wait, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we need to do is get, make it
legal in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to pass this bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is vital.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a necessary first step.
[SPEAKER_06]: That campaign to pass the bill is also a
platform to tell this story nationally
[SPEAKER_06]: about the future of the economics in
cannabis and find our partners around the
[SPEAKER_06]: state that are going to lobby for their
state to allow import, whether that's New
[SPEAKER_06]: York or New Jersey or Nevada or Utah's
medical program or Oklahoma's medical
[SPEAKER_06]: program.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to punch a hole in the wall.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to make a transfer from Oregon's
system into another state's legal system
[SPEAKER_06]: that the states approve and the federal
government lets happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once that happens, we are in an entirely
different world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we need to bring it right up to the
line and look at the federal government
[SPEAKER_06]: and force them to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to enforce against two state
governors that have decided they're ready
[SPEAKER_06]: to move cannabis and that this is going to
help clear up the illicit market?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we need to get.
OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I want to thank, by the way,
you're going to hear from Casey Huland
[SPEAKER_06]: from ORCA.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are our partners in One Fix Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are doing an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just met with Sungrower's Guild down
south.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are going to join the campaign.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if Pete is here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a terrific meeting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really excited to work with those
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a sign-on letter.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we go to the legislature and we ask
for things like social use, the first
[SPEAKER_06]: thing people are going to ask is,
where is the industry on this?
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get 1,000 license holders on
this sign-on letter.
[SPEAKER_06]: You go to onefixcannabis.org.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes you 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sign on to the letter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to be able to show that this is
something everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we are going to lobby when the
legislative session starts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are going to get this done.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to pass this on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But please be part of both of these
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to bring people into the state to
show them the incredible world class level
[SPEAKER_06]: of our cannabis and let them go home and
spread our fame and our brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we need to be able to send it to
them and get it on their shelves,
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it's in a state that's already
legal or the next state that becomes
[SPEAKER_06]: legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do this by 2020.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, it's up to the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up to the industry to stand up
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope you will.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Adam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Onefixcannabis.org.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's make it happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Casey, you're up, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Anthony.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Casey Houlihan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the executive director of the Oregon
Retailers of Cannabis Association.
[SPEAKER_03]: We represent over 350 cannabis businesses
in the industry across the state,
[SPEAKER_03]: many of whom are retailers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also have producers, processors,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Several of whom I believe are here today.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're not a member, talk to us
after.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be here all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to echo a lot of what you just
heard from both of these speakers.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot that we're working on for
the upcoming legislative session in 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be a unique session in a
couple of ways that I wanted to point out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be the first long session that
we've had in the legislature for some time
[SPEAKER_03]: without a specific committee dedicated to
focusing on cannabis related policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That does mean that we are going to be
competing with traditional industries and
[SPEAKER_03]: other interest groups at the Capitol for
basic bandwidth, for room on committee
[SPEAKER_03]: hearings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to make sure that we can get
their time and attention for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of what we're seeing is the
culmination of efforts from a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: folks up here that they've been doing for
years at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's exactly the type of time frame
that we're typically looking at for
[SPEAKER_03]: getting these substantive policy measures
passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's years after years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of the other reasons I'm very
excited about this upcoming session is
[SPEAKER_03]: that we've also made more progress than
ever before.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have more advocates and allies on our
side than ever before.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've added more legislators to the
positive columns for all three or all two
[SPEAKER_03]: of these legislation bills that these guys
are talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as the others that I'm going to
mention here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our number one focus, as Adam pointed out,
is also going to be making sure that we
[SPEAKER_03]: can get a reasonable export policy for
this state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as you all know, we are wildly
saturated on the production side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the biggest solution that we could
possibly have would be to get that to
[SPEAKER_03]: another state that needs it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get more money into the pockets of
the growers here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, I think at the Capitol,
we're probably going to start referring to
[SPEAKER_03]: that bill as the Oregon Cannabis Industry
Full Employment Act of 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's nothing else we could do
to help the jobs outlook in this state,
[SPEAKER_03]: in this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: To Sam's point as well, and this is
actually one of the other elements that's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be new, we have more forces and
more groups that are coalesced around a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of these specific issues and driving
support for these specific issues than
[SPEAKER_03]: we've seen historically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a really effective mechanism at
adding support.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's another area where, especially
when we're talking about something very
[SPEAKER_03]: controversial like social consumption,
where clearly there have been some
[SPEAKER_03]: stakeholders, particularly the public
health advocates, who have been very
[SPEAKER_03]: obstinate in their opposition to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is another area where, after years of
making small progress and getting more
[SPEAKER_03]: allies on our side, that I think this is
going to be the best chance we've had yet
[SPEAKER_03]: to get this type of bill through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really important that we all get
behind it and make sure that we can show
[SPEAKER_03]: our support for those lobbying efforts as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of the other things that I know
that we've discussed in past sessions that
[SPEAKER_03]: our association is looking to bring back
up as well is actually a bill that was
[SPEAKER_03]: introduced by Senator Przezanski in 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe SB 301 at the time, which would
have eliminated employment discrimination
[SPEAKER_03]: for off-hour cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is an important one because
there's still a great deal of folks out
[SPEAKER_03]: there who are concerned about losing their
job or employment or financial security if
[SPEAKER_03]: they consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is another example, as Sam pointed
out, of privileged legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we think that this is something that
everybody should be able to have access
[SPEAKER_03]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody should be punished or deprived of
an economic opportunity because they
[SPEAKER_03]: choose a safer legal intoxicant in the
state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is an area where consumers can
really directly provide a lot of input and
[SPEAKER_03]: carry quite a bit of the weight of these
measures we're trying to advocate for in
[SPEAKER_03]: session.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam had appropriately pointed out that a
grassroots effort on this can be extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: impactful to legislators, and especially
on an area like this where so many
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers directly would be impacted by
this type of policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one where we, especially as
retailers, can reach out to our consumers
[SPEAKER_03]: to make sure they understand to advocate
for their interests and to talk to their
[SPEAKER_03]: state representatives and their state
senators to make sure that they support
[SPEAKER_03]: these bills as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lastly, I also wanted to talk about
another bill that we're working on to
[SPEAKER_03]: vacate automatically past cannabis
convictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: For folks that had been victimized by the
prohibition on cannabis in the war on
[SPEAKER_03]: drugs historically.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a path right now for getting
those types of charges expunged.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it is fairly circuitous,
it's fairly time-consuming, and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: relatively costly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as such, many folks have not taken
advantage of it that could.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something that we would like to
have done at the state level in statute so
[SPEAKER_03]: that it can happen automatically for those
past offenses and folks don't have to jump
[SPEAKER_03]: through a series of hoops to have
something stricken from the record that
[SPEAKER_03]: shouldn't have been there in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also, I wear two hats in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also work with BDS Analytics,
which is a market researcher.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a data firm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do operate kind of at the
cross-section of policy and data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a couple things I wanted to
mention just in terms of consumer power
[SPEAKER_03]: from the cannabis consumer perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many lobbying groups right
now that happen nationally, that work
[SPEAKER_03]: nationally, that are essentially consumer
organizations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think of the NRA as one of the most
powerful typically that folks think of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because gun sales are massive.
[SPEAKER_03]: 30% of Americans currently report that
they own a firearm and estimated right now
[SPEAKER_03]: between $9 and $10 billion in North
American gun sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, in states that have legalization
policy, consumer insight research that we
[SPEAKER_03]: have done has shown that 32% of folks in
those legal states have consumed cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: in the last six months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 2017, legal cannabis sales were
$9.7 billion in North America.
[SPEAKER_03]: In about four years, they're anticipated
to go up to $24 billion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're gonna be running circles around
some of the biggest interest groups in the
[SPEAKER_03]: country in terms of how many sales they're
bringing in relative to ours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is an area where you can vote
with your voice, you can vote with your
[SPEAKER_03]: dollar, you can connect with your
representative.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are a seasoned constituency that at
this point needs to have our voice heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to finish the job of
legalization that we started four years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Casey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Casey, how can people find you online?
[SPEAKER_05]: Casey, how can people find you online to
get involved?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at Oregoncannabisretailers.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have a table right out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can chat with us all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's hear from our ally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what, from your perspective,
Senator Prizanski, from inside the
[SPEAKER_05]: legislative building.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important to kind of take
a step back to look at where we were and
[SPEAKER_01]: where we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Adam brought up a very distinct
point of the diversion that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in 2015, after the Measure 91 was
passed in 14, that's when we had a super
[SPEAKER_01]: committee that opened up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 10 members, five senators,
and five representatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of the vice chairs of the
committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: During that process, it came very clear
that we needed to do certain things to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that we weren't going to have this
glut of product on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had testimony that told us that we
already had within the medical program
[SPEAKER_01]: that had been in existence since 98 when
it was passed and started growing in 99,
[SPEAKER_01]: so about 14 years, three to five times as
much product, flour, already being grown
[SPEAKER_01]: in the state without even going into the
recreational system, and that was based on
[SPEAKER_01]: research that an individual at OSU had
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we took from that and what I took
from that was that we needed to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: bill that was going to limit new
production for growers to limit new people
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in out of state, so basically a
residency requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a bill that actually was going to
require a four-year residency program,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we could in fact allow for the mom and
pops throughout this state that were the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots of this program of what we're now
benefiting from to be able to transition
[SPEAKER_01]: into the open market.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're going to also do is not keep
someone from coming into the state,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're going to get what would be
called a vertical license, a license that
[SPEAKER_01]: would allow them to grow for their own
need and use, but they would not be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to flood the market with their flour or
their extracts or any other processing
[SPEAKER_01]: into the open market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd have to sell it through their own
retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would self-regulate them as to how
much they grew because they could only
[SPEAKER_01]: sell it within their own retail outlet or
through their own processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that that would limit the
addition, and it would allow for everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: else who are Oregonians before we had this
transition coming in to actually have a
[SPEAKER_01]: place at the table, have an existing
market, and actually be able to come in
[SPEAKER_01]: from being on the outs and being in a
regulated industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what we have seen since then is this
glut.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what we're dealing with,
and so in 2017, I did in fact introduce a
[SPEAKER_01]: Senate Bill 1042.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested in looking at it,
you can go to the Oregon legislative
[SPEAKER_01]: website, and you go to the bills,
go to the sessions first, pick the 2017
[SPEAKER_01]: session, and then look up SB 1042.
[SPEAKER_01]: What 1042 called for was to establish a
process for the governor to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: enter into compacts with adjacent states
that had marijuana programs, either
[SPEAKER_01]: medical and or recreational programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in Oregon, we now have adjacent
states of California, Nevada, and
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would in fact allow for those who are
in the process of growing that want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to get a return for their product to
actually be able to have it go across
[SPEAKER_01]: state lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what we've realized is that through
this drafting, we needed to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism that would keep it from being
exclusively regulated by the feds,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is through ground transportation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my belief from working with our
legislative council that we could in fact
[SPEAKER_01]: do that because only air and marine,
meaning water, transportation is
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusively regulated by the feds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, even though I got the
bill passed out of my Senate Judiciary
[SPEAKER_01]: Committee, it went to another committee,
and the leadership chose not to move the
[SPEAKER_01]: bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bill will be reintroduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be looking at potential
modifications, and Adam says one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that we want to be as an exporting
state, this is my vision as well because
[SPEAKER_01]: we have seen it, we know it will be there,
and the reality, there's little that any
[SPEAKER_01]: other state's going to be able to do to
outdo our state and our growers because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're so renowned as to what they do do
and the success that they have had in the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical application.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why would a state that has no medical
growing program want to try to establish
[SPEAKER_01]: that program?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now clearly they can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If New York wants to do that, so be it,
but guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that we have a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that we have growers who have been
able to identify attributes of their
[SPEAKER_01]: strains to help individuals and medical
needs, and as I heard from veterans in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of my committee, the bottom line is
they want to be able to function.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be part of society.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be able to take care of their
families.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't do it on opiates, but they can
do it if they have access to quality
[SPEAKER_01]: strains of marijuana that actually work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will benefit them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the things we want to do,
and this is now taken off to another step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just this week I had individuals coming in
from California who represents the rural
[SPEAKER_01]: counties who are looking at 1042 as how
they can actually start working on their
[SPEAKER_01]: side of the state boundary to actually
implement that so we can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may see the first two states
actually doing this between us and
[SPEAKER_01]: California, but I still want to have that
opening for everywhere else, meaning
[SPEAKER_01]: adjacent states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everywhere else I'm afraid is going to
take a piece of legislation on the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very doable because we have
29 plus states in D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: that are doing medical programs,
so I think the first step that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to see on the federal side will be a
laxing allowing for transfer of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana between states that allow for
medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will allow us to go interstate
commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will in fact allow us to ship by air
or by water to other states that are not
[SPEAKER_01]: adjacent to us, and that's a key component
that we need to actually expand this out
[SPEAKER_01]: as Adam would like to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I think that we need to do
for diversion and dealing with this is
[SPEAKER_01]: taking off the 20 pound limit for medical
transfers into the recreational system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have a problem, and we've heard from
Billy Williams, we've heard from others
[SPEAKER_01]: that it is the outdoor growing in southern
Oregon, the place, the birth spot for
[SPEAKER_01]: medical production, why don't we allow
them to get their product, whatever excess
[SPEAKER_01]: they have, after they take care of their
patients, into the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if you want to deal with diversion,
this is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last thing I want to bring up to
you is I think is something that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard from some of the discussions this
morning and why it's so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to ensure that we maintain the
continuity that we have today with the
[SPEAKER_01]: growers from yesterday that are here now
in multiple generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot let them fall off the wayside
because they don't have the capital to
[SPEAKER_01]: compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for ways that we can do that,
and I think there's a couple things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to be stressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, we need to have research on
the attributes of medical applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have put in place a research component,
and we do have the commission that's
[SPEAKER_01]: working on this, but I do think it's
something that we need to keep in mind we
[SPEAKER_01]: can't lose track of.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of those areas that I think
that we can have another license under
[SPEAKER_01]: OLCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked to them briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't warmed up to it completely,
but we can have a license that allows for
[SPEAKER_01]: a rider for medical growers to actually be
able to file with the agency or a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be Oregon Health Authority.
[SPEAKER_01]: The attributes of their strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not backed by scientific
research, but until the feds open that
[SPEAKER_01]: door, we can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we can do is we can continue to
establish what the different strains that
[SPEAKER_01]: are being grown here, what they've been
beneficial for, and then we'll have that
[SPEAKER_01]: in our back pocket when we start seeing
national research going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be already demarking that market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the last thing that we need to do
in this area is see genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of those areas that if you
think about, for those who are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room, think about the graduate movie when
William Brooks said to Dustin Hoffman,
[SPEAKER_01]: just one word, plastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if that word would have been
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if that word would have been in the
application of how you actually make your
[SPEAKER_01]: product available and stronger for
whatever the needs of the market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our seed genetics is where we have as a
state, because of all the work that has
[SPEAKER_01]: been done in historical perspective,
if we can maintain that, we will be an
[SPEAKER_01]: exporting state of not only product,
but seeds to other parts of the world
[SPEAKER_01]: because everyone knows what the brand we
have here is what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to actually duplicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did want to make an announcement because
I have been told that we have got the AC
[SPEAKER_05]: blasting, so we're cooling it off in here
because it got a little hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've got time for one,
maybe two questions for Engayo,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you can flag them down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe not a question for me, but a
question for the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that Germany, or rather Canada,
is exporting medical cannabis to Germany
[SPEAKER_04]: and other countries right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Oregon or some of these West
Coast states could get involved in
[SPEAKER_04]: international cannabis exporting as well,
or are you trying to keep it just on a
[SPEAKER_04]: national level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd love to have us right there
competing with Canada on the international
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could beat Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our weed is way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt that we can, but there
are sisters, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, as the Cascadia region,
we want to be all inclusive, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: reality is we are not going to be able to
do that until we have movement on the
[SPEAKER_01]: federal side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until they actually, and this is part of
the interstate commerce, and when we talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about interstate commerce, we actually are
talking not only interstate within the US,
[SPEAKER_01]: but internationally, because once that
happens, the doors open as Canada and
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany has already shown us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a quick, it's like a group of
questions, but I know they don't have time
[SPEAKER_02]: for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the main part about it is,
as a small recreational grower that's gone
[SPEAKER_02]: through all the hoops and spent all the
money, and we're the ones being hit the
[SPEAKER_02]: hardest in this industry, do you guys,
are you looking at the implications of
[SPEAKER_02]: allowing us to be cross-bordering with
California, which has so much money and so
[SPEAKER_02]: much size and so much different
regulations?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just see that that's gonna destroy the
small growers, including also discussion
[SPEAKER_02]: on genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics should be open.
[SPEAKER_02]: If genetics are protected, Monsanto-type
companies are gonna come in and take over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that, I mean, all you guys up
there, are you guys thinking about the
[SPEAKER_02]: small, independent growers who are in
Oregon suffering right now with an
[SPEAKER_02]: overabundance even the 20 pound increase,
you're talking about allowing more product
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not been regulated into our very
tightly overpopulated marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to address a piece of that,
in terms of opening borders, obviously we
[SPEAKER_06]: can export your opening borders for
product to come in, but at this moment,
[SPEAKER_06]: it would not be a really good business
decision for almost anyone to send
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis into Oregon, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can smuggle cocaine into
Bolivia, if you want, but it loses a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of its value when it gets there,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's the same, we're in that,
by the time we get to a point where
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody wants to send cannabis in here
for commercial reasons, it'll mean that
[SPEAKER_06]: we've stabilized our prices, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we need to get there first before
we worry about California.
[SPEAKER_06]: California and Oregon are both obviously
gonna be export states.
[SPEAKER_06]: To the extent that we can work with each
other to break a hole in that wall,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I met with the same folks from
California that Senator Presansky met
[SPEAKER_06]: with, the rural counties, and they're
really interested in this, if we can work
[SPEAKER_06]: together to do that, then we can set a
precedent and we can all get it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me also follow up for the small
recreational growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a product, I assume, that you are
very proud of and the strains that you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The people on the other side of their
borders want that product because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: been regulated, it's been tested,
and you've got quality product as compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to someone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I think the small businesses
will in fact be able to compete here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think it's the lifeline as
compared to having this market flood by
[SPEAKER_01]: ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, on the genetics, to me, the part
that's very important, you're correct,
[SPEAKER_01]: it needs to be open.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we don't want to see is the mass
pharma or whoever else come in here and
[SPEAKER_01]: take control.
[SPEAKER_01]: How else are we gonna do that if we don't
have our own research happening here and
[SPEAKER_01]: ensuring that we have that viability for
our small businesses?
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, once we have that research,
I'll just name out one person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seth Crawford, who gave us a lot of
testimony back in 2015 and 2016,
[SPEAKER_01]: he and his brother have been working on
genetics outside on their farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of Corvallis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're into stuff that, well,
it's above my head, let's just say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just amazing what they're looking
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we know, how many canards are in
marijuana that have not been researched,
[SPEAKER_01]: have not been identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems important to me that we have
that type of research being done,
[SPEAKER_01]: sanctioned within the state, so we can
have our state to be a medical research as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as just a seed generating research
facility that people come to Oregon to
[SPEAKER_01]: find out what's best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it again for Anthony,
the entire panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in depth.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of wild.
