[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to our panel about cannabis
extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Michael Knod.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a freelance journalist and author of
the so far only book in German language
[SPEAKER_02]: about cannabis extraction, which is this
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I felt competent to moderate this
panel and have a lot of very competent
[SPEAKER_02]: guests from the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to start, I have to look at my
notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to start with the president of the
Dezimal engineered systems, which is an
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon based market leader in commercial
extraction system for cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jonah Barber, welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jonah, could you tell us about the
background of your company?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your everyday's business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we actually started back in 2012
from an analytical cannabis testing
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: We helped set the standards for testing
hemp and cannabis in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we actually started making CO2
equipment based off of test results just
[SPEAKER_00]: to have more consistency and
repeatability, implementing automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we continued to evolve with
ethanol, hydrocarbon, distillation,
[SPEAKER_00]: isolation with a focus on automation for
more repeatability, less manpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now a focus, of course,
on compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next to Jonah, we have Nick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick Prousianos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I pronounce that the right way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You founded Cannabris in 2019,
which is for a medical distributor for
[SPEAKER_02]: leading manufacturer and services for
specializing on the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your daily business when it
comes to extraction or how are you
[SPEAKER_02]: connected with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: We represent a very reputable manufacturer
for extraction, for CO2 extraction from
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we like to propose this as the main
proposal from our company combined with a
[SPEAKER_03]: closed system for winterization and
de-waxing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, of course, we can offer
other extraction methods like ethanol,
[SPEAKER_03]: like water extraction, or even vapor
static, which is a new thing for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But our main proposal is the CO2
extraction with a closed system for
[SPEAKER_03]: winterization and de-waxing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your company Cannabris is based in
Greece as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's based in Athens, Greece.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, we have a local medical
cannabis framework and some investments
[SPEAKER_03]: happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Greece, you need to do everything
from cultivation, processing, packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you need to have a facility that does
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was one of the motivations for us
to offer all the solutions for the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation, to extraction, to packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to help our local projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this, of course, allowed us to enter
other markets like Israel, North
[SPEAKER_03]: Macedonia, that were more mature markets
than the Greek market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, afterwards, we expanded to
Malta, Switzerland, and hopefully we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get towards the West a bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Macedonian market is already a
player in the game?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: The company that we represent has already
five or six CO2 extraction systems working
[SPEAKER_03]: and installed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an active market and it's been
growing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know, there are some
facilities that are more successful than
[SPEAKER_03]: others, but it's considered a mature
market for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's close to our neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can drive there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a big market, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Nick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come back to that later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next to Nick, we have Dr. George Stunchef.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I pronounce that the right way?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are an entrepreneur and CEO of a very
innovative cannabis extraction company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me more about the background of your
company, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're a European company, out of
Bulgaria, 25 years experience in botanical
[SPEAKER_04]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got into the cannabis industry by
accident, literally 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have a U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: office of extraction and sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're most famous as Pure 5 Extraction,
Pure Team 5 Census.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're known for building systems based on
a 134A aerosol, which is extremely
[SPEAKER_04]: selective.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's solvent and extracts high terpene
profile with full carbonyl profile,
[SPEAKER_04]: about 85% potency, no need for
mineralization, no need for any
[SPEAKER_04]: post-processing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's literally our biggest advantage
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being there, we've seen a lot into the
cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even we make some other systems like
ethanol, hexane.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're really focused on what gives the
best value to the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your company is based in?
[SPEAKER_04]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: company is based in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have offices in Colorado, Pennsylvania,
Oregon, and California, where we extract
[SPEAKER_04]: also cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: The factories are in Bulgaria,
so we build everything in the European
[SPEAKER_04]: Union.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: To my left, we have Dr. Joe Thompson,
who already put up a lot of or enabled a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of companies to be a part of the
instruction, of the instruction branch in
[SPEAKER_02]: the U.S.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please tell me more about your company in
the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we spent, basically we got
started in 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 132 installations total.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not specifically only extraction,
but we do extraction distillation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of chromatography,
preparative chromatography.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a materials company, so we do
selective materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our primary focus these days is just
servicing clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing phase one, phase two clinical
trial support, CMO type work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been really a good direction,
I think, for the industry in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that extraction systems alone are
really not adequate for the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have, you need to be able to
refine those.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be able to purify them in full
contained systems, fully automated
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our whole entire approach is a holistic
approach that really is fully contained
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, basically from extraction all the
way through to isolate, from extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way through to chromatography,
100% contained.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody touches it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes right through fully CIP system
enabled so that you can clean it out with
[SPEAKER_01]: just the push of the button.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are what we're really working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been making those for
pharmaceutical companies primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't serviced the recreational
market in several years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to Germany, I maybe have to
explain that we are not on the level like
[SPEAKER_02]: in the US or in Canada when it comes to
extraction, because our medical law does
[SPEAKER_02]: not allow the same extractions or the same
extraction product for patient as the US
[SPEAKER_02]: or the Canadian law allows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our extractions here in Germany so far
are limited to 25% in the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why German companies are not so
experienced in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we choose a lot of experts from
overseas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And please let me ask Jonah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of different ways to
extract cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is the most popular way to extract
cannabis for a company in Oregon or in the
[SPEAKER_02]: US?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to extraction,
there's no one perfect extraction method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important to
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone that's just trying to sell you a
specific piece of equipment without
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding what your specific needs and
goals are is not going to be set up for
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the way we approach it,
we actually engage with the customer and
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially reverse engineer what their
goals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk to them about what kind of
products you want to make, what's your
[SPEAKER_00]: throughput you're looking for,
what's your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of accreditations do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we actually reverse engineer the
whole thing, essentially turnkey,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you need like C1D1 rooms and all
the equipment, all the way from the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning extraction all the way to,
again, distillation or isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say right now in Oregon, probably the
most popular is BHL now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially it was CO2 because CO2 was
generally recognized as probably the most
[SPEAKER_00]: safest extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jurisdictional and municipalities also
felt most comfortable with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also from a customer base,
just people thinking it was the solvent
[SPEAKER_00]: with CO2 just made them feel more
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that the market's been more educated
and understand that hydrocarbon really
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't dangerous if done properly,
that's become more popular just because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the versatility as far as being able to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do dry, fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can also make shatters and also
vape pins and also distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really covers a lot of the basics
even from a cost standpoint as well too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if customers are gonna,
then we have hemp customers though that
[SPEAKER_00]: would like to make, do 10,000 pounds a day
and wanna make all distillate and isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for something like that, then we're
gonna go like a large ethanol system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really just project specific is
how we look at it and we really try to
[SPEAKER_00]: partner with our customers to understand
their needs and tailor something
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Jonah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick, as a European extractor,
would you agree why do you think we do in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe, we mostly do CO2 extraction,
sometimes you do ethanol, but PHO or even
[SPEAKER_03]: PHO is not attractive here at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that so?
[SPEAKER_03]: From what we've seen so far, most of the
requests and most of the investments
[SPEAKER_03]: happening at this moment are with the CO2
extraction method.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course we get requests and there are
investments with the ethanol as a method.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's well established as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the smaller number.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we start to see some requests for
water extraction, which I think is also
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a little bit of vapor static,
but mainly the request we receive is for
[SPEAKER_03]: CO2 extraction, much less ethanol.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's say water extraction is start to
picking up and be part of the discussion,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is quite an established method for
the recreational market in the US and
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we understand the reasons why they
want to approach it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could be a cheap solution,
not a high investment, and it's quick and
[SPEAKER_03]: it uses water.
[SPEAKER_02]: May that be maybe because the turps in the
German or in the European medical market,
[SPEAKER_02]: the terpenes, do not play a major role.
[SPEAKER_02]: George, would you agree if I say that may
be a case because if terpenes do not play
[SPEAKER_02]: a major role, the method of extraction is
not so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is the experience in the US?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you working at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one of the things that is important,
obviously, is the stability of the
[SPEAKER_01]: extract, especially in a GMP setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have terpenes in the GMP
extract, that is not a stable extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from the standpoint of GMP,
it's really not allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we know from the FDA trials with
Sativax, for example, which failed,
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily because of those terpenes that
were in there and the background and the
[SPEAKER_01]: unknowns that were being generated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you think about a clinical,
like a pharma type of clinical mindset,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're typically looking to get an extract
that's as clean as possible, that's as
[SPEAKER_01]: stable as possible, that's shelf stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's important to have
multiple different means to purify your
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only to the extracts, we can all talk
about different ways to extract,
[SPEAKER_01]: but ultimately, it has to be purified,
it has to be formulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, 25% only is allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a formulated extract, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look to Colorado, George,
for example, which role do terpenes play?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they play a major role or do
cannabinoids play the major role when it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to extraction?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rush effect is very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually terpenes are a multiplier.
[SPEAKER_04]: With right terpenes in there, you really
can turn them out like one plus one makes
[SPEAKER_04]: four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they really make that extract more
bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the terpenes, they manipulate the
cannabinoids into the proper way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been talking to a lot of patients
from Oregon and Colorado, the first
[SPEAKER_04]: states, when they came legal, and they
recognized that this train can help them
[SPEAKER_04]: for this, this train can help them for
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the difference in between strains is
really the terp profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are about 30,000 terps in nature,
and there are about 300 terps known in
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And combination between them, they amplify
the effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: They affect a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So terps, they play a major role,
and there's a lot to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like looking at U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: market, we've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how that market evolved, starting from
crude, from like Simpson going through
[SPEAKER_04]: distillates, going through enhanced
botanical extraction, like botanical
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes, that's all about experience and
adding the right terps mostly for
[SPEAKER_04]: experience, not so much for money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we come to the next question,
which goes out to all panelists in that
[SPEAKER_02]: case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a conflict between the patient's
demand and the regulatory when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: FDA or the German Cannabis Agency when it
comes to clinical studies on the long
[SPEAKER_02]: term?
[SPEAKER_02]: The one side says, we don't need to,
we cannot have the terpenes, or we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want them because they don't stable as the
product, then we have an unstable product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other side, we have the
patient's demand for terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we solve that on the long range,
Jonah?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it's important to
consider the difference, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: between recreational and medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's medical like here in
Germany, typically what we're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: is the government's going to be overly
cautious when they're first introducing a
[SPEAKER_00]: new product or a new market, and they want
to be able to have predictive results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even when it comes to diluting and
things like that, that way they can
[SPEAKER_00]: identify a repeatable experience with the
patient from that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the only way to be able to
handle that would be, again, where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fractionize, you know,
you can either fractionize different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, get exact percentages,
and then even with terpenes now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it would have to be,
again, a very repeatable controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: process for it to actually be acceptable
here, you know, medically from that site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the key issues here is,
you know, the FDAs and not only the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory bodies, they want to be able to
show that the placebo effect is real
[SPEAKER_01]: versus a placebo, which is nearly
impossible to do because you're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about multiple hundreds of different
compounds within the formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a clinical perspective or medical
perspective, pharmaceutical perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: those types of things really have a real
big of a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm going to spend 50 to say $50
million to get a drug through,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to start with a product that
has something in it that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: degrade because it's too costly when the
FDA says at the end of it that that's no
[SPEAKER_01]: good because it's degrading.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the claims themselves,
what would be the end point would be the
[SPEAKER_01]: key question in a clinical study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be like, OK, OK,
so this particular terpene has a 10x
[SPEAKER_01]: effect with a ratio of, say, THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, then you have to prove that
versus placebo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that from a medical and pharmaceutical
perspective, that's really the key barrier
[SPEAKER_01]: because even the real world data is very
convoluted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not very easy to come up with a real
world data that says, hey, this is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the great things about the
recreational market is that you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical real world data from that for
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If those companies actually design their
studies to get that data, they could
[SPEAKER_01]: really do a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: With their clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick, let me ask a little bit provocative
provoked to provoke you a little.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, what do you think it would be better
to have two kinds of extracts,
[SPEAKER_02]: one without anything pure cannabinoids
just for the medical side and another one
[SPEAKER_02]: for the recreational side containing all
the terpenes and other ingredients which
[SPEAKER_03]: are not in the medical What do you mean
exactly like to have two different
[SPEAKER_02]: products, one to have the medical product
terpene free.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a stable product and to have the
recreational product like full of
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, like full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to leave it out of the medical
product, not to have conflicts,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak, with the regulatory side.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can discuss about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a matter of regulation, as we all
discussed before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they allow this to happen and we can
have these products in the recreational or
[SPEAKER_03]: adult market within Europe, it will be a
good scenario for the market and for the
[SPEAKER_03]: patients or users of these products.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we're talking about medical products,
as we all discussed, you need to be very
[SPEAKER_03]: specific and to have specific formulation,
repeatable and tested and proven and to
[SPEAKER_03]: have the reasons of why this formulation
is there for what application.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, of course, I would like to see
these products to be available in the
[SPEAKER_03]: European market in any way possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be a solution for the US market
to have free extracts for patients?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, everybody knows what indica is,
sativa is and hybrid is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all these turps.
[SPEAKER_04]: The turps make a cannabis oil,
indica, sativa or hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that in marijuana, usually 95% is
the THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are minor cannabinoids, but there
are less than 10, less than 5%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everything else that defines the
medicinal values of the extract or how it
[SPEAKER_04]: works to the human being is based on the
turpin profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say maybe for certain patients
that they have a cancer conditions,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, use the distillate or something
combined with direct cannabinoids in a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain recipe, literally a recipe like
CBD to THC one in one with 5% CBG is a
[SPEAKER_04]: proven recipe for cancer from some medical
institutions and the reports based on
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the general consumer, they're
gonna be looking for the properties under
[SPEAKER_04]: the original strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the issues there is just simply
once it becomes a drug like CBD became a
[SPEAKER_01]: drug in the United States, all of the
formulations essentially by the regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: agencies became adulterated products and
that's why they've been, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been on the market, they're
basically not allowed to advertise,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not allowed to have banking,
they're not allowed to have all these
[SPEAKER_01]: things that a normal company would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing is going to happen with THC
in the United States and I think that that
[SPEAKER_01]: will have a global impact also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be really great if there was
such a thing as like a recreational taste
[SPEAKER_01]: version which there has to be,
there's going to be, no matter what we do
[SPEAKER_01]: from a clinical standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that the FDA is gonna try to
squash, at least in the US, the
[SPEAKER_01]: competition, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the role of the FDA in general,
I have to ask Jonah, what's the role of
[SPEAKER_02]: the FDA in general because as a German,
I think it's federally illegal so the FDA
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't have to do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not like this, is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean essentially the role of the
FDA is to ensure safety for consumers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where it can be frustrating of course
is they've been talking about having CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: be essentially approved by the FDA for,
people thought it'd be three, four,
[SPEAKER_00]: five years ago and it still hasn't
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, from a pharmaceutical side,
you're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what people were talking about as
far as being able to put it in food
[SPEAKER_00]: products and beverages and things like
that, I think a lot of people in the US
[SPEAKER_00]: expected it to have happened by now and it
hasn't which caused a lot of companies to
[SPEAKER_00]: then go out of business from that side
because they're expecting for that to have
[SPEAKER_00]: happened by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until the government's actually put the
right budget behind things to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: studies that they say they're going to do,
things are just gonna be continuing limbo
[SPEAKER_00]: from that side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's a drug, they're not allowed
to do that without it being adulterated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that the dialects is there
basically makes all that development
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible without going through the FDA
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to overseas in Germany,
we have very little users of extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guess is, I don't have the numbers
here, but my guess is we have less than 5%
[SPEAKER_02]: of medical users or even recreational
users using extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the numbers in the US,
George, about?
[SPEAKER_02]: You work in a lot of states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to BATS, how many people consume
liquids or consume extracts?
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the United States, most of the users
were medical a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now most of the users are recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that change, we're looking at that
industry growing as a gourmet industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're literally cooking for our customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're preparing the best experience for
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that said, I see in the last
years, vaping is going crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vaping and eatables versus the flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you agree that's the fastest growing
sector within the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jonah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that a lot in Oregon to where
initially like early on it was like 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was probably about 70,
80% flour sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's I think by 60, 70% more oil
is what you'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the oil is the catalyst for all
the other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just the vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the creams, the lotions, topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, it significantly surpassed
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we start to see that in all the new
states that come online as well too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty predictable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick, what do you think is the future of
extraction in Europe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think we will reach the US level
soon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how do you see the future of
extractions in Europe?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, hopefully it will get bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think extracts are more suited for the
pharmacies in the way they're working in
[SPEAKER_03]: their applications, the final products
that will be available.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're going to see more delivery
methods targeting specific treatments like
[SPEAKER_03]: different, like maybe inhalers,
soft mist inhalers, nasal sprays,
[SPEAKER_03]: this type of final products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, hopefully we're going to see
more of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: George, you work in several US states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the regulation all the same there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you have to like, okay, this counts
for Colorado, this counts for California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a big gap?
[SPEAKER_04]: Our regulations, of course, they're
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're different in a way.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the way of taxation and on the way of
licensing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything else seems to be like the
branding is allowed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you have a brand in one state,
that can propagate through all the states
[SPEAKER_04]: that are legal, which pretty much provides
same quality of extract everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, every state has a different
policy on taxation and licensing,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is the biggest difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in the United States,
certainly, basically the FDA has just
[SPEAKER_01]: issued eight DEA licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first federally allowed
licenses for the production basically of
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that is going to eclipse
the multi-state operator model within five
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply because once those drugs get
through the FDA, then the FDA will have
[SPEAKER_01]: action against the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll kind of see them flex their
muscles on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's what's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the federally illegal stuff
that's happening in the states is probably
[SPEAKER_01]: on its last legs, I think, in the next
five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think definitely we're going to have the
FDA running the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way it's been in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to continue to be that
way with these drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes me come to my final question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this step is the most important or
will give the cannabis industry a very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very big push when it's medical,
legal, federal in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this will still happen under
Biden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it looks like it's going to be
rescheduled sometime in September or
[SPEAKER_01]: November or September.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with five of the eight licensees
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've worked with the DEA,
which is the Drug Enforcement
[SPEAKER_01]: Administration, directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will have a ripple effect around
the world, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you agree it's a game changer,
George, if it's federally illegal as a
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine?
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That protest never really happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been talking about it in the last
two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I see that really the biggest problem
is, yes, FDA is going to need to take a
[SPEAKER_04]: call on the doses because they need to
issue proper doses for everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: For different ages, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are different kickbacks in every
state.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we market?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we license?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we do all those details?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, California, like two weeks ago,
they issued another limitation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot market strains and products
with kids' attractive names like candies,
[SPEAKER_04]: like all these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be a lot of limit.
[SPEAKER_04]: When that gets federally illegal,
there are going to be a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: limitations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they're ready to do that
this fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're ready, they're probably going
to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: My last question goes to Nick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick, we don't hear so much from Greece.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hear a lot about Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from Greece, on federal level,
do you think they will ease up cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: laws, also for medical cannabis in Greece
soon?
[SPEAKER_03]: We already have a framework that has been
around for five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't have so many patients,
do you?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have zero patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are preparing the framework.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are preparing the way these products
are going to enter the Greek pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been some moves from some big
players on how this will happen in
[SPEAKER_03]: combination with the classic
pharmaceutical companies that deliver
[SPEAKER_03]: these products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the main question is when and
how many and how easy it will become to
[SPEAKER_03]: become a patient and to actually have
access to this product, which I think this
[SPEAKER_03]: goes not only for Greece, but it goes for
all Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the previous questions that you
asked about FDA, hopefully what you say is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to happen in September.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this will allow Europe,
will allow maybe Germany to move a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: faster and without being afraid of FDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then if Germany moves forward,
then I think the rest of the Europe will
[SPEAKER_03]: follow that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it a little bit like Europe is
waiting for FDA, Germany is waiting for
[SPEAKER_03]: that, and the rest of Europe is waiting
for Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think the FDA move would be a game
changer also for Germany because also
[SPEAKER_02]: money transactions will be legal on
international level and this will be a big
[SPEAKER_02]: game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much to all panelists.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you again, Michael.
Thank you.
