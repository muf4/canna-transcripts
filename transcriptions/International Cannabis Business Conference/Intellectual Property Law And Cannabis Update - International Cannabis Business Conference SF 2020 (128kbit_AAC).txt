[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we're calling an intellectual
property law on cannabis update.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not intended as an introductory
primer to the entire field of copyrights,
[SPEAKER_01]: patents, trademarks, and trade secrets as
they apply to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really intended as an update of a
couple of new things that have happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last year, a couple of new interesting
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they're handing out, the piece of
paper, is my one piece of paper,
[SPEAKER_01]: two pages, back two sides cheat sheet that
is kind of my intellectual property law
[SPEAKER_01]: primer on two pieces of paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first page has a horizontal grid that
compares copyrights, patents, trademarks,
[SPEAKER_01]: and trade secrets, which are the four
basic intellectual property tools on five
[SPEAKER_01]: different criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can kind of get a feel for what the
differences are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you flip that over,
I created a fictional product that
[SPEAKER_01]: attempts to show how each of the tools can
be brought to life in a real product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason we're talking about this
is, part of the reason is, this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of work that I've been doing for four
decades in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clothing, electronics, restaurants,
music, TV, film, any kind of industry you
[SPEAKER_01]: can think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm based in San Diego, California,
but get up here all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about 10 years ago, a light bulb went
on that as this industry was starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: morph from an underground economy to a
real enterprise for entrepreneurs and
[SPEAKER_01]: creative people and businesses to help get
the medicine out, it dawned on me that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was only a matter of time before the
investors were going to start coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: and saying, I like your product,
I like your business, but how do I protect
[SPEAKER_01]: my investment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the collateral?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are the copyrights?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are the patents?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are the trademarks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are the trade secrets?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so about 10, 11 years ago,
I just started learning everything I could
[SPEAKER_01]: about the industry and taking what I knew
from intellectual property law in general
[SPEAKER_01]: and applying it to this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's been quite a few
developments in the last 10 or 11 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear a lot at this conference and all
conferences about branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, figure out what your brand is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Protect your brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out what your identity is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figure out what your personal brand is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my experience, particularly in the
cannabis industry, branding without
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property, IP, for short,
protection, they go hand in glove.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have IP protection but no brand,
that doesn't do you much good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a brand but no IP protection,
that doesn't do you much good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put the two together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got something that's going to be
of interest down the road as you grow your
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a lot's happened in the last year,
a lot of new developments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Given the few minutes we have,
I'm just going to touch on three or four
[SPEAKER_01]: of the ones that I think you'll find most
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Afterwards, I'll make myself available
outside or downstairs at the lobby bar,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending, and I'll be happy to answer
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's really different this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's changed in the last year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about for a moment trademarks,
brand names, logos, brand identifiers,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that identifies your brand from
somebody else's brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exxon Kodak, Xerox, Mrs. Fields,
Apple, so forth and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all trademarks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nike Swoosh, it's a trademark.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Yahoo Yodel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a trademark.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these brand identifiers that separate
your brand from the competitor's brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a hot area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we talk about what's changed,
let's talk about what hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What hasn't changed, and it's still the
big conundrum for the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patent and Trademark Office, PTO for
short, will still not allow a U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: trademark registration for anything that
is cannabis contains cannabis or touches
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: By touching cannabis, I mean retail
stores, testing labs, and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delivery services.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a real problem in this industry in
getting federal trademark protection for
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what people like me like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spend a lot of time trying to figure
out what the alternative strategies are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what has changed in the last year is
because on December 20th of 2018,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Farm Bill of 2018 was signed,
starting last year, 2019, the Federal
[SPEAKER_01]: Trademark Office started allowing
trademark applications for hemp and
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD-derived products, or hemp-derived CBD
products, with less than .3%.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is monumental breakthrough for the
Trademark Office, because for the last 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years, the Federal Trademark Office has
had a total block blanket wall against any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of trademark applications for
cannabis or CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are or intend to be in the CBD
business, you now have the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: get some federal trademark protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in December, six months ago,
we finally started seeing the first
[SPEAKER_01]: trademark registrations actually being
issued and granted for CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's news.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also think that... Now, let me back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge with CBD applications or
applications for CBD products is the
[SPEAKER_01]: Trademark Office will no longer use the
Controlled Substances Act as a basis for
[SPEAKER_01]: rejection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be rejecting your federal
trademark application, but it will cite
[SPEAKER_01]: the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
which doesn't allow orally ingestible
[SPEAKER_01]: products to be marketed commercially,
at least as far as the FDA is concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Patent and Trademark Office will
reject a trademark application for orally
[SPEAKER_01]: ingested CBD products on the basis of the
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, not the
[SPEAKER_01]: Controlled Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't think that they're gonna do that
for sublinguals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think they're gonna draw a distinction
between other orally ingested products and
[SPEAKER_01]: sublinguals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exactly sure, other than the FDA
considers sublinguals not to be
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritional supplements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some opportunities there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else can you do on the federal level
if you can't get a trademark registration
[SPEAKER_01]: for your cannabis product or your cannabis
service or your CBD product because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: orally ingested?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you gotta...
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll excuse the phrase, plant some
seeds, by filing trademark applications
[SPEAKER_01]: for ancillary goods and services,
clothing, educational services,
[SPEAKER_01]: website information, classes, videos,
those topics, those products and services,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though they concern cannabis,
do not violate the Controlled Substances
[SPEAKER_01]: Act because they aren't cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't touch cannabis, don't contain
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may not be able to get a trademark
registration today for your cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: product, but you can for ancillary goods
and services.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good thing to do, build up some
protection, plant some seeds for the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the things that's changed in
the last year is California, the fifth
[SPEAKER_01]: largest economy in the world, arguably
therefore the most important economy,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis economy in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: California now is allowing trademark
registrations for cannabis products and
[SPEAKER_01]: services if you are licensed to provide
your product or your service by the state
[SPEAKER_01]: of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a prerequisite, but you can get a
trademark registration for your cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: product or service in California,
which you can't get federally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Given the fact that California is the
fifth largest economy in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, most other states that allow
for either medical or recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis also allow state trademark
registrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the old days, most trademark lawyers
were only concerned about federal
[SPEAKER_01]: trademarks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't give two hoots about state
trademarks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this economy and in this world
where cannabis is hindered by federal
[SPEAKER_01]: illegality, state trademark registration
is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, state of California will allow
you to file your trademark application
[SPEAKER_01]: online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something they didn't allow until last
year, that's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can search for other trademark
registrations that have already been
[SPEAKER_01]: issued online.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something new in the last 12 months
that you couldn't do a year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might as well, before you file your
trademark application, spend your time,
[SPEAKER_01]: spend your money, see if anybody else has
already gotten a trademark registration
[SPEAKER_01]: for the same or similar trademark so you
don't run up against a brick wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, the state, what also is new is
the state of California trademark unit is
[SPEAKER_01]: applying a much more strict scrutiny,
looking much more closely at California
[SPEAKER_01]: trademark applications to make sure that
the packaging and labeling is California
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your packaging doesn't comply with
California law, they will reject the
[SPEAKER_01]: trademark application and tell you to go
back and fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that the trademark office is
looking at these trademark applications
[SPEAKER_01]: much more closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is new?
[SPEAKER_01]: Last month, Kiva Health versus Kiva
Brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show of hands, everybody familiar with
Kiva Edibles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kiva Edibles has been around for quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's another company called Kiva
Health, a non-cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sued Kiva Brands in federal court for
trademark infringement, not state court,
[SPEAKER_01]: federal court, for trademark infringement,
claiming that Kiva Health had a trademark
[SPEAKER_01]: registration Kiva Brands was infringing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kiva Brands, Kiva Edibles, filed a
counterclaim, a cross-claim saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, not so fast, Kiva Health.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have unregistered common law trademark
rights based on our long-standing use of
[SPEAKER_01]: Kiva for Edibles in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may not have it registered for Edibles,
but we've got common law rights based on
[SPEAKER_01]: our long-standing sale of Kiva branded
products, which is, by the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: a valid legal doctrine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to have a trademark
registration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good to have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not required by law to have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have these common law rights if you've
been selling the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the court dismissed Kiva
Brands' counterclaims against Kiva Health,
[SPEAKER_01]: said, sorry, cannabis is illegal under
federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in federal court.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to give your common law
claims any credence in federal court.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a game changer for brands and for
trademark enforcement rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it means a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay away from federal court if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build up your ancillary trademark
registrations on the federal level for
[SPEAKER_01]: those non-radioactive products and
services, clothing, educational services,
[SPEAKER_01]: website information, so forth and so on,
and get your state trademark
[SPEAKER_01]: registrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a possibility that if you have
more of your foundational bricks in place,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might be able to avoid a similar fate
that happened to poor Kiva Brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, hindsight's 20-20, but I'm thinking
now if I have a client that's being
[SPEAKER_01]: threatened with trademark infringement
lawsuit by somebody, I may not sit around
[SPEAKER_01]: for too long waiting to see what happens
and going back and forth with the letter
[SPEAKER_01]: writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have a client and the phone calls and
can't we all be friends, what I might do
[SPEAKER_01]: is I might go racing into state court here
in California and file a preemptive
[SPEAKER_01]: trademark action called a declaratory
relief action in state court where I think
[SPEAKER_01]: my client might get a better shake from
the judge than in federal court and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: judge, we've been threatened, my client's
been threatened with trademark
[SPEAKER_01]: infringement by this other company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm filing suit now because I want a
declaration from you that we do have valid
[SPEAKER_01]: and enforceable common law trademark
rights and maybe state trademark
[SPEAKER_01]: registrations too, and I want to preempt
this and get this into state court and
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it out of federal court.
[SPEAKER_01]: The federal court conundrum is also
rearing its ugly little head in claims,
[SPEAKER_01]: litigation claims that are coming up now
also in the patent and trade secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ironically, you can't get a federal
trademark registration for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products and services from the patent and
trademark office.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get a trademark registration if
you walk in the patent door.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, if you walk in the trademark
door, but if you walk in the patent door,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can because there's nothing in the
federal patent law that says the patent
[SPEAKER_01]: office is not allowed to grant a patent
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a prohibition against granting a
trademark.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a specific prohibition by law
against granting a trademark registration
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis, but not for patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis patents are issuing by the
dozens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not they'll be enforced in
federal court, which is the only place you
[SPEAKER_01]: can go to sue for patent infringement,
same with copyrights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only go to federal court.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the cases that are starting to
rear their heads now, 2019, 2020,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the good old days when I first started
doing this work 10 years ago, there were
[SPEAKER_01]: no lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody was suing everybody, anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was holding hands, singing
kumbaya, we're all in this together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then about 2014, 2015, when Colorado,
Washington, and Oregon went legal,
[SPEAKER_01]: the stakes started rising, more money
started floating in, and you started
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing non-cannabis companies suing
cannabis companies over cannabis parodies,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Hashi's instead of Hershey's,
and Ganja Joy instead of Almond Joy,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so forth and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starbucks filed some lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you started seeing non-cannabis
companies suing cannabis companies over
[SPEAKER_01]: these so-called parodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was where most of the litigation
was between 2014 and 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then 2018, 2019 is when we started seeing
cannabis companies suing cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hadn't seen any of that really before
2018, but it was sort of the inevitable
[SPEAKER_01]: consequence of the increase in the
financial stakes that's taking place and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the money that's floating in and
coming into the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has happened for 100, 200 years in
our society.
[SPEAKER_01]: As new industries come online and become
more mature, the bigger players,
[SPEAKER_01]: the players who are more aggressive,
realize after a period of time that they
[SPEAKER_01]: can use the litigation system to cripple
their competitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying it's a good thing,
but it's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens not just in this industry,
but it's starting to happen in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if I'm invited back next year,
I'm predicting I'll probably have 10 or 12
[SPEAKER_01]: different trademark copyright patent trade
secret infringement lawsuits where one
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis company is suing another cannabis
company to report to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my recommendation for 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, what else is new in 2020?
[SPEAKER_01]: Copyrights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we can't get trademark
registrations on the federal level for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis products for the illegality
problem, the Controlled Substances Act,
[SPEAKER_01]: copyright registrations for your logos,
your graphic designs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like let's take the ICBC logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got all this rich detail in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the bridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the tower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the sails.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the green.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I call a graphically rich
logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just a horizontal line and a
vertical line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some real content to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That graphically rich logo that you see up
there, and which hopefully many of you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to identify and distinguish your
brands, those can also be registered not
[SPEAKER_01]: just as trademarks, but with the copyright
office.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the letters ICBC, but all the
graphics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copyright protects content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Graphics, illustrations, drawings,
photographs, computer programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because we can't get trademark
registrations for cannabis products,
[SPEAKER_01]: copyright registrations to be filed with
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copyright Office, copyright.gov.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: $55, the best bargain around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it online yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be happy to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or guys, people like me are happy to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, if you have the bandwidth,
you have the patience, and want to open up
[SPEAKER_01]: an account, you can do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting about copyright
registrations for graphically rich logos,
[SPEAKER_01]: the copyright office doesn't care that
your business is a cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have no prohibition against
granting a copyright registration to a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're agnostic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fill out the form right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pay the fee.
[SPEAKER_01]: You provide the specimen the evidence of
what it is that you're using your
[SPEAKER_01]: copyright on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to register that copyright
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if somebody infringes your copyright,
you get to go to federal court,
[SPEAKER_01]: not state court.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't know, but we don't know how
judges in federal court are going to view
[SPEAKER_01]: copyright infringement claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're going to be favorable,
but I don't know that for a fact yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least you have the copyright
registration, and you have something to
[SPEAKER_01]: hang your hat on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other advantage of copyright
registrations, as a supplement to all your
[SPEAKER_01]: trademark registrations, is unlike the
trademark office, which divides all goods
[SPEAKER_01]: and services into 45 different categories,
and you have to pay a filing fee of either
[SPEAKER_01]: $225 per category, or $275 per category.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to file for clothing and
educational services and website
[SPEAKER_01]: information, that's going to be three
categories at $225 a pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The copyright office essentially has one
category, $55.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're selling, you're putting your
trademark on cannabis and clothing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and somebody puts it on lunchboxes and
bedsheets, you can make a claim against
[SPEAKER_01]: them for copyright infringement without
having to pay $55 times three,
[SPEAKER_01]: four, five categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really bullish on copyright
applications for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, four or five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mind taking a few questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a few questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You let me know when we're done,
Aguayo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with the growing litigation over the
trademark registrations, if someone is to
[SPEAKER_03]: go to federal court and lose, what type of
liability do you think their attorneys are
[SPEAKER_03]: taking on, and what is the risk for
malpractice advising them on something we
[SPEAKER_03]: expect to go to court and be challenged
and most likely not be of help?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a risk, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any time you're out on the cutting edge,
whether you're just giving advice or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you're litigating, when you're the
lawyer and you're out on the cutting edge,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever industry you're in, whether it's
cannabis or weapons of mass destruction or
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol and other controlled substances,
there's always a risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a risk that the advice that you
give a client is somehow going to
[SPEAKER_01]: backfire.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to mitigate that risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to use our brains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to talk to our colleagues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to talk to the other partners in
our law firm and make sure we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: making obvious mistakes so as to mitigate
that risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're out at the cutting edge,
sometimes you got to push the envelope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's part of our job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether or not something rises to the
level of malpractice, boy, that's a tough
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for others who are smarter than I
am to answer definitively.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's part of the reason lawyers charge
what they charge, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, lawyer hourly rates, if any of you
have hired lawyers, you know they're
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty high, no pun intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: Higher than everyone in this room right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But part of the reason is because we have
to cover that risk and pay outrageous
[SPEAKER_01]: malpractice rates per year to cover those
risks when we push the envelope.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't want to push the envelope,
we shouldn't be in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should represent yogurt companies and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that answers your question,
but I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any companies who have
successfully defended their name as a
[SPEAKER_02]: copyright or some of the other ways you're
suggesting in the ancillary fashion
[SPEAKER_02]: against someone who else?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't hear the beginning of the
question, and Gaio, could you repeat it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she said are there companies who
have successfully defended their
[SPEAKER_00]: copyright?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you suggest getting a copyright instead
of a trademark or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you have a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are there examples of people using that
successfully in court to defend their
[SPEAKER_00]: property?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, the amount of litigation that
we're seeing in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can almost literally count on two hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's just very little
litigation right now that's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's going to be a lot more
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen any copyright infringement
lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen trademark infringement lawsuits,
patent infringement lawsuits, trade secret
[SPEAKER_01]: infringement lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not copyright.
