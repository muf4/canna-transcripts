[SPEAKER_00]: Our next panel, which is starting right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moderator for this panel is a lawyer,
which is awesome today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just presented to Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were talking to the councils about
how to legalize and what it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: mean to legalize for adults in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's got a whole panel,
and they're all going to talk about it
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, and it's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for Bernardo Soriano-Guzman
and the rest of the panelists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make some noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, come on.
Hi,
[SPEAKER_05]: how are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's impressive to be here after these two
complicated years in the context we've
[SPEAKER_05]: lived.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just remember that it was two years ago,
when we were here, ready to start ICBC,
[SPEAKER_05]: that the fair was suspended.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when this context started.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so great to be back at these events
and to meet again with so many colleagues
[SPEAKER_05]: and all the industry to resume the
activity in a strong way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very happy to be here today with three
people whom I admire a lot and to be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to share this panel with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, even though this context of
pandemic has taken place, the activity in
[SPEAKER_05]: Spain regarding legislative progress has
been quite important.
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been up to four regulation laws
in different areas in the last four
[SPEAKER_05]: months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two of them have not been considered.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two others that are pending.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them completely regulates the
production cycle of the plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: the access to the users, developing up to
14 types of licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to discuss this law with
these three people I have with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the one hand, Rubén Valenzuela,
CTO of Valender Veras and co-founder of
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis Hub, which is an entity that has
been created to support the industry and
[SPEAKER_05]: serve as a connection between different
companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rubén has been in the cannabis industry
for many years, in different sectors.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is an agronomist and industrial
engineer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure he will contribute a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other hand, there is Sergio
González.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is an activist and has been managing a
cannabis club for many years.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is also a reference in this regard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he is leading a movement, the 420
movement, in order to get the necessary
[SPEAKER_05]: support for this law to be taken into
consideration and be able to move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other hand, Iker Waal, CEO of
Sovereign Fields and one of the people who
[SPEAKER_05]: is also a reference in the sector with a
25-year career in the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has gone through all the possible parts
of the cannabis phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having explained the current situation at
the legislative level, we have to realize
[SPEAKER_05]: that, on the other hand, the current
context, despite the fact that we are in a
[SPEAKER_05]: fair where there are hundreds of seats and
there is a frantic activity, we have very
[SPEAKER_05]: good news from other places where
regulation is already being talked about.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are mainly excited that it is talked
about in Germany, because what happens in
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany tends to have transcendence in the
rest of the countries of the European
Union.
[SPEAKER_05]: We believe that we are in a moment that
has no way back.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will have to keep pushing.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I wanted to ask you for a
brief balance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two minutes on the current situation and
then we will comment on the subject.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you like, Rubén, you can start.
[SPEAKER_04]: Initially, I would like to thank Bernardo
and the whole organization for the
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity to come here and talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is a very important issue and,
in summary, with only two minutes,
[SPEAKER_04]: it is clear that Bernardo had already
proposed that this market already exists.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these actions are happening and
currently they are not regulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are lucky that there are people who
have worked on a solid proposal that I
[SPEAKER_04]: think reaches all the parts that we need,
that takes into account all the social
[SPEAKER_04]: groups and it is a regulation,
I think, from my point of view,
[SPEAKER_04]: the best we can have in Spain and the one
that could complete and could allow the
[SPEAKER_04]: force of cannabis to reach all the working
groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have seen different regulations in the
world and, in this case, I think it is one
[SPEAKER_04]: that is very complete and that can help us
all to really benefit from cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: that all society can benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it is a pleasure to be here to talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that we will convey the importance
of being here and, of course, with a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of desire for this to happen, since I
think that all of us are going to benefit
[SPEAKER_04]: from this regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, nothing more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning to all of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I would like to thank
Bernardo, who has organized this table,
[SPEAKER_06]: the organisation that has had the
opportunity to talk about this issue and
[SPEAKER_06]: that we can talk about it here in this
framework and to all of you for coming
[SPEAKER_06]: here and being involved and involved in
this industry, in this sector,
[SPEAKER_06]: that, although they are not doing it,
it is coming out of the closet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, Bernardo, that you were
specifically referring to a photo of the
[SPEAKER_06]: current situation, of how we see it from
the point of view.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, currently, I would summarize the
situation in two words.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uncertainty and illusion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uncertainty because, every day,
the people we work with in this sector,
[SPEAKER_06]: it doesn't matter what part of the sector
it is, it doesn't matter if it is within
[SPEAKER_06]: Semillas, if it is within a gross-up,
cannabis social clubs, cannabis companies,
[SPEAKER_06]: we are currently in a limbo in which we
see ourselves in the situation of managing
[SPEAKER_06]: things as well as we can and within our
honesty and our moral capacity because we
[SPEAKER_06]: don't have any type of regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, tomorrow you will be intervened by
DINAFEM, you will be involved in all the
[SPEAKER_06]: Granada groups, the next day you will be
inspected in all the clubs in Barcelona,
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's how we are.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think the situation is this.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have uncertainty because, really,
every day we wake up without knowing how
[SPEAKER_06]: we are going to end the day, if we are
going to be able to continue working
[SPEAKER_06]: normally and return to our homes with our
families, or we are going to go to jail,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we have great hope because we have a
tool, which is the proposal of the I420,
[SPEAKER_06]: in which many people within the sector
have been able to contribute our grain of
[SPEAKER_06]: sand, and also I think it is a very
faithful reflection of what we currently
[SPEAKER_06]: have in Spain, and we really have hope
because this can go forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, right now, uncertainty and hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a luxury to be back after two years,
almost three, to be here again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is going to be a very
interesting week with many connections,
[SPEAKER_03]: many people that we had not seen before,
and the truth is that thanks to Bernardo
[SPEAKER_03]: and the organisation for getting us on
this panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: The truth is that the situation is
complex, but sometimes you start to see
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that now that they have this issue
of Facebook with the issue of the Italian
[SPEAKER_03]: metaverse, I think of the cannabis
metaverse, everything that we have in
[SPEAKER_03]: Spain, all the actors that there are,
all the associative movement, a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: energies that are interacting,
and I hope that this solidifies in a
[SPEAKER_03]: proposal that can provide legal security,
that fundamental rights are recognised.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, I think it is a whole process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been evolving and interacting for
many years now, and I think it is a
[SPEAKER_03]: progressive issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, when they regulated euthanasia,
and you were talking to the activists who
[SPEAKER_03]: have been working on that, they had spent
40 years, and even so, the regulation they
[SPEAKER_03]: had was not adequate, or they were not
100% satisfied.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, many times, cannabis has to,
or should, do an exercise of looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: other sectors, other social movements,
and how it is evolving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, on the other hand, we have this
proposal from Podemos, which comes
[SPEAKER_03]: together with the proposal from Más País
and IRC, which I see as already a
[SPEAKER_03]: crystallisation of legislative proposals,
which is already reaching the Congress.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that debate already, although the
whole run-run was there, in some way these
[SPEAKER_03]: legislative proposals already represent a
point, perhaps an end of the cycle,
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it a bit, and now a whole scenario
opens up in which there is a lot to work
[SPEAKER_03]: on, a lot to regulate, a lot of pedagogy,
a lot of education that needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, in that sense, congratulations
to the political parties that have bet on
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to propose it, even though the
debate in Spain is still very,
[SPEAKER_03]: contradictory, very green.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I think it is key, or what do you
say, the complete disconnection that
[SPEAKER_05]: exists regarding the reality of the
sector, of activism, of how cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: phenomenon is integrated in our society,
regarding the neanderthal laws that we
[SPEAKER_05]: have that regulate the issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is precisely, as we say,
the law intends to give legal security to
[SPEAKER_05]: a multitude of activities, many of them,
because we have been developing with
[SPEAKER_05]: normality, such as, for example,
to go into detail with the issue of the
[SPEAKER_05]: production and commercialisation of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have always said that the issue of the
seeds was a giant with mud feet,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is basically the basis of the
industry, but its support was based on a
[SPEAKER_05]: question that was not too honest,
but that has allowed us to carry out that
[SPEAKER_05]: activity for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, going back a bit to ask you,
because you are a well-known person in
[SPEAKER_05]: this sector, from the origins,
what do you think can happen now with the
[SPEAKER_05]: issue of the seeds?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you value the last movements that
are taking place?
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know, well, we have news about the
case of Dinafem, as Sergio has commented,
[SPEAKER_05]: with the last interventions to Grossovsk.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think is going to happen now?
[SPEAKER_05]: How can this be solved?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the issue is complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seed is the beginning of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we could say that the seed has been
the product that initially stimulated
[SPEAKER_03]: activism, because self-consumption in
Spain is something quite referential,
[SPEAKER_03]: the associative movement as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is something that is unique at
the level of Europe, the power and the
movements.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact of starting to introduce the
seed and the cultivating people having
[SPEAKER_03]: access to or being able to self-cultivate
plants of higher quality, different
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds of cannabinoids, that was a
revolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Around all of that, the last 20 years have
been created, because this started in
[SPEAKER_03]: Holland, but already in 2004 in Holland
they began to have legal problems and the
[SPEAKER_03]: companies began to move mainly to Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, of course, now you find that we have
a business only on the subject of the seed
[SPEAKER_03]: of probably 150 to 200 million that it
generates, that is, it is already a fairly
[SPEAKER_03]: strong industry that generates many jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, it also begins to be
seen as, by the powers, by the State,
[SPEAKER_03]: by the police, by the judges, the seed as
a precursor of the crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seed is not prosecuted at the
international level.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem resides in the origin of
how that seed is produced.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, commercialization until now had not
been a problem, a crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, exponentially, in the case of
DINAFEN, which is one of the main
[SPEAKER_03]: companies, the State gets involved and
manages to close it completely and send a
[SPEAKER_03]: notice similar to when it happened with
the social clubs in 2012-2014 with Panag,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was referential.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how they went to one of the
referential clubs and that served a little
[SPEAKER_03]: to scare the rest of the clubs that were
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think they have done the same here
now and they are making a proposal with
[SPEAKER_03]: the subject of the seed to twist it and
propose that if you are growing illicit
[SPEAKER_03]: plants from which you get a product or a
residue that, although it is not
[SPEAKER_03]: prosecuted, but you are making money with
that, well, that is already a crime.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a crime of capital, it is a crime of
health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the truth is that this is a problem
because, obviously, there is a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: sector behind that is being affected and
that has been recycling for two years and
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing how to focus on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think it is very interesting,
for example, in Podemos, the law of
[SPEAKER_03]: Podemos, which proposes how to regulate
this, that obviously there are
[SPEAKER_03]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, in the law of viveros and seeds
there is an article in which the subject
[SPEAKER_03]: is not yet regulated, which is the seeds
of collectionism and that is pending to be
[SPEAKER_03]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there is the part of the
administrative illicit zone of the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in theory, what the State is
proposing is that the only seed that can
[SPEAKER_03]: be marketed is that seed that is included
in the register, in the common catalog,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that if the majority of them are
intended for fiber or for food,
[SPEAKER_03]: they are seeds of hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is in a quite powerful legal
vacuum and that is then crashing with the
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical industry, which is also
starting to settle, both in Portugal and
[SPEAKER_03]: Spain, and that, obviously, the agencies
are requiring an illicit origin of
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties that have THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in Europe there is no such register,
there is an institute of the CPVO that can
[SPEAKER_03]: protect intellectual property,
but there is no such register,
[SPEAKER_03]: as they say, it is carried by each agency
with the varieties that are being
[SPEAKER_03]: developed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, in that respect, for example,
Spain is a pioneer in companies that are
[SPEAKER_03]: dedicated to the genetic issue,
that have authorization and that are
[SPEAKER_03]: developing breeding and developing
intellectual property, and that is a
[SPEAKER_03]: phenomenon that in Spain there are,
we are like six or seven companies
[SPEAKER_03]: dedicated to this, and you go to Italy and
you do not see, you do not see Greece,
[SPEAKER_03]: in Portugal, that there are a lot of
factories of medicinal cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: there are also no companies of genetics,
that is giving an opportunity for
[SPEAKER_03]: companies from Canada and South America
also to be able to enter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, the truth is that the scenario
is complex, but at the same time it is
[SPEAKER_03]: being positioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, well, let's see how it evolves.
[SPEAKER_03]: The companies themselves that sell seeds
are also already organizing themselves,
[SPEAKER_03]: in their day a legal report has already
been required, but now they are updating
[SPEAKER_03]: it because there is also an offensive from
the government that, instead of
[SPEAKER_03]: regulating, in the face of all the problem
they have, they prefer to give a slap and
[SPEAKER_03]: repress before regulating, and now it is a
bit, it is a complex issue of the seed,
[SPEAKER_03]: it would be like a whole panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you have made quite clear the
existing problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: I consider this to be key, that you point
out that once the industry, after so many
[SPEAKER_05]: attempts, is coordinating for this final
stretch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another of the most problematic issues in
recent years, and that the law also
[SPEAKER_05]: regulates, is non-psychoactive cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this case, regulation is raised in the
capacity to produce inferior cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: less than 1% of total THC, and produce
products made with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Recently, this week, we have also known
that Nobel Foods, based in CBD,
has been able to register for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last movements in France, in December,
where flower extraction is enabled for CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: production, even after the suspension of
the flower sale, prohibition of the sale
[SPEAKER_05]: of flowers has now been suspended.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a need for a final resolution.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Spain, we are waiting for a sentence
from the Supreme Court regarding the
[SPEAKER_05]: possibility of flower marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rubén, you, with the other company that
participates, you are the founder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Canaveras supports all this type of
companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you value the current situation and
how could this regulation help to
[SPEAKER_05]: consolidate, for example, the work you do
in Spain?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the question, Bernardo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, we have seen an evolution of
this market in Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very curious, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Five years ago, since the appearance in
Switzerland, we began to see that it was
[SPEAKER_04]: an emerging market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, Spain has very good agronomic
characteristics, in addition to a cannabis
culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw that part of the crops that were
being displaced, especially ornamental
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers, could be produced in Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, curiously, with new locations,
with very good productivity, and with a
[SPEAKER_04]: very low production cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a great lack of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, the police did not know how it
worked, how it worked, there was something
[SPEAKER_04]: that nobody knew, and from there,
companies began to develop.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these companies, not to mention 95% of
them, have ended up deriving, or going to
[SPEAKER_04]: Italy, or going to Austria, almost all to
Italy, in this case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we do not have a regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only we do not have a regulation,
but there has been a persecution in
[SPEAKER_04]: relation to these crops, when it really
does not have any logic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since, for the sake of free trade,
we all know that there are a lot of CBD
stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, what we are doing is that we
are stopping Spanish farmers and
[SPEAKER_04]: entrepreneurs from developing this
industry, which is not psychoactive
[SPEAKER_04]: either.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have already seen that other regulatory
models in the world work, there is a great
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Switzerland, for example, is carrying the
burden of all this together with Italy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, unfortunately, without a regulation,
we are out of the game.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would happen if we had that
regulation and it allowed us to start
[SPEAKER_04]: working with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as Iker Ro has commented,
we have a very important cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_04]: in Spain, surely one of the pioneers in
Europe, with a lot of desire to work and
[SPEAKER_04]: see how it can develop in taxes and,
after all, benefits for all society.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is a great topic, as to give another
panel, the issue of CBD or CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, really, a regulation is required,
because, as I have said, free trade allows
[SPEAKER_04]: commercialization and, therefore,
the only thing they are doing is that they
[SPEAKER_04]: are putting stones on a Spanish car
because they have a lot of power,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of desire, but hopefully soon there
will be a regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think it is also very important
what you are proposing, especially
[SPEAKER_05]: because, in the end, what the Spanish
authorities are doing is to interpret in a
[SPEAKER_05]: very restrictive way European regulations
and European regulations and international
[SPEAKER_05]: agreements that other countries in our own
European environment interpret in a more
[SPEAKER_05]: flexible way, giving more dynamism and the
possibility of growth to that industry in
[SPEAKER_05]: comparison with what is happening in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are not only in this absurd thesis
that because it has a flower shape it is
[SPEAKER_05]: considered taxed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the logical thing would be if it had
some kind of stupefying effect,
[SPEAKER_05]: that it was controlled.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, well, we are in this absurd.
[SPEAKER_05]: To change the subject a bit, Sergio,
one of the issues that the law raises is
[SPEAKER_05]: the regulation of cannabis social clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a somewhat controversial issue
because, really, this regulation for the
[SPEAKER_05]: first time raises a distinction between
those cannabis social clubs that the law
[SPEAKER_05]: calls cooperatives that have a functioning
similar to their origin, to the origin of
[SPEAKER_05]: the first cannabis social clubs,
distinguishing them from other cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: social clubs in this case licensed,
that would become companies and would have
[SPEAKER_05]: different obligations to those of the
cooperative social clubs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted you to give me a bit of an
analysis of the same and tell me what
[SPEAKER_05]: perceptions you have of whether this is
positive to fit it in this way,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first of all, I deeply appreciate
that you ask me this question because I
[SPEAKER_06]: think it is a very interesting topic and
currently it is very latent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it is unfair to start this
topic without making a deep reflection.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the people who are here,
during the last nine years, have led a
[SPEAKER_06]: consumer club that could perfectly fit
into any of the two models that are being
[SPEAKER_06]: proposed right now within the law,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And previously, I also participated for
six years in a cultivator club,
[SPEAKER_06]: only cultivators, and this leads me to
take a look at how we were born,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: What was our reality?
[SPEAKER_06]: Our reality by doing a bit of a follow-up
of what the colleagues have commented,
[SPEAKER_06]: both Iker and Rubén.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Spain we have a tradition of social
mobilization, we have had a strong
[SPEAKER_06]: capacity for organization and in the end
we have looked for life.
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, the clubs of cannabis,
being honest, just as we have developed,
[SPEAKER_06]: we did not have a legal engagement in
which to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have been opening the engagement.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, when we get to the moment when we
have an opportunity, through a legislative
[SPEAKER_06]: text, to order all this and be honest and
try to find a solution to the problem that
[SPEAKER_06]: we have right now, just like the seeds,
just like non-psychoactive cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: we are up to a giant that, just like
[SPEAKER_06]: non-psychoactive cannabis, we are up to a
giant that,
[SPEAKER_06]: just like non-psychoactive pre-marked and
in which we have to see ourselves guided
[SPEAKER_06]: in a unique way to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives us the option of being able to
decide how to work.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we really want to be a group of people
who get together in an associative way
[SPEAKER_06]: without any kind of profit intention or
any kind of intention of generating
[SPEAKER_06]: economic capacity simply by the fact of
getting together to cultivate and
[SPEAKER_06]: distribute the cannabis that we cultivate
among the people that we have gathered,
[SPEAKER_06]: then we are going to have the option of
doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they are the co-operative clubs
that we have in the law.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we want to be like any of these
clubs that already exist in Spain,
[SPEAKER_06]: that has three, four headquarters,
in this case with the law, then it would
[SPEAKER_06]: be a maximum of three, which is already a
lot for the management that we have right
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But any club that wants to follow that
line, that wants to have a business
[SPEAKER_06]: nature, that wants to progress
business-wise, that wants to generate
[SPEAKER_06]: work, generate wealth, generate taxes,
that has the capacity to progress,
[SPEAKER_06]: that has the capacity to collaborate with
other companies, that has the capacity to
[SPEAKER_06]: integrate within the sector, that can
interact with production companies,
[SPEAKER_06]: that can interact with extraction
companies, that can produce their own
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, then it seems to me an option
that, as I say, is already working
[SPEAKER_06]: currently, because we all know clubs that
have three headquarters in Spain,
[SPEAKER_06]: we all know the theme right now that we
have on the islands, what we have had in
[SPEAKER_06]: Barcelona in recent years, and from within
the feeling that it is a decent way out,
[SPEAKER_06]: it is a way to end all this process of all
these years, to look for life,
[SPEAKER_06]: to look for our space, to look for our
gap, and to find our space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rubén, you are working on a new analysis
technology that you are presenting here at
[SPEAKER_05]: the fair.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you are at the Stand Energy
Control, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And well, this analysis technology,
I wanted you to make a little assessment
[SPEAKER_05]: with all the fit within what is proposed
in the law, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Of quality control and product
traceability, that you tell us a little
[SPEAKER_05]: about the importance of all those
processes to show that a regulation is
[SPEAKER_05]: really controllable, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: For the administration, that this is not
going to be, let's say, an anarchy,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that there is going to be a control,
an order to be able to develop it,
[SPEAKER_05]: that you tell us a little about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, a great topic too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just the other day at a symposium in
the technological town, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Several companies in Uruguay raised the
idea between, curiously, the regulatory
[SPEAKER_04]: model in Uruguay allows associations and
also allows pharmaceutical companies,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they raised how pharmaceutical
companies, at the price they sold
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, had difficulties or,
in some way, many users preferred to go to
[SPEAKER_04]: what would be a cannabis club to finally
be able to access cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the difference?
[SPEAKER_04]: That there was no quality control.
[SPEAKER_04]: The quality control, since, well,
it was justified that this process was
[SPEAKER_04]: very expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is true that the analytical techniques
today require an HPC or a gas,
[SPEAKER_04]: in addition to different techniques to
know heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And well, basically, this was a help from
the European Union that they gave us to
[SPEAKER_04]: the company Valenveras to develop this
technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is called NIR, it is a technology that
basically takes a photo of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: gives us a series of properties with,
let's say, a very economical system,
[SPEAKER_04]: in a very flexible way, where,
in some way, anyone could put cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: there, see if it is valid or not for
consumption and, in some way, facilitate
[SPEAKER_04]: that we can access a quality consumption
without a requirement of a technology,
[SPEAKER_04]: of a laboratory or, let's say,
of a great technification.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, they do not have the same
precision, but we do consider that it can
[SPEAKER_04]: be a very important fit for not having
anything, which is what we have today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can have a simple and easy-to-use
system that, in some way, can help us know
[SPEAKER_04]: that it has the necessary quality control
so that it can be consumed and we can not
[SPEAKER_04]: have any other problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: The peculiarities of the technology is
that different readings can be included in
[SPEAKER_04]: that same system and, therefore,
we could achieve a quality control
[SPEAKER_04]: established with software, with total
traceability, with blockchain,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is what I think will give us that
traceability in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both cannabis products and hemp products.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you end up having a hemp teapot that
you know where it has grown, what variety,
[SPEAKER_04]: who has processed it, how it has had it.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the same way, when you go to get a
flower, even if it is in a club,
[SPEAKER_04]: or in the way the law proposes,
that you have a traceability with
[SPEAKER_04]: blockchain and with a system that ensures
that that is what you are accessing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it is a system that is already
used in agriculture and the truth is that
[SPEAKER_04]: we are very excited to see how we install
it in cannabis and how it can help this
[SPEAKER_04]: move forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Rubén.
[SPEAKER_05]: Iker, although this law does not regulate
medicinal cannabis, since the strategic
[SPEAKER_05]: proposal that was made of it was not to
mix these issues, because it was a matter
[SPEAKER_05]: of strategy and the possibility of success
for the Socialist Party, the current party
[SPEAKER_05]: of the government of Spain.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the red lines that it had was not
to mix both concepts in the same law and,
[SPEAKER_05]: on the other hand, not to carry the
debates in parallel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just two days ago, the Subcommittee on
Medicinal Cannabis has started in
[SPEAKER_05]: Congress, which is studying the
possibility of implementing regulation of
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: After many years of effort and work,
pushed, among other things, by the Spanish
[SPEAKER_05]: Observatory on Medicinal Cannabis in a
very intense way, I would like you to make
[SPEAKER_05]: a little assessment of what you expect
from this subcommittee and the
[SPEAKER_05]: possibilities of... I do not know if,
before making that assessment with
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal, to make a couple of tips with
what Sergio and Rubén have proposed on the
[SPEAKER_03]: one hand, with the issue of social clubs,
which I have also been for many years,
[SPEAKER_03]: now I see it from the outside,
but the issue of social clubs,
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it positive that in the law the
question of the operational philosophy of
[SPEAKER_03]: the clubs is addressed, which can be from
the social or smaller, to the
[SPEAKER_03]: cooperativist, with more activity,
and then people who want to directly make
[SPEAKER_03]: companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the end, the clubs are a bit like what
we talked about before, like the seed,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is, the clubs are like the natural
expression of self-organization,
[SPEAKER_03]: of collective consumption, in the measure
in which people have to resort to the
[SPEAKER_03]: black market, it is a natural movement
that people organize to feed on the
[SPEAKER_03]: substance, and it is true that in the last
20 years there has been a lot of fight and
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of dichotomy between the social
model and the more mercantile model,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it seems very interesting to me how the
Podemos law addresses it, because in the
[SPEAKER_03]: end positive and negative things have been
seen on both sides, and in fact,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, we have Barcelona,
which is like the new Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_03]: but in reality that fight that there was
between small and large clubs,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the reality is that we have a model
implemented in Barcelona with 250 clubs,
[SPEAKER_03]: probably there are about 200,000 people
who no longer supply themselves with the
[SPEAKER_03]: black market and who are going to these
clubs, and it is really a risk reduction
[SPEAKER_03]: tool that integrates the operation of the
social clubs, cooperativists and the
[SPEAKER_03]: mercantile clubs, so there is a lot of
chit-chat with the botpanel clubs,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the same with the issue of the Cañamo
flowers, as the government preventively
[SPEAKER_03]: said, given the experience of other
countries such as Switzerland or the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States, which the United States
regulated in 2018, and now you find the
[SPEAKER_03]: narcos cultivating 100 acres, where they
put the THC inside the Cañamo,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I think that preventively the
government said, what are we going to find
[SPEAKER_03]: now, 2000 hectares, we have no means to
control it, the most restrictive
[SPEAKER_03]: application, the plant is being inspected,
and then I do not care if there are stores
[SPEAKER_03]: that sell CBD flowers because they have
imported a product legally from another
[SPEAKER_03]: country in Europe and we are selling it
here, so it is a bit symptomatic of the
[SPEAKER_03]: contradictions when it comes to addressing
any aspect of regulation of this metaverse
[SPEAKER_03]: that we were talking about, and entering
the medical issue, I also consider that I
[SPEAKER_03]: think it is right, the fact of separating
it, I think that the medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is, it is something that if the
government of Spain has raised it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it is because they were the last on the
list, because they were having a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure on the whole issue of patients,
a phenomenal work that has been done by
[SPEAKER_03]: the Observatory and other collectives,
and that this has finally been proposed,
[SPEAKER_03]: because this has already started five
years ago, you make the first proposal of
[SPEAKER_03]: a subcommission on how to study,
how to approach access to medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, so with a lot of equidistance
and with a lot of agnosticity,
[SPEAKER_03]: if I see that at least there is a
subcommission proposal, that there is at
[SPEAKER_03]: least a majority that could approve those
conclusions and recommendations,
[SPEAKER_03]: which then the government would have to
see how it applies them, but I think it is
[SPEAKER_03]: very positive, just as in 2012 there was a
process in the Basque Parliament with the
[SPEAKER_03]: issue of the Clus, there was a debate in
depth on the matter, I find it very
[SPEAKER_03]: positive that now at least the politicians
go 25-30 people to explain that reality,
[SPEAKER_03]: sadly they are going to act in that
commission people with many interests and
[SPEAKER_03]: with different ways of seeing how to
access this, and then the complexity is
[SPEAKER_03]: brutal as to how to approach the issue of
medicinal cannabis, since there are
[SPEAKER_03]: already other examples from other
countries, so well, at least it is a way
[SPEAKER_03]: as we can, in the end it is like,
hey, we are going to approach it and we
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to study it, perhaps it is no
longer so important what is going to come
[SPEAKER_03]: out, because it is a long-term process,
but we already have a commission,
[SPEAKER_03]: we are going to have some conclusions this
year and some recommendations,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there we are going to see the
government and the bureaucracy of the
[SPEAKER_03]: government, the institutions, because many
times the government are politicians and
[SPEAKER_03]: they are allowed to advise, well,
National Drug Plan, which they have with
[SPEAKER_03]: the issue of cannabis abuse for 30 years
and in reality they do not continue to
[SPEAKER_03]: solve it, because those policies are not
effective and there is still consumption
[SPEAKER_03]: and abuse by vulnerable groups,
and then of course it is that it is on the
[SPEAKER_03]: subject of how that regulation is
addressed, then obviously the Spanish
[SPEAKER_03]: government needs an update of its
pharmacopeia, and then once they said,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, we are going to have a law on
medicinal cannabis, well, sadly,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, seeing how it has happened in other
countries and what it has cost them to
[SPEAKER_03]: implement, well, I have my doubts that the
government of Spain is able to implement a
[SPEAKER_03]: law on the subject of medicinal in an
effective way, because beyond the law then
[SPEAKER_03]: they begin to see as sub-layers of
debates, we authorize medicines or in the
[SPEAKER_03]: vision of the revision of the pharmacopeia
we accept master formulas that include
[SPEAKER_03]: oils and accept flowers, second level,
the people where it is going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: administered of medicinal cannabis in
normal pharmacies or only hospital
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmacies, next level, who is going to
recommend it, the doctor of the public
[SPEAKER_03]: security system or they are going to have
to prescribe private doctors, it will be
[SPEAKER_03]: essential that other treatments do not
have worked and then we supply cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: then the complexity is tremendous,
sadly it will cost, just like Germany
[SPEAKER_03]: after four years continues there with the
tremendous fight, but then there is
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously the industry that comes from
behind to satisfy those demands of the
[SPEAKER_03]: patients and how they are going to satisfy
it and how many similarities does that
[SPEAKER_03]: have with the sad pharmaceutical industry
and the health business, then there is
[SPEAKER_03]: also a lot of complexity in how it is
going to be addressed, but in any case I
[SPEAKER_03]: think it is positive that it is being done
in the work of civil society, very
[SPEAKER_03]: important, I know that there are also
collectives that are pressing with the
[SPEAKER_03]: issue of the possibility of
self-cultivation, which for that right now
[SPEAKER_03]: that will sound Chinese to them,
although in reality, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: prior to all these things that I have said
in its layers, there is therapeutic
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis or medicinal cannabis,
I am there a lot with Steve D'Angelo who
[SPEAKER_03]: promotes it, as a product of well-being,
then it has different layers of what it
[SPEAKER_03]: brings to therapeutic effects the plant,
then there will also be many levels,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it has put more for the
recreational model with medicine and in
[SPEAKER_03]: fact experiences like Canada have been
thrown 15 years with medicine or the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States, until they have said
recreational, Germany has been faster,
[SPEAKER_03]: it has said today in four years what we
need is recreational and in fact 60% of
[SPEAKER_03]: the people who access medicinal cannabis
have previous experiences of recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, the main company, Pedro Cane in
Holland, is lowering sales because people
[SPEAKER_03]: increasingly prefer to go to the coffee
shop, although it is not a standardized
[SPEAKER_03]: GMP product and everything you want,
but access more to the coffee shop than to
[SPEAKER_03]: the pharmaceutical products, then there is
a good discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think that in the end it is
something that cannot be stopped,
[SPEAKER_05]: the political inaction and the absence of
regulation and the fact that the pain of
[SPEAKER_05]: the patients can not wait has made that
the same, as we said before, seek life and
[SPEAKER_05]: have had to be supplied through clubs that
have lent them that support or through
[SPEAKER_05]: self-cultivation, which is a bit,
the patients who have also been able to do
[SPEAKER_05]: it and have had the ability to do it,
which are not all, it is evident that this
[SPEAKER_05]: sub-commission will not meet the
expectations already at the entrance of
[SPEAKER_05]: all these people, therefore I consider
that they should also add to the momentum
[SPEAKER_05]: of this initiative, because there it is
recognized the possibility of
[SPEAKER_05]: self-cultivation of the cooperative social
clubs, if, as ever, they will not be happy
[SPEAKER_05]: with that situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Speaking of self-cultivation, Sergio,
you, apart from managing a club,
[SPEAKER_05]: your passion is the self-cultivation of
cannabis, you have a lot of experience and
[SPEAKER_05]: well, I wanted you to make an assessment
of the terms in which self-cultivation is
[SPEAKER_05]: collected in the law.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before I want to make a small comment also
about what Iker has commented and what you
[SPEAKER_06]: have commented now about self-cultivation
and that you have to be a bit,
[SPEAKER_06]: that is, beyond the needs and the requests
that we have as a sector, which are many
[SPEAKER_06]: years in the dark and many things that we
want, you have to take into account that
[SPEAKER_06]: before asking for self-cultivation of
cannabis for medicinal cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: you will have to ask that the flower be
considered as medicine, to take it into
[SPEAKER_06]: account, okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like to cultivate, I don't like
to self-cultivate, I self-cultivate
[SPEAKER_06]: because I obviously cultivate and
cultivation is my passion, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: plant is my passion, I have left
everything for the cannabis plant and
[SPEAKER_06]: really the fact of having legal security
that supports you, which is not the same
[SPEAKER_06]: as the act of cultivation that you are
doing does not have a criminal
[SPEAKER_06]: transcendence, which is a concept that may
also be confused, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Many people believe that in Spain
self-cultivation is legal and that is a
[SPEAKER_06]: lie, it really does not have a criminal
transcendence, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you can confirm it as a lawyer,
but we do not have any legal security,
[SPEAKER_06]: okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: Your plants are seen, tomorrow they come
in, they intervene, they take them away,
[SPEAKER_06]: they judge you, they do not sanction you,
etc.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it is very important that the
fact that the law that regulates cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: in an integral way for adult use collects
that possibility and I also think that it
[SPEAKER_06]: attacks it from a very positive point of
view, because it forces you to be honest,
[SPEAKER_06]: it forces you to be honest, it gives you
some limitations that can obviously
[SPEAKER_06]: satisfy even the fiercest activist who in
no case would be able to allow that in a
[SPEAKER_06]: regulation there would not be three kilos
of marijuana a year, but it is also able
[SPEAKER_06]: to satisfy the person who needs to put
those two plants to do their annual
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivation management.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it is quite complete,
the fact that what is considered,
[SPEAKER_06]: whether the volume and not the area,
when calculating the space in which you
[SPEAKER_06]: can self-cultivate, I think it is also
quite important, for the same reason as
[SPEAKER_06]: before, because in the end it forces you
to be honest, you in four square meters
[SPEAKER_06]: you can cultivate a lot of cannabis,
a lot, but in eight cubic meters you can
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivate eight cubic meters of cannabis,
there is no more.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it is also important that the
regulation model proposed by the Unidas
[SPEAKER_06]: Podemos law, Proposition 420, is based on
honesty and within that honesty each of
[SPEAKER_06]: the points leads you to what it actually
is, that is, we cannot propose
[SPEAKER_06]: self-cultivation to cultivate 20 hectares,
it will not sound reasonable to anyone,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think that the proposal is very
appropriate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we are already close to running out
of time, I wanted to invite you all on
[SPEAKER_05]: Saturday at four thirty in the World
Cannabis Conference we are going to have
[SPEAKER_05]: the opportunity to have the
representatives of the political parties
[SPEAKER_05]: that have presented the different
initiatives in the Congress this year,
[SPEAKER_05]: Lucia Muñoz, Jorge Moruno and Carles
Castillo of Unidas Podemos, Más País and
[SPEAKER_05]: Esquerra Republicana, I will moderate a
panel with them and we will talk about the
[SPEAKER_05]: current context, the possibilities that
this comes forward and well, if you want
[SPEAKER_05]: to be interested in the law, SF Abogados
is the official office of Spannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: we will be in stand 221 of hall 3 and 266
of hall 4.
[SPEAKER_05]: And well, we are going to move on to
questions, to those of you who want to ask
[SPEAKER_05]: any, and then we will project the video of
the 420 movement that Sergio is leading to
[SPEAKER_05]: support this initiative.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thank you all for your attention and I
hope you enjoy it a lot at ICBC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much to the panelists,
a very interesting panel and now as a
[SPEAKER_01]: tradition on ICBC we give five minutes
time for questions from the audience,
[SPEAKER_01]: if there are any questions in English or
in Spanish, go ahead please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, hello colleagues, you already know
me, for those who do not know me,
[SPEAKER_02]: I am Patricia, I am the president of the
Canadian Association Federation here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Catalonia, you already know that I
disagree on some issues of the law,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is not a secret, so I am concerned
about several issues that you have
[SPEAKER_02]: commented, the first is, and you already
know it, the fact of assimilating,
[SPEAKER_02]: first, to eliminate the model of social
club of cannabis, as it is understood
[SPEAKER_02]: right now that it does have a place in the
present, what does not have a place is how
[SPEAKER_02]: it has surpassed the limits of the model
and that is what is currently being
[SPEAKER_02]: punished, so within that question I think
that for me, it seems very good to me that
[SPEAKER_02]: there is a decent way out for the people
who have abused the model, but I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that there also has to be recognition of
the people who have been working for a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time because this model works and
because it really is a model that
[SPEAKER_02]: currently does have a place, for example,
with the 2030 agenda, it is a model of
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainable community, of proximity trade,
so it gives me the feeling that in the end
[SPEAKER_02]: we are validating through that law a
series of practices that have perhaps come
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the limits that were established
and that in the end the people that we
[SPEAKER_02]: defended, a model that can continue to be
in force and that is not obsolete,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is my opinion of course, in the end
disappears and dissipates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so why that need to validate that
more business part and not allow that
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis social clubs continue as
activists as they have worked so far?
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not agree, the truth is that the
cooperative social club model allows
[SPEAKER_05]: perfectly the activities of the classic
model, in fact it is based on the codes of
[SPEAKER_05]: good practices and the functioning it has,
and I would ask you a question,
[SPEAKER_05]: Patti, what would you do with the clubs
that do not work as such?
[SPEAKER_05]: We close them all, what alternative do you
propose for them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we leave them out of regulation and
only those who are forced to function in a
[SPEAKER_05]: cooperative way work?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your proposal for these entities?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can answer you too, because a
tremendous debate could be entered,
[SPEAKER_03]: but sometimes, as I saw in Congress,
there are also discrepancies and I think
[SPEAKER_03]: they are super secondary, I am going to
tell you why, first, because the
[SPEAKER_03]: possibility that this law comes out is
less than 1%, that is the first thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: one, we would have to abolish the
monarchy, as my friend Roberto says,
[SPEAKER_03]: and put a republic and that we had the
capacity, but it is very symptomatic the
[SPEAKER_03]: monarchy, what it represents, because it
is the monarchy, it is the church,
[SPEAKER_03]: it is the conservative judges,
it is all the extreme right that is in
[SPEAKER_03]: this country, it is the national plan,
it is the national drug plan, the MPS,
[SPEAKER_03]: then what to say, the fact that now it has
been put in this law, that it may be that
[SPEAKER_03]: there are amatizations, I also agree with
you that it should be recognized,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is secondary, the important thing is
that there is a legislative proposal and
[SPEAKER_03]: that is going to open a brutal debate,
and from there we can discuss many more
[SPEAKER_03]: things, but right now we are very far
away, and what happens to us?
[SPEAKER_03]: Also to the associative movement,
my club, although I am already a little
[SPEAKER_03]: out, but we suffer from oblivion,
because you know, it is one of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: since I have been in the movement that I
have traveled, I have seen other
[SPEAKER_03]: experiences, other models, and that is,
there is a universe of people and
[SPEAKER_03]: proposals out there, and sometimes we are
so endogamous for the repression that has
[SPEAKER_03]: happened and the clandestinity in which
the activities must be developed that we
[SPEAKER_03]: do not look outside, but I can tell you
that right now it is almost irrelevant,
[SPEAKER_03]: although it is important and it is
fundamental what you are proposing to the
[SPEAKER_03]: effects of the law is to open the debate,
which is the important thing here,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there are many things to discuss,
and unfortunately the allies of Podemos do
[SPEAKER_03]: not agree to regulate the recreational,
because they are more than on the left,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the center right, so you have to see
the context too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also I, to add one very brief thing,
that I consider that we are a sector that
[SPEAKER_06]: we are already very accustomed and very
touched, because they judge us constantly,
[SPEAKER_06]: and that perhaps we should consider that
the egos do not have to cloud the fact
[SPEAKER_06]: that we are judging each other and that we
are really companions and that we have to
[SPEAKER_06]: have the capacity, just like different
proposals that have been developed in
[SPEAKER_06]: recent years, and that all the people have
supported, that if we really have
[SPEAKER_06]: companions who have managed to advance in
a direction that has not been achieved so
[SPEAKER_06]: far, that we also have the capacity to
support, simply that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I also as a final, that we support
each other, it is true that there are
[SPEAKER_04]: nuances, but this proposal is very
interesting, and in some way I think that
[SPEAKER_04]: in the end it encompasses us, the
associations are there, we try to join
[SPEAKER_04]: forces and look for the positive,
not like the sketches, as a change of
[SPEAKER_04]: social model and of law that can really
change the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can talk extensively, but I think
the interesting thing is that we join
[SPEAKER_04]: together, and we give the strength that we
have together so that this is carried out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the law is improveable,
I think that having this debate in a
[SPEAKER_05]: direct way has never been done,
I think it was the time to do it,
[SPEAKER_05]: and in the end I think that the important
thing is that the law can pass the
[SPEAKER_05]: takeover, any of the two that are still
pending, and then the commission that is
[SPEAKER_05]: created, hopefully it will be like that,
then the amendments and improvements will
[SPEAKER_05]: be presented, and I am sure that we will
agree, because we have all been suffering
[SPEAKER_05]: for many years, and I think it is our
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the only thing I offer is total
predisposition, joint work, to have
[SPEAKER_05]: something that pleases all of us,
but to all of us, not just one party.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much to all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for our panelists one more
time, that was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you very much.
