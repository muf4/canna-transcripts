[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's about two years ago that
everybody was talking about the big CPG
[SPEAKER_07]: companies entering the space and they're
going through Canada and they figure out
[SPEAKER_07]: how to get in the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was really less than a year ago
that one of the Canadian companies bought
[SPEAKER_07]: one of the larger, or didn't buy,
they tied up one of the larger American
[SPEAKER_07]: companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now the M&A environment is totally
flipped, 180, we're not gonna probably be
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about good stuff in M&A,
it's more of the nightmares.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm really happy to have with me today
on the panel, some of these are last
[SPEAKER_07]: minute, if you're looking in your book,
that is not Kim Rivers, it's Emily Paxia
[SPEAKER_07]: of Poseidon here in San Francisco,
Eric Kaufman of Dama Financial,
[SPEAKER_07]: he's based out of Los Angeles,
Katie Young, she's the managing partner at
[SPEAKER_07]: Ad Astra Law Firm here in San Francisco,
and Brent Johnson from Hoban Law Firm in
[SPEAKER_07]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna let everybody just briefly share
their own background and then we'll get
[SPEAKER_07]: started and we'll start with you,
Emily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody, Alan Brockstein was somebody
that when we first got into the space was
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of like a rock star.
[SPEAKER_04]: We used to listen to his podcast every
week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, it's neat to be still here with
him seven years later, almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, my name is Emily Paxia,
co-founder, managing partner of Poseidon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have two investment funds dedicated to
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We launched our first fund in January of
2014 alongside the opening of the Colorado
[SPEAKER_04]: adult use market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been an incredible experience
from that point forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've invested in the US, Canada,
Europe, Mexico, and Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we launched our second fund in
September of 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: That fund is very focused on just series A
or later stage private companies,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was kind of where we noticed a gap
in the funding space when everyone was,
[SPEAKER_04]: to Alan's point earlier, just kind of
focusing on this RTO IPO process in the
[SPEAKER_04]: MSO category.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we always have found that we do
really well when we place investments
[SPEAKER_04]: where the crowds aren't running.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's our second fund.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Eric Kaufman, chief revenue officer of
Dama Financial.
[SPEAKER_01]: By way of background, Dama provides the
critical financial infrastructure that the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry needs to be able to operate just
like it were a non-cannabis-related
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two co-founders come from banking and
payments backgrounds, two companies public
[SPEAKER_01]: in that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the important thing to note is that
one of the fundamental value propositions
[SPEAKER_01]: of both of those companies was moving a
cash-based economy to a banked and digital
[SPEAKER_01]: economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we set out to do was provide
them a solution to the most pressing need,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was a bank account, which we've
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've continued to bolt on a whole
suite of products and services,
[SPEAKER_01]: including interest-bearing account,
escrow account, bill pay by check,
[SPEAKER_01]: ACH, or wire, armor, car, cash,
pickup and processing, merchant
[SPEAKER_01]: processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're powering the back end of Helix
Exchange, which is a cannabis commodities
[SPEAKER_01]: trading platform, and continue to add on
products and services.
[SPEAKER_01]: So excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Katie Young.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am the co-founder and now managing
partner of Ad Astra Law Group in San
[SPEAKER_05]: Francisco.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are fighters, not lovers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We handle business, employment,
real estate, and IP litigation for
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have to hire me, you're having a
bad time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm here to talk to you today about
what I see from the civil litigator angle
[SPEAKER_05]: and can tell you some real horror stories
about failed M&A transactions and what to
[SPEAKER_05]: look at.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am also the president of the
International Cannabis Bar Association for
[SPEAKER_05]: the attorneys in the room, canbar.org.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are the only bar association that
supports attorneys servicing the business
[SPEAKER_05]: needs of cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, Katie Young, Ad Astra Law Group.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm super excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all my esteemed panelists,
great to be amongst experts in the field.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Brent Johnson, CEO of Hoban Law Group.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the leading global law firm 100%
committed to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have about 50 attorneys headquartered
in Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: We cover 28 states.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a handful of attorneys in Latin
America.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in Israel and soon to be in Europe
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We cover basically anything a business
needs from a startup to M&A standpoint or
[SPEAKER_06]: financing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do corporate securities, mergers
acquisitions, private equity, venture
[SPEAKER_06]: capital.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do fund formation, intellectual
property, real estate, employment,
[SPEAKER_06]: litigation, tax, and I'm sure I'm
forgetting a few, but anything you might
[SPEAKER_06]: need from start to finish, we got that
covered.
[SPEAKER_06]: Personally, although I'm a lawyer,
I have a finance background as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I started my career in Silicon Valley 20
years ago doing startup work, venture
[SPEAKER_06]: capital financing, fund formation,
mergers, acquisitions, securities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Came back to Denver in 2003, worked for a
large law firm there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was associate general counsel at Quiznos
during their big growth days.
[SPEAKER_06]: We exited Quiznos at one and a half
billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a private equity exit to JP Morgan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Left there, ran a couple startups,
had those exits, ran a $65 million private
[SPEAKER_06]: equity fund for about three years till we
sold off that portfolio.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I came to the cannabis space because
I came in as an investor because there's
[SPEAKER_06]: obviously tons of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I ran into Bob Hoeven and he sucked
me into Hoeven Law Group, but it's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've grown the firm and we've more than
doubled over two years and it's great to
[SPEAKER_06]: be part of literally one of the leading
global law firms that's 100% committed to
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hemp too, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And hemp too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and hemp as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're about 50% marijuana, 50% hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to start with you, Emily,
because I know you have the right
[SPEAKER_07]: perspective here about the before and the
after, but how have things been changing
[SPEAKER_07]: from your perspective when it comes to M
&A?
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole industry has been going through
a few cycles and it really depends on a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a catalyst driven industry for
sure and the way that capital flows on the
[SPEAKER_04]: back end of a catalyst, it's really
interesting to observe and it's important
[SPEAKER_04]: to consider.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first wave of M&A that we were seeing
really take place last year, or was it,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, about last year, we were seeing MSOs
purchasing product companies was a big
[SPEAKER_04]: one, I would say.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that time, capital was flowing very
well into that space because people
[SPEAKER_04]: perceived it to be a liquid space and that
there is a premium for liquidity a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: the time in this, especially when you're
talking about people who are thinking
[SPEAKER_04]: about how do I maximize a return in a
short period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we saw some of the acquisitions going
on with some of those product companies
[SPEAKER_04]: that I would consider to be at pretty
frothy valuations, pretty high multiples.
[SPEAKER_04]: Traditionally speaking, branded products
don't command a very high multiple,
[SPEAKER_04]: but in these instances, it was kind of a
land grab and people were doing it and it
[SPEAKER_04]: was driving stock prices up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an opportunity to really create
more attention around the companies and so
[SPEAKER_04]: that was really driving it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what we saw was what we call it
kind of the Darwin phase or the reckoning
[SPEAKER_04]: where people are starting to actually pay
attention to business fundamentals,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you can imagine that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thinking about things like revenue,
growth of revenue, EBITDA, all of these
[SPEAKER_04]: factors that really indicate the health of
a business, not just a press piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that point, we started to see more
scrutiny about what people were paying for
[SPEAKER_04]: these companies and the way that these
mergers were occurring or these
[SPEAKER_04]: acquisitions were occurring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now it's a different time where
we're seeing the multiples come way,
[SPEAKER_04]: way down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing mergers starting to happen
because it's basically too many people
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to do the same thing in the same
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a lot of people are trying to think
about how do we go through a one plus one
[SPEAKER_04]: equals three scenario where we can come
together, consolidate and streamline our
[SPEAKER_04]: operations and then drive revenue growth
more in an exponential way rather than
[SPEAKER_04]: just incremental bumps.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say that we moved from a point
of exuberance where it was driving a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of attention, driving a lot of excitement
to now it's almost like a survival part of
[SPEAKER_04]: the M&A space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is a critical piece to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing we're watching for is that,
let's face it, in every maturation of an
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, not everybody is gonna make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Failures of startups are astronomical in
every single sector that you look at
[SPEAKER_04]: historically speaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some companies are not going to make it
through this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a little bit worried that we're
kind of pushing things together without
[SPEAKER_04]: contemplating the true upside or accretive
value of that just to keep some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: companies alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we just have to go through the
painful process of some of them can't make
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want to see the M&A process
just kind of carrying dead weight through
[SPEAKER_04]: into the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Eric, you talk to people all over the
country.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your take on what's going on in M
&A right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I echo the same sentiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's not just the exuberance but
the irrational exuberance has kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: dried up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people were, we called it dumb
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we're not directly involved in
the M&A, I think we're a little bit ahead
[SPEAKER_01]: of the curve in seeing what's coming down
the pike because we're banking the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see when funds go up or down or
who's being paid or isn't being paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get to see some of these trends
before they necessarily rear their head to
[SPEAKER_01]: the masses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I also think not just on the investment
side, but you saw a lot of businesses get
[SPEAKER_01]: out over their skis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making money hand over fist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really tired of dealing with a
distributor or something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get into distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a distribution license.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get into distribution without
realizing that it's a fundamentally
[SPEAKER_01]: different business and you don't hire or
bring on anybody that's got experience in
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that distribution company
actually sinks the golden goose,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people kind of trying to get into every
vertical, not fully appreciating that they
[SPEAKER_01]: are very different businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: Katie, I'm going to come right back to
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, Brent, can you talk about how
things have changed from your perspective,
[SPEAKER_07]: the deals that you've seen at Hoban in
terms of the amount of cash going into
[SPEAKER_07]: deals or anything like that that would
have changed over the last year or two?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a couple general trends that we've
seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at the number of deals that
happened 2018 over 2019, I think there was
[SPEAKER_06]: a roughly about 250 deals, M&A deals that
were closed in 2018.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's up to about 300 in 2019.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interestingly enough, cultivation retail
accounted for about 50% of those deals,
[SPEAKER_06]: which actually kind of makes sense because
those are the areas of the market that are
[SPEAKER_06]: getting most affected by lack of capital
and regulatory uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so those are kind of the bargain
companies right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And another key point is that probably
about two-thirds of the deals that are
[SPEAKER_06]: getting done are getting done by public
companies that are acquiring companies as
[SPEAKER_06]: opposed to private deals.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we focus primarily on private deals
and we're seeing definitely the deals are
[SPEAKER_06]: getting challenging.
[SPEAKER_06]: Valuations are getting challenging.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're seeing a lot of companies that just,
you know, they weren't set up correctly.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't have adequate capital.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they're effectively, you know,
they're distressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they're not in the best,
you know, bargaining position.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, deal size, you know,
we're certainly seeing an increase in deal
[SPEAKER_06]: size.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, probably our average deal size
is probably, you know, probably two years
[SPEAKER_06]: ago it was in the, you know, the $5 to $15
million range.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're seeing them in anywhere from
probably the $10 to $35 million range.
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely seeing an increase in deal
size.
[SPEAKER_06]: But everything seems to be on pause.
[SPEAKER_06]: Q4 definitely slowed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everyone is just trying to figure
out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I do think that 2020 at some
point in time we'll see increased M&A
[SPEAKER_06]: activity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last point that I'll make is with the
legality of hemp now, we're definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: seeing more activity on the hemp side in
terms of, you know, folks buying up
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivation centers to grow hemp,
farmland, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Katie, you already warned us that you
have nothing but bad news to share.
[SPEAKER_07]: But can you tell us kind of how much your
business is picking up from failed M&A,
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really sick business development,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, whereas Eric's on the front
end and seeing, you know, the trouble
[SPEAKER_05]: brewing early on, I am on the way back end
dealing with, let's say, even a very well
[SPEAKER_05]: formulated M&A transaction where,
you know, some months later, a year later,
[SPEAKER_05]: it needs to be unwound because same
reasons we found heard here, right,
[SPEAKER_05]: that they didn't look into it well enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see a lot of fights amongst just
personality disputes amongst the owners.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, these are the sort of like soft
things that can't be measured by,
[SPEAKER_05]: for instance, you know, the lawyer running
the numbers, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's totally different.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my business is unfortunately quite
busy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just telling these guys in the
green room, I'm having trouble keeping up
[SPEAKER_05]: with the demand, which is really sad.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, for a lot of these
companies, you know, they do kind of just
[SPEAKER_05]: need to go away.
[SPEAKER_05]: But instead of doing so, they're,
you know, the distressed asset trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: find someone to come and, you know,
absorb them and pick them up and make it
[SPEAKER_05]: work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it's sometimes just bad
business tactics at the front.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lack of understanding of how much the tax
burden from 280E is going to affect you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All across the board, there's,
I mean, I've seen all the different
[SPEAKER_05]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are losing their dreams.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're losing their hard work.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they hire the wrong lawyer and they
don't negotiate well enough or they don't
[SPEAKER_05]: understand the transaction, they end up
really surprised later.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not a reason to undo a
contract.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that doesn't mean people don't try.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Emily, if we had been sitting here a
year ago, we probably would have been
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about all the out of state
operators publicly traded, especially that
[SPEAKER_07]: we're looking to buy California companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure there's not you're here in
the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what's going on there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's your outlook for the exit
strategy for I'm sure some of the people
[SPEAKER_07]: in the room here in terms of that exit
strategy in terms of exiting through an
[SPEAKER_04]: acquisition by MSO?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think that that's still an
opportunity that comes down the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think California has got a ways to go to
get sorted.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really hard to be an operator here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think egregiously so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think many of the people in this market
have been in it longer than anybody in the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry has been in it because of the
nature of how long we've had regulations
[SPEAKER_04]: around cannabis in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they looked, these businesses looked
very different once upon a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's been so incredibly difficult and
the taxes are so incredibly challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you had all these resources
pushing people into the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is basically the biggest competitor
for a regulated business.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, it's just unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I do think there are good
operators here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the operators here actually
have become the smartest and the leanest
[SPEAKER_04]: and they know how to compete in one of the
most competitive and longest running
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis markets in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so therefore, I think that once
California gets sorted out, there are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be incredibly attractive business
opportunities here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think an MSO should constantly be
keeping an eye on this market because who
[SPEAKER_04]: would not want to have a toehold in the
cradle of the Emerald Triangle or the
[SPEAKER_04]: cradle of the breadbasket and the
winebasket and all of the wonderful things
[SPEAKER_04]: we have here in California, including the
heart of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that, I do think that's
coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to take a little bit
more time.
[SPEAKER_04]: MSOs are definitely focusing on EBITDA
positive businesses and rightfully so
[SPEAKER_04]: because they've got enough on their plate
in these limited license markets where
[SPEAKER_04]: many of them are focused.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think that when they can look to
these Californians and California
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses, they're going to see some of
the most attractive businesses in the
[SPEAKER_04]: entire world.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, I would also say that some of the
MSOs are finding talent from some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: California businesses because of the
challenges they face in operating.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can take that into basically an
oligopoly market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Limited license is easier to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Limited license, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to mix it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they, I mean, then you can really,
you can make it rain because you knew what
[SPEAKER_04]: it was like to compete against 750 illegal
stores in the Los Angeles market and still
[SPEAKER_04]: make money doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my favorite tweets this year was
somebody was like, how did we take
[SPEAKER_04]: something that inherently made money and
we managed to all start losing money doing
[SPEAKER_04]: it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Selling cannabis, people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel like there's something to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so I'm still very optimistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we, when we formed our fund,
we did not form it in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was the popular concept at the time
because Colorado was where the legal adult
[SPEAKER_04]: market was.
[SPEAKER_04]: We formed it in California because to me,
California still is the future of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the history and the future of this
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is optimistic.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you're saying is keep your nose to
the grindstone.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cycle will turn and you'll be able to
do your deal in the future.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if not, just go work for one of these
guys and move out to, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_07]: Virginia or wherever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Focus, focus, focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'd have to be an optimist to be in
this industry for this long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mind if I just add?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think you touched on a good
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unfortunately we're having a very
painful right sizing of the market,
[SPEAKER_01]: a necessary evil, painful nonetheless,
but anybody that's still in this space is
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't figure out how to be here and
still be here and not be incredibly savvy
[SPEAKER_01]: and smart about your business because it
is incredibly difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's why those MSOs are
picking off people and bringing them on
[SPEAKER_01]: board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will just say from a positive
outlook, we're seeing an improvement in
[SPEAKER_01]: applicants for accounts, meaning we have a
very thorough due diligence process when
[SPEAKER_01]: we onboard somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: The businesses are better structured.
[SPEAKER_01]: The paperwork's more in order.
[SPEAKER_01]: The process is going faster and faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's been, and you see it
month on month, the improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think businesses are getting better
at the outset than they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're catching them and they probably
started several years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we are seeing an improvement,
which is a positive change.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that in California or is that across
the country?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to think of each state as its own
country, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because unfortunately, in my experience,
we haven't seen states learn best
[SPEAKER_01]: practices from other states necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of go do it on their own,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go into Michigan, there's a big
learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of that's natural, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just opening their businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't necessarily, at least from our
perspective, appreciate how difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: banking's going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's legal in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could get a bank account.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of see a pretty steep learning
curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitively, in California,
we're seeing an improvement.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then so to avoid having to see Katie,
what are you advising your clients to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are some of the smart things to do on
the front end?
[SPEAKER_06]: So one comment on the previous topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: It used to be a couple years ago,
if you just had assets, you could attract
[SPEAKER_06]: capital and maybe even have an early exit
if you had some licenses, you had some
[SPEAKER_06]: real estate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those days are over.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to actually have a business.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fundamentals matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have a strong management team.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to know how to run your business
efficiently, how to use capital
[SPEAKER_06]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like a startup company 101,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, actually have all the fundamentals
that you need to actually run a business.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things to avoid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's things that I've seen that
are problematic is everyone wants to get a
[SPEAKER_06]: deal done by tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they don't spend time on diligence.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't understand the management team.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't do all the background stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, from a diligence standpoint,
and I can go into a lot of details,
[SPEAKER_06]: but a lot of companies just don't have all
their ducks in a row.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, your ownership structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have documentation for everybody
that actually owns a piece of your
[SPEAKER_06]: business?
[SPEAKER_06]: We see it all the time where they would go
to do a deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it turns out that somebody put 100K
in two years ago, but they never got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They never had a contract.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't know the terms.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had issues come up where they say,
well, I want 5%.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was supposed to be two years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now more money has come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So 5% is now 2%, but they still want 5%.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no documentation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have issues where they haven't done
their securities filings.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have issues where they don't have
contracts with their employees.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have issues where they don't have
documented supplier contracts or
[SPEAKER_06]: distribution contracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So across the board, we have issues where
they haven't properly done renewals.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess long story short, get good
counsel, get good advisors, get everything
[SPEAKER_06]: papered up, get all your ducks in a row,
because not only will that keep you out of
[SPEAKER_06]: trouble, but that also is going to help
you sell your company for a higher value.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have anything to add to that,
Katie, to avoid seeing you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: All those things that you listed are a
really great way to end up hiring me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just very sad.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see a lot of what I call producer
situations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back to the story about the
producers, those folks who were promised
[SPEAKER_05]: 5% and it wasn't papered a couple years
ago, and now all of a sudden they heard
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a big merger coming up,
and they think they're going to get paid
[SPEAKER_05]: out, and they come out with their hand
out, and there's been 120% of the interest
[SPEAKER_05]: pledged to people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that is going to cause lots of
problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably going to tank your intended
merger or acquisition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Disclosing what's going on with your
company is the best idea, even if it tanks
[SPEAKER_05]: your intended transaction, because if you
don't, don't say that, oh, by the way,
[SPEAKER_05]: this guy out here is saying that I
promised him 10% a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't mind him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put the risk on the acquirer, your
co-party to contract.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them know what's going on,
the good, the bad, the ugly, all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them make the decision, and let them
walk away.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's better than getting sued later,
don't you think?
[SPEAKER_07]: Emily, you were involved with a special
purpose acquisition corporation,
[SPEAKER_07]: ImTech, that bought MJ Free.
[SPEAKER_07]: You went for UA and went public.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen a few other of these SPACs,
and I'm just wondering if you think this
[SPEAKER_07]: is a positive for the industry,
and will these be ways to consolidate?
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been talking a lot about cultivation
in retail, but on the ancillary side,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is where they're going to be
limited, the ones in the US, is this a
[SPEAKER_07]: positive in your mind or a negative?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting how we went from this
rush to the RTOs, and now I feel like it's
[SPEAKER_04]: raining SPACs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having participated in really one of the
very first SPACs in the industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was a very, very good idea,
and for the following reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was allowing ancillary companies to
gain access to the capital markets in a
[SPEAKER_04]: way that could create momentum behind an
ancillary company and push it to the next
[SPEAKER_04]: level.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that point, there was only really the
OTC markets available in the US,
[SPEAKER_04]: so this was like a real opportunity to get
on the NASDAQ, and that creates a whole
[SPEAKER_04]: new access point in terms of analyst
coverage, in terms of the institutional
[SPEAKER_04]: involvement, all of those things that can
make for a really positive result.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know now it seems as though we can't
swing a stick without hitting a SPAC in
[SPEAKER_04]: the US, and it's great in many ways,
because again, it could create some
[SPEAKER_04]: velocity around capital flows within the
United States towards these ancillary
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses, which we've been a big fan of
ancillary investing since the beginning of
[SPEAKER_04]: our fund.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, that's how we started,
because we weren't sure how investors
[SPEAKER_04]: would respond to plant-touching investing,
so we started with a lot of tech and
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture tech solutions to try to
improve the efficiency of grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do see a place for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have seen that it can struggle to find
the right opportunity to invest,
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot of the ancillary companies,
like in our portfolio, we're grooming
[SPEAKER_04]: them, we're waiting for them to be able to
actually just IPO, just do a direct IPO,
[SPEAKER_04]: either a direct listing or an IPO process
on the NASDAQ or the New York Stock
[SPEAKER_04]: Exchange.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're patient capital, so we're willing to
wait a few years for that to happen,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if a company is looking to go... I've
seen a couple of tech plays, like M-Tech
[SPEAKER_04]: is a perfect example of this, which then
became Kern or Akerna, which was the seed
[SPEAKER_04]: of that, I would say, was MJ Freeway,
and now they're looking to acquire other
[SPEAKER_04]: tech companies to create this
tech-consolidated approach suite of
[SPEAKER_04]: products for the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could see how that works, because when
it comes to M&A, if you're a public
[SPEAKER_04]: company, you have different currencies to
play with.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other words, you have stock that you
can really use to drive the transaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have to just be cash,
or it's not just private stock
[SPEAKER_04]: transaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a little bit more in terms of the
heft of the currency available,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you can also probably access capital
more quickly if you need to do a raise to
[SPEAKER_04]: buy something out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are certain benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't say it's the Holy Grail,
but I think it was a very... In knowing
[SPEAKER_04]: the guys that put together that first
SPAC, I got to understand where they were
[SPEAKER_04]: going with it, and I thought it was a very
smart way to approach a
[SPEAKER_04]: capital-constrained industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: To try to create more access points.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that makes me crazy about this
industry is that because of the way the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations are, we can only accept
accredited investors into our funds,
[SPEAKER_04]: or even higher than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that democratization of access to
investing into high-growth industries is
[SPEAKER_04]: important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that having it listed on these
exchanges like the NASDAQ, where the
[SPEAKER_04]: reporting requirements are more strict,
I feel like it provides a little bit more
[SPEAKER_04]: safety around those investment
opportunities for non-accredited investors
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to participate in an industry
like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eric, I think you work mainly with
plant-touching companies, but do you have
[SPEAKER_07]: a view on the ancillary space and M&A that
might be going on there now or in the
[SPEAKER_07]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll work with anybody, whether it's a
cultivator, distributor, manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_01]: retailer, home delivery, a jar
manufacturer that sells a portion of their
[SPEAKER_01]: jars to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually seeing a lot of those
ancillary businesses that a portion of
[SPEAKER_01]: their business is cannabis-related,
because they received a check from a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis company, put it in their B of A
account, and they got the corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: account shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they're going to have a cannabis
part of their business, they're opening up
[SPEAKER_01]: separate accounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're seeing a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think specifically on the M&A side,
what we're seeing is, and this is just
[SPEAKER_01]: anecdotally, that people are moving away
from the quote-unquote sexier side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: business, or the consumer-facing side of
the business, and are looking more at the
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure side of the business,
because that's really what's missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Distribution, financial, whatever it may
be, it's the infrastructure to support the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that really needs to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as companies do these call them
roll-ups or consolidations, I do think
[SPEAKER_01]: people are getting a little more diligent
in defining what is a fit for their
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy to get style drift and get
excited and buy something because you
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you realize, wow, that's not
really our business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounded good or it looked good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can easily convince yourself that
it's part of your core business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people are taking a deep
breath and stepping back and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, does this really make sense?
[SPEAKER_07]: Brent, separate from cannabis and the hemp
side, is that a down cycle like we're
[SPEAKER_07]: seeing in cannabis when it comes to M&A
because of the federal uncertainty?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything specific to hemp right
now that you all are seeing?
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the hemp side, we see huge
opportunity on the hemp side.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I assume everybody in here knows the
difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: The interesting thing about hemp,
it's now fully legal at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it arguably has 50,000 industrial
uses, so more than just hemp-derived CBD
[SPEAKER_06]: or CBD-related products.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are truly many other plastic
bottles and batteries and car doors and
[SPEAKER_06]: houses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're definitely all in on hemp,
and we're making sure our clients
[SPEAKER_06]: understand that there's huge opportunity
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marijuana is always going to be there,
but it's got its medical uses.
[SPEAKER_06]: People use it to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's all just going to be that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hemp's huge, and we're definitely seeing
people wanting to grow more hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: More states are adopting their plans under
the new USDA regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so our business probably two or three
years ago was probably 70%, 75% marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: and maybe 20%, 25% hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's half and half.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I suspect in two years from now,
it'll probably be 70%, 70%, 75% hemp and
[SPEAKER_06]: 20%, 25% marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to ask a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody sitting on the sidelines right
now waiting for the FDA to ultimately
[SPEAKER_07]: weigh in on CBD, do you see pent-up demand
for more consolidation when that happens?
[SPEAKER_06]: With regard to the FDA, that's not going
to get resolved anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's one of those things where
folks are cautious, but a lot of it's just
[SPEAKER_06]: education.
[SPEAKER_06]: Educating our clients that, yeah,
there is this FDA issue, but compared to
[SPEAKER_06]: marijuana, there's a lot less risk in
terms of hemp-derived products.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really just related to CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: Think outside the box.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many other things that hemp's
going to be used to get turned into.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also all the other parts of it,
all the genetics and all the technology
[SPEAKER_06]: around.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you grow it efficiently?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you process it efficiently?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you efficiently make it into
batteries and bottles and cars and plants
[SPEAKER_06]: and all that, or in houses?
[SPEAKER_06]: So people think of hemp as CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hemp is so much larger than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so definitely think outside the box
and also look at all the stuff that's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be needed to be developed in
terms of processing hemp and turning it
[SPEAKER_06]: into products and scaling.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to give the audience an
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any questions in the audience?
If you have a question, raise your hand.
Let's hear it again for the panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have more questions if you don't,
but I wanted to make sure if anybody had
[SPEAKER_07]: questions for the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's got a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I see?
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are all incredibly well-informed,
apparently, having all the knowledge you
[SPEAKER_02]: need.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw a small hand wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like an auction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be very on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very subtle, like an upper-class
auction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I don't get the $100,000 bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I did not hear and
one of the things that I still think that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're missing in the industry as a whole,
when we talk about risk and risk aversion
[SPEAKER_00]: and we talk about insurance and yes,
they have been providing business
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions and such, but they're finally
really starting to look at the industry as
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those of us that have been doing this
for a while, I think that there's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to bring that group along and
not just in the investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you can talk a little bit about
avoiding exposure and product liability
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of the other things that are
already affecting us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like a lawyer question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to rephrase it so that he can
answer it?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little hard to hear you,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about the financial part of this,
but we're not talking about the backend
[SPEAKER_00]: side of this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is probably to Katie a lot
because you're probably dealing with some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think we see the whole vape
gate and what we learned from unregulated,
[SPEAKER_00]: unlicensed areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one way I would answer that would be to
make sure that you are surrounding
[SPEAKER_05]: yourself with the experts who know what
they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means almost endless
specialization, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're concerned about your product
liability, which you should be,
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone should be, everyone in the supply
chain, make sure that you are going to
[SPEAKER_05]: someone and go retain a lawyer who is a
product liability specialist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not go to the criminal defense attorney
that kept you out of jail in the 90s,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very happy with him, but it's like
asking a podiatrist to do heart surgery,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way that I see that people have the
best luck controlling their risk is when
[SPEAKER_05]: they're seeking out and spending the money
on the real professionals who know what's
[SPEAKER_05]: going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, we were joking about this in
the green room earlier, but it's so much
[SPEAKER_05]: cheaper to hire someone who's a specialist
at the front end than it is to hire a
[SPEAKER_05]: litigator afterwards, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really like do not be penny wise
and pound foolish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really look into your risk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be very honest with yourself about where
it is and listen to your advisors about
[SPEAKER_05]: who else you might need to go look
towards.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one of the biggest mistakes that
I see people doing is that they rely on
[SPEAKER_05]: one lawyer for everything or one
consultant for everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that doesn't work in any other
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would that work here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, thank you panelists.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Helene Servillon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a partner at Journey One.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do early stage cannabis investments.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question was around, there's two parts
to the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: What industries outside of cannabis are
you guys most intrigued or excited about
[SPEAKER_03]: that you think will start to tip into near
future M&A?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second part is if those
industries, i.e.
[SPEAKER_03]: big alcohol, would it be through an
investment to an MSO like Canopy and then
[SPEAKER_03]: an acquisition from Canopy or direct M&A?
[SPEAKER_07]: Emily, that sounds up your alley.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first part of the question is what
other industries am I interested in
[SPEAKER_04]: investing in?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that are signaling near future M&A.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, like food and beverage
with CBD specifically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, they're all over the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say food and beverage or
traditional consumer packaged goods
[SPEAKER_04]: companies are all over this industry
already.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're already talking to companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're already looking at them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I'm a little, I'm not even sure
that it's going to be M&A and not build
[SPEAKER_04]: your own product in many of those cases
because we have yet to see breakaway
[SPEAKER_04]: brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some brands that are bigger in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But from my background, I used to consult
for PepsiCo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I understand the way these groups
think about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of market research and
understanding that goes into new product
[SPEAKER_04]: development and launching these products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's a low moat around it,
they're just going to do it themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so right now, I feel like CBD would be
falling right into that category.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm probably one of the more
skeptical people that acquisitions of high
[SPEAKER_04]: multiples of CBD brands are going to
happen from traditional CPG companies or
[SPEAKER_04]: even alcohol brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that from what I understand,
Constellation kind of regrets the way that
[SPEAKER_04]: they invested into Canopy Growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Corporation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that they've been pretty vocal
about their disappointment in the
[SPEAKER_04]: performance and the lagging of the
launching of beverages.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that we've got some pain
points to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think we're going to see those
lofty multiples for a while again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that when some of the regulations
change around banking and when things open
[SPEAKER_04]: up a bit more and things get of size,
we could see some more interest around
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think that it's, so I know beauty
brands, like I know L'Oreal's looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that alcohol's looking at the
space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know consumer packaged goods companies
are looking at the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Big Tobacco's looking at the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of them are investigating it and all
of them are trying to decide if they just
[SPEAKER_04]: do it themselves or if they buy companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to be slow until the FDA
weighs in too on CBD probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it depends on where they're located
too in terms of testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did anybody else have anything to add to
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just say that I think it's kind of
interesting because some people or a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of people think that cannabis is like this
really, really different thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to be treated differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's some legality and
regulatory hurdles, but it's a plant,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's going to evolve like most other
industries.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so don't think of it that differently,
right, in terms of from an investment
[SPEAKER_06]: standpoint and how it's going to evolve
and where the opportunities are because
[SPEAKER_06]: we're going to look back in 15 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, oh yeah, that's just like
everything else that evolved at some point
[SPEAKER_06]: in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I think is interesting
though?
[SPEAKER_04]: You pointed out about the other industrial
uses of hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is where I'm seeing some large
multinational companies like fashion
[SPEAKER_04]: brands are talking to those companies
because they have something proprietary
[SPEAKER_04]: and special about how they can create an
actual textile that's user friendly,
[SPEAKER_04]: actually eco-friendly, and something that
these large companies can work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they can talk about this really
interesting story about bringing hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: back, bringing seed, they're calling it
seed to sown movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's some, but that's where I'm
talking about with the moat that gets
[SPEAKER_04]: really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's when the M&A gets, that's when
you get the better buyout.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great point because really the only
thing that concerns people right now about
[SPEAKER_06]: CBD is the FDA issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many other uses of hemp that
there's literally no restrictions now to
[SPEAKER_06]: develop products using that plant for all
those other products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I want to thank the folks at ICBC
and our panel as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it again for Alan Brockstein.
