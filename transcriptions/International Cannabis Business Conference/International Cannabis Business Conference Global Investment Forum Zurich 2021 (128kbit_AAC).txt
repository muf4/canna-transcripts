[SPEAKER_01]: Networking is important in any business,
but particularly in cannabis, because
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can have telephone calls with one
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do Zoom calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing beats a face-to-face contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the ICBC is the right place to
do it because it's an intimate
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this conference.
[SPEAKER_06]: Traditional networking for me works via
LinkedIn, via conferences.
[SPEAKER_06]: But these people don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: They tend to be more discreet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm here to see them.
[SPEAKER_06]: What makes ICBC special for me,
it's a conference that focuses on
[SPEAKER_06]: investment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's probably the only one that's
face-to-face today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here at the ICBC conference to be part
of the European market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry is developing a lot
in Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will be a premium player.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only niche that I see that we
can sustain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Networking is critically important in the
cannabis industry because we are all
[SPEAKER_04]: facing the same issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of the day, we face cost
pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: We face issues with legislation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're waiting for liberalization in a lot
of arenas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And therefore we need to stick together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to network.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to learn from each other and work
as an industry and not as a single entity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is one of the longest-standing
sophisticated event organizations with a
[SPEAKER_02]: history in North America that has done an
incredible job in setting up in Europe and
[SPEAKER_02]: giving us those not necessarily in Europe
access, so a gateway to better understand
[SPEAKER_02]: these emerging markets across Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the most important functions of the
ICBC is that being the first international
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis business conference it wasn't
like a high-time show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, let's get together and all smoke
weed and talk about how amazing the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, how can we use business and
finance and compliance to actually create
[SPEAKER_03]: the businesses that's going to get
medicine to people, start the adult use
[SPEAKER_03]: program, get the right investors into
these programs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because without the ICBC, I mean,
that's hundreds of companies we wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have been able to work with or new
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every day I'm just honored and humbled
to be able to share what I know with this
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
