[SPEAKER_06]: And here to lead us in our next panel
where we will discuss emerging
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunities in Europe's biotech and
pharmaceutical industries, all the way
[SPEAKER_06]: from Germany, one of my favorite people on
the planet, a longtime cannabis activist
[SPEAKER_06]: and a great person and the founder of the
MJ universe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it for Lisa Hogg.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for being here on this
panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pleasure for me to be the moderator
for this panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to introduce Lisa to the super
interesting topics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis is a highly complex ingredient
that as we've learned, we all understand
[SPEAKER_05]: that there are different industries
interested in the topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So especially for the biotech,
life science, and pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_05]: industries, it's becoming more and more
relevant and becoming more and more
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting for a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my pleasure to have here today She is
the chief of quality and commercial
[SPEAKER_05]: officer at urgent biopharma.
[SPEAKER_05]: She has a specialization with her company
on the manufacturing of non-sterile
[SPEAKER_05]: liquids including cannabis-based medicines
with a specific EUGMP license and she has
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 plus years of experience in a highly
regulated and complex compliance context
[SPEAKER_05]: and navigating complex ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then we have Danielle Bernstein from
president at Lower Crest.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are a US-based, USGMP-based certified
cannabinoid manufacturer and she's here
[SPEAKER_05]: today to look at global expansion with her
venture and also to help bring her mission
[SPEAKER_05]: across the globe to give access to safe
plant-based medicines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have Dr. Marieta Chase in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's chief regulatory affairs officer at
PharmaHemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the pleasure to have her on another
panel years ago so it's great to have a
[SPEAKER_05]: familiar face on one of my panels again.
[SPEAKER_05]: She graduated at the faculty of Pharma
with a PhD in eco technology here in
[SPEAKER_05]: Slovenia I think and she has been a
scientist for Slovenia and other EU
[SPEAKER_05]: projects and has been involved on
different levels for different segments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in 2018 she joined PharmaHemp with a
specialization on cosmetics, food
[SPEAKER_05]: supplements and medicinal products.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as you can see we all have API
specialists here on this panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to start with you,
Marieta.
[SPEAKER_05]: You work at PharmaHemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a EU-based company that offers a
variety of CBD products.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have also established our R&D
department.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your experience so far regarding R
&D projects and cannabinoids applications
[SPEAKER_05]: and formulations?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that is correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: In PharmaHemp we have our own R&D
department and we are also registered as a
[SPEAKER_02]: research organization since 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: In total we have now five researchers
working on different types of R&D projects
[SPEAKER_02]: and briefly I will explain them and I will
read a few of them just to be sure not to
[SPEAKER_02]: misspell them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first project that was co-founded
by the EU was new generation of hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts for natural cosmetics which
lasted for two years since 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we had two projects which were
performed in collaboration with
[SPEAKER_02]: Mikomedica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mikomedica is a Slovenian company that
produces medicinal mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one was first food supplement
standardized to erinacin-A that lasted two
[SPEAKER_02]: years since 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second project was sustainable
production of standardized food
[SPEAKER_02]: supplements from heresium fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one started in 2021 and lasted for
two years as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last project is safety evaluation of
cannabidiols and implications for public
[SPEAKER_02]: health and consumers behavior shortly
CANSAFE.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is co-founded by ARIS which is
Slovenian research agency and I will just
[SPEAKER_02]: briefly represent some results.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this project in total four different
research organizations are collaborating
[SPEAKER_02]: namely National Institute of Biology,
Faculty of Pharmacy and School of
[SPEAKER_02]: Economics from University of Ljubljana and
PharmaHemp is an industrial partner in
[SPEAKER_02]: this project which is I think I mentioned
co-funded by ARIS so Slovenian research
[SPEAKER_02]: agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: The project started in 2021 and it will
end by the end of this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already have published results from
National Institute of Biology which showed
[SPEAKER_02]: that the PharmaHemp studied isolated CBD
and hemp extract were both found
[SPEAKER_02]: non-genotoxic and also the researchers
confirmed that no DNA damage was observed
[SPEAKER_02]: within the performed Comet assay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another part of this project is
currently ongoing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's performed by the School of Economics
and they are basically examining the
[SPEAKER_02]: public perception towards the use of CBD
different types of products in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are also trying to assess the actual
exposure to CBD products from different
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is something that we are looking
forward to see and the results hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: will be with us in the next few months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sabina already mentioned your EUGMP
license.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you maybe tell us a little bit more
about that and maybe a little bit what
[SPEAKER_05]: you're doing in this regard with the
manufacturing of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good afternoon everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at Argent Bio Pharma in Slovenia is at
this point of time the only manufacturing
[SPEAKER_04]: facility that has an EUGMP certificate
issued by the health authorities of
[SPEAKER_04]: Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Agency for Medicinal Products and
Medical Devices.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a license to manufacture
non-sterile liquids for investigational
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal product.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are aiming to also have a regular
license for regular medicinal products.
[SPEAKER_04]: However the Slovenian regulatory framework
doesn't allow us to upgrade our
[SPEAKER_04]: certification in this sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the comment from the health
authority is usually that there is no
[SPEAKER_04]: legislation for cannabis based products
not even medicinal products so that we
[SPEAKER_04]: need to stay as investigational.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a result we are producing different
medicinal products that are our
[SPEAKER_04]: intellectual property so our medicines or
we can also do custom based medicinal
[SPEAKER_04]: product with custom range of different
ratios of CBD THC and others that we can
[SPEAKER_04]: then supply to other countries and other
markets where this is actually allowed for
[SPEAKER_04]: further treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not only this as Mariette mentioned
for pharma hemp also Argent Bio Pharma is
[SPEAKER_04]: also licensed from the Ministry of Health
to conduct research on different
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we actually exploit in a sense that
we also support research with other
[SPEAKER_04]: facilities institutions in Slovenia like
National Institute of Biology with whom we
[SPEAKER_04]: worked really closely but also we do
research on our own products to facilitate
[SPEAKER_04]: different clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we as a company have sponsored in
different countries like in Australia
[SPEAKER_04]: aiming to finish also in Israel and also
in the United States to show that our
[SPEAKER_04]: products are true medicines and to in the
future to get them registered.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're venturing into the global
pharmaceutical industry from Slovenia
[SPEAKER_05]: basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe what kind of other cannabinoids are
you looking into other than THC and CBD?
[SPEAKER_04]: So firstly we were also investigating the
CBD so Professor Tamara Lach we have
[SPEAKER_04]: cooperated with her and the formulation
was prepared from my colleagues from the R
[SPEAKER_04]: &D department that were supplying it to
the National Institute where they were
[SPEAKER_04]: actually investigating the positive
outcomes on the glioblastoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are open for every opportunity that
comes for different combinations that we
[SPEAKER_04]: can then enforce.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for now we are mostly concentrated in
CBD, CBG, THC and also the full spectrum
[SPEAKER_04]: extract that we have been now for more
than one year supplying to the UKC so the
[SPEAKER_04]: Medical Center of Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are also closely working with the
pediatric clinic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately we were not able to prepare
a medicine like an oil that would be then
[SPEAKER_04]: prescribed directly for patients but we
are supplying the API so the raw extract
[SPEAKER_04]: that is then further processed in the
pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Daniel let's move over to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: How is Laurel Crest participating in
medicinal studies and R&D of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine and for which products which
products do you think are particularly
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting to investigate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Laurel Crest is primarily an ingredient
producer in the United States so we are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually producing CBG isolates,
CBD, full spectrum extracts and working
[SPEAKER_01]: with different countries which is part of
the reason that I'm here but all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world and researchers on formulations that
are going into preclinical trials or for
[SPEAKER_01]: instance something we're currently working
on in Japan is people who failed the GW
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical trials are going into a
trial with a full spectrum extract that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're providing and going to see how that
works in a clinical study and so we're
[SPEAKER_01]: also providing the platform which is less
formal than what we're talking about here
[SPEAKER_01]: and like to the medical market but a
platform to basically analyze data and at
[SPEAKER_01]: least be able to offer what's happening
for these patients that didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: success with the pure isolate and the
difference between that and a full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum product so expanding
opportunities in that way and then also
[SPEAKER_01]: full control of the ingredients going into
these formulations and I think an exciting
[SPEAKER_01]: expansion is terpenes and so also working
with some of the leading terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers and doing combinations of
terpenes to see how that improves the
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy of different formulas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, that's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the
public perception of cannabis and also in
[SPEAKER_05]: how this interacts with research and
development.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maita, public perception is varying very
much from person to person, from
[SPEAKER_05]: individual experience, from many levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you address misconceptions and
concerns about cannabinoids based
[SPEAKER_05]: therapies and what role does public
education and also like to a certain
[SPEAKER_05]: extent registration of specific health
claims or looking to register for specific
[SPEAKER_05]: medical indications play in this
discussion?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've talked about the health claims
actually a few years ago now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is true that we've applied for the
authorization of a health claim related to
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD which could be stated somehow like CBD
reduces the stress-induced anxiety but of
[SPEAKER_02]: course authorities have not responded yet
in any way up until now so we have no
[SPEAKER_02]: answer from EC and EFSA on this topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the same for novel food,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, novel food is relatively the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean we've heard before that AHA is very
successful in their toxicity studies in
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trial basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the moment at Pharmahand we put this
project on hold because of the really high
[SPEAKER_02]: investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably all know that clinical trials
are very very expensive and we've received
[SPEAKER_02]: the same request from EFSA like everybody
else who got validated in the EC that is
[SPEAKER_02]: performed the additional animal testing
along with the one that we already did
[SPEAKER_02]: plus clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really a big thing that will or
not happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't you think it's strange that a
lot of people are using CBD products and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's actually publicly available as a food
supplement in many cases and we know about
[SPEAKER_05]: certain risks and it's still so many
barriers in there whereas it would be an
[SPEAKER_05]: easy thing to just put some risk
thresholds or find some individual
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that also something that you are
lobbying like when you're addressing
[SPEAKER_05]: concerns for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to actually comment this but you
can see that the reality here and not only
[SPEAKER_02]: in Slovenia but I think the whole Europe
is that everybody sells CBD as food
[SPEAKER_02]: supplements and authorities are actually
not really responding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean there are some cases available on
RAPEX system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think notification system is in Europe
and you can see there are some
[SPEAKER_02]: notifications that there was a removal of
the food supplement containing CBD because
[SPEAKER_02]: of the I don't know the excess of THC and
something like this but when you see the
[SPEAKER_02]: market is still flooded with this kind of
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you know one is theory and the other is
cosmetics that are like just declared as
[SPEAKER_05]: cosmetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sabina let's jump over to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you can walk us a little bit through
the regulatory landscape here in Slovenia
[SPEAKER_05]: and when it comes to the treatment with
cannabis and what should change here or
[SPEAKER_05]: what should be improved or changed and how
is the experience here different with your
[SPEAKER_05]: experience in other markets?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay so as Marieta said we have a lot of
products on the shelves that are cosmetics
[SPEAKER_04]: but are used as food supplements.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some kind of let's say how you
avoid some regulatory obstacles but these
[SPEAKER_04]: products let's say primarily are not
intended for treatment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So usually for treatment of different
symptoms or diseases medicinal products
[SPEAKER_04]: are used.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I mentioned before what is also an
obstacle for us as a GMP license
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturing site is that we don't have
any concrete regulatory framework when it
[SPEAKER_04]: comes to cannabis based medicinal
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is also I mean it's very limiting how
to bring products to the Slovenian market
[SPEAKER_04]: and not only how to bring products to the
Slovenian market if we produce it as a
[SPEAKER_04]: company for other markets is also a
difficulty to export them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the thing is that in Slovenia cannabis
based treatments are usually allowed as
[SPEAKER_04]: magistral medicines meaning that the
pharmacy can order API's so active
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical ingredients.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are ingredients cannabinoids of any
sort that need to be manufactured in an EU
[SPEAKER_04]: GMP facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a facility that is producing
according to the guidelines for medicinal
[SPEAKER_04]: products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not nutraceuticals this really needs to
be pointed out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these API's are then supplied to the
pharmacy and pharmacy according to the
[SPEAKER_04]: prescription of the prescribing doctor
prepares a formulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: These formulations are in Slovenia also in
the health insurance system so these
[SPEAKER_04]: ratios need to be approved also by the
sector of the pharmacists of Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the only ones that are also
reimbursed that the doctors can prescribe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is very limiting because we don't
we as patients for instance don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: many options into getting the medicine
that you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also it's limiting for the industry in
a sense that we can produce different
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal products that can be offered
that will ease the life of the doctors of
[SPEAKER_04]: the pharmacies and so on but since there
is no regulation we cannot work anything
[SPEAKER_04]: through.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can share an experience that we have at
Argent Biopharma that the pharmacy
[SPEAKER_04]: actually approached us the pharmacy that
they wanted us to produce the oils for
[SPEAKER_04]: them because I'm not sure how many you
have experience with full spectrum
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis extract but these are very
viscous and very hard to work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you need to have let's say a bit of
experience to work with them to dissolve
[SPEAKER_04]: them and so on and also not to compromise
the quality of the extract because we
[SPEAKER_04]: still want the cannabinoids to be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we went together to the agency to ask
for the permission and constantly we get a
[SPEAKER_04]: no because there is no legislation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we are constantly in circles and
it's a shame because in Slovenia I believe
[SPEAKER_04]: we have a lot of know how from different
companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of how they say a lot of
yeah in collaboration with different
[SPEAKER_04]: institutions with health care
professionals between us in the business
[SPEAKER_04]: so business to business we have with
different markets and instead of us being
[SPEAKER_04]: a trendsetter we are waiting for others to
have a trend and then we follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have also very good experience at
Argent we are supplying our medicines to
[SPEAKER_04]: Ireland following also on the last
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Ireland you have a medicinal cannabis
extract access program that they have
[SPEAKER_04]: published three different indications for
which the doctors can prescribe the
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the product needs to go through an
evaluation at the health authority.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not everyone in every company that
produces something can get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you need to show your quality
consistency that you are an EUGMP
[SPEAKER_04]: certified site.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this product is also fully
reimbursed by the health authority and the
[SPEAKER_04]: doctors can prescribe them and there are
several products that you can pick from so
[SPEAKER_04]: that you can also treat the patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is really limiting in Slovenia
and it's high time that we move forward in
[SPEAKER_04]: this sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's holding also back economic potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's jump back over to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you see the great greatest
expansion potential and for cannabis and
[SPEAKER_05]: plant based medicine research and how do
you think this will affect long in the
[SPEAKER_05]: long term also the consumer and patients
maybe also in addition to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm coming from a slightly different
perspective than the more medical route in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sense that it's like the thing that
still keeps it very inspiring is that
[SPEAKER_01]: these products change lives and they're
very it's still kind of a word of mouth
[SPEAKER_01]: industry strangely where your speech this
morning is very moving where parents find
[SPEAKER_01]: that this really helps and then they tell
another parent and then it becomes a
[SPEAKER_01]: larger circle of people who believe in the
medicine because they see that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: really working and it's changing the lives
of the people that they love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do you bring that patient it's
not really a patient network as much as it
[SPEAKER_01]: is like a community of people who really
want to see these accessible to more
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are experiencing whatever
hardship or disease state or mental stress
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is for the people around them
and so using these patient groups or these
[SPEAKER_01]: community groups to collect data around
formulations that can be maybe formulated
[SPEAKER_01]: in a medical setting or formulated like at
Laurel crest you know where we're working
[SPEAKER_01]: with doctors to create the formulations
based on their research and applying it to
[SPEAKER_01]: a community group that wants to also be a
part of the advocacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the data is less formal than a than
a expensive clinical trial but it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: data that's showing that these things work
and you can kind of it depends on the
[SPEAKER_01]: group that you're working with but you can
cross into you know like aura rings and
[SPEAKER_01]: different kinds of ways to measure how
this is treating or improving something or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe not working so that you can improve
the formulation and so it's like I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that these all of the work that we're
doing is super important to continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the message out there that this is a
safe alternative to some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical ingredient you know some of
the pharmaceutical things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribed all the time that are ruining
people's lives and so that's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where Laurel crest sits there
because we're we're really not in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States we do not have to have the
level of compliance that you do in in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe but we're working towards that to
participate and the FDA is going more
[SPEAKER_05]: against it recently and they're also
looking to standardize more right like I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean we are built for compliance so we are
hoping we would love the FDA to say
[SPEAKER_01]: something and do anything it would be very
helpful to Laurel crest and companies like
[SPEAKER_01]: us that are built to to really stay within
the regulatory like escalation of the
[SPEAKER_05]: market yeah but I think it's interesting
to see if you compare like for the
[SPEAKER_05]: audience to compare the last two answers
they are like from from the ladies you can
[SPEAKER_05]: see how this is the conundrum that we are
in yeah at the one hand you just have to
[SPEAKER_05]: consumers who are really who want the
products who are pushing for initiative
[SPEAKER_05]: who are taking the government to court and
then you have the government and the
[SPEAKER_05]: government they don't want to react
because they are scared of making
[SPEAKER_05]: something wrong but you have the experts
there who could help build those
[SPEAKER_05]: frameworks and these ecosystems so it's
something interesting I think that just
[SPEAKER_05]: comes out of that and those two answers
because it shows the contrast yeah so
[SPEAKER_05]: Marita let's jump back over to you what
about the future do you already have new
[SPEAKER_02]: plans for R&D projects sure like always
yes it is true we are all constantly
[SPEAKER_02]: developing new new products new
technologies and for sure I can mention
[SPEAKER_02]: one milestone that happened just recently
we signed a memorandum of cooperation with
[SPEAKER_02]: the TNL company TNL company is a South
Korean based company that produces various
[SPEAKER_02]: types of polymer based technologies which
are basically final products like
[SPEAKER_02]: cosmetics and medicinal products so
together with TNL we are developing at the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment new type of patches that will be
infused with CBD and the thing is that the
[SPEAKER_02]: operational date of the production
facility which will be in Maribor is
[SPEAKER_02]: planned for the second half of 2025 so by
then hopefully we will start producing the
[SPEAKER_02]: innovative CBD patches which will be very
beneficial for the treatment of acne yes
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting and what markets are new are
you look going into Sabina that are new
[SPEAKER_04]: and exciting for you so the most exciting
market would be Slovenia of course but we
[SPEAKER_04]: will still need to wait a little bit yeah
so we are exploring as I mentioned Ireland
[SPEAKER_04]: and we would also expand our portfolio in
the Irish market because Ireland is now
[SPEAKER_04]: also looking into adding pain as an
indication for treatment with cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: based medicinal product we are also
present in the UK for the treatment of
[SPEAKER_04]: epilepsy so refractory epilepsy what we
are now also planning to broaden our
[SPEAKER_04]: portfolio with one of our also flagship
products but for the treatment of
[SPEAKER_04]: Parkinson's disease so we are actually
planning to now cooperate with one clinic
[SPEAKER_04]: that has 200 patients so that we could
also see the benefits in the treatment of
[SPEAKER_04]: symptoms that are connected with the
Parkinson's also non EU market markets are
[SPEAKER_04]: really interesting especially Brazil what
we all know so Brazil also did some
[SPEAKER_04]: changes in the legislation whereas you
cannot just bring a cannabis based product
[SPEAKER_04]: into the market it needs to go through a
sanitary authorization which is something
[SPEAKER_04]: similar as a traditional herbal medicine
in the EU we have been present in
[SPEAKER_04]: Australia but we not sure whether we would
stay there we would mostly like also to
[SPEAKER_04]: focus in the US I think there is a big
potential so we are working very closely
[SPEAKER_04]: with the FDA to also go over some bridges
there and to bring the products there so
[SPEAKER_04]: unfortunately Slovenia has a big interest
of ours but we don't see anything
[SPEAKER_04]: happening in the near future so we are
exploring other markets globally that's
[SPEAKER_05]: super interesting also for the states like
especially for the medicines part there's
[SPEAKER_05]: not so much if you really look at it like
from the standardized like national
[SPEAKER_05]: available kind of things maybe you can
also tell us a little bit for because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: your home market about and how you looking
to get more access there on a national
[SPEAKER_05]: safe and compliant level and how what kind
of international markets are exciting for
[SPEAKER_01]: you the US is a confusing market because
there is so much gray space in the market
[SPEAKER_01]: at the moment and until the FDA says
something publicly it seems like it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: remain and then also with elections coming
up there is no farm bill no new farm bill
[SPEAKER_01]: and so that kind of maintains the status
quo of a lot of gray space and so the
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of our work is really in the
therapeutic molecules and so we see that
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to be added into different
formulations worldwide so that's expanding
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the US it's being added into
cannabis in the regulated market state to
[SPEAKER_01]: state where you're complementing THC with
CBG and CBC and CBN for different effect
[SPEAKER_01]: based products so we're seeing a lot of
expansion there and then our largest
[SPEAKER_01]: expansion this year is a distribution
center in Japan and so working really
[SPEAKER_01]: closely with a patient network there who
advocated really strongly to raise there
[SPEAKER_01]: was recently laws in Japan that were going
to change the THC limits to one part per
[SPEAKER_01]: million they've now advocated for 10 parts
per million which is just a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: better but this patient network we've been
actually working with for five years
[SPEAKER_01]: providing product to this group and so
they're really working with them to
[SPEAKER_01]: advocate to continue to be able to serve
that group of people and so that's an
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting project that's kind of becoming
more realized as the regulations are
[SPEAKER_01]: changing and the Japanese group this
patient group is being more vocal about
[SPEAKER_05]: their rights to super interesting
especially because Japanese the Japanese
[SPEAKER_01]: market are super anti THC yeah so I mean
it all is anti THC they are allowing this
[SPEAKER_01]: one formulation to come in to see but it's
almost like honestly it's almost like they
[SPEAKER_01]: made a mistake and said we're gonna do you
know what I mean but I mean and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what's interesting I think about all the
markets and learning today about more
[SPEAKER_01]: about EU GMP and what it would take for
Laurel Crest to become EU and GMP what
[SPEAKER_01]: that really means like you're everywhere
that I go I feel like I'm learning
[SPEAKER_01]: something else and also no one's really
sure what's gonna happen and so we're
[SPEAKER_01]: expanding as we can you know we've been
we've shipped product into Ghana South
[SPEAKER_01]: America just opening things as it becomes
available and yeah thank you so I think
[SPEAKER_05]: Gaio how many do we still have time for a
quest we have 40 minutes left okay yeah I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't know like now that gives us a little
bit like I didn't expect to be over that
[SPEAKER_05]: early I didn't have a time on so yeah
let's hear it let's hear for them they're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing great yeah then maybe we keep the
discussion five more minutes on stage and
[SPEAKER_05]: then yeah and then two questions yeah okay
so let's keep the discussion a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: more on stage but it's just I think it's
super interesting to see like all your
[SPEAKER_05]: different experiences and what what you're
doing on a local level and how we're all
[SPEAKER_05]: doing our jobs to bring the puzzle pieces
together maybe a question to all of you
[SPEAKER_05]: what do you think should be done and could
be done also by us by regulators or maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: also by getting patient engaged and those
kind of initiative what should be what
[SPEAKER_05]: should happen more that in order to get a
more harmonized framework maybe Sabina
[SPEAKER_05]: start with you what should what should
change there in that regard good question
[SPEAKER_04]: so firstly what so I worked in a regular
pharmaceutical industry so I have been in
[SPEAKER_04]: quality for more than ten years and I came
to Argent biopharma entering a
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical industry connected with
cannabis so for me if you are a GMP
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturer and if you produce medicine
you produce medicine you know it's
[SPEAKER_04]: effective you know it's safe compliant and
you just give it and when I started to my
[SPEAKER_04]: colleagues that are also here were
constantly telling me Sabina it's not that
[SPEAKER_04]: easy how it's not easy we have their
opioids it's easy you give them you
[SPEAKER_04]: distribute them and so on and I noticed
that the biggest obstacle is education so
[SPEAKER_04]: people don't know a lot a lot about it the
problem then second education I mean also
[SPEAKER_04]: from the health care system to the
regulatory and then also to patients
[SPEAKER_04]: consumers that are mixing also food
supplements treatments THC with CBD and so
[SPEAKER_04]: on and I think this is the biggest
obstacle that we have and this is our
[SPEAKER_04]: let's say responsibility in a sense we I
can say in my company we really work
[SPEAKER_04]: closely with doctors with institutions
with clinics for this purpose to educate
[SPEAKER_04]: also we educate our business partners
because a lot of times we get a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: offers that are connected with CBD THC and
then we also need to educate the
[SPEAKER_04]: difference of medicinal product food
supplement treatment daily intake for
[SPEAKER_04]: supplementing food and so on so I think
this is the first thing where we should
[SPEAKER_04]: start is with the education.
[SPEAKER_05]: Daniel what do you think it should be done
more like especially because you talked
[SPEAKER_05]: about the US and the different markets and
I know you have the same situation like we
[SPEAKER_05]: do here with the HHC Delta 8 Delta 10 that
are maybe oftentimes also used in a
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal context but are only available
as a commercial product without the proper
[SPEAKER_05]: help by the for education as you say is
important but let's what do you think
[SPEAKER_05]: should be better?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I do think that in the US
specifically it would be really helpful if
[SPEAKER_01]: the FDA would come out and say something
so that at least manufacturing had to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: certain standards for Laurel Crest for
example we're a GMP facility where our
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure is built to go up into
pharmaceutical if we needed to but we are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that out of like a desire to be a
leader in the industry not because we have
[SPEAKER_01]: to and so we're self regulating based on
our ethics not on any regulatory body
[SPEAKER_01]: that's telling us that we need to be
making the products in an environment that
[SPEAKER_01]: you would want any you know medicine to
come out of and so that would be great and
[SPEAKER_01]: then also just community forums I mean
like this like your network empower
[SPEAKER_01]: women's cannabis you know it's really
important for everyone to be communicating
[SPEAKER_01]: and also linked in the collective movement
towards normalizing hemp and cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: this amazing magical plant that we or
brings us together and not having it be so
[SPEAKER_01]: much about like how much money you're
gonna make all the time because we have
[SPEAKER_01]: seen that that also isn't really a lasting
motivator you know so yeah I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: the continued community and conversation
is one thing that's super important and
[SPEAKER_01]: then more more regulation in the US would
be really nice because we could guarantee
[SPEAKER_01]: that even if you are making HHC or D8 or
all of these different products that have
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of poured out of CBD isolate in the
in the last years to kind of the the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: bill allowed a big definition of what hemp
is and what is derived from hemp it would
[SPEAKER_01]: be great if those were all being made in
facilities that were safe and across the
[SPEAKER_05]: globe more like that is maybe you can add
to that Mayita like because you are active
[SPEAKER_05]: in with ingredients in different standards
of identity what should be the thing that
[SPEAKER_05]: should happen on the European level but
also on a global scale so we can get more
[SPEAKER_05]: harmonized and standardized all the
frameworks where we as entrepreneurs can
[SPEAKER_02]: then act um it's hard to get a global
picture or to harmonize everything I think
[SPEAKER_02]: we've discussed this earlier with within
one of the topics but I would relate to
[SPEAKER_02]: Sabina and I think that the education is
very very important thing here one is we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to educate the doctors because I
think there's still a lack of knowledge
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to cannabis based therapies
one fact is for example that on medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: school the University of Ljubljana the
program still doesn't contain any kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids or cannabis based therapy so
the people that basically finished the
[SPEAKER_02]: medical school have no knowledge about the
already existing medicines that are
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly to be prescribed in Slovenia and
I think this is a big issue another is the
[SPEAKER_02]: education of the people so of the patients
to enable them to use safely and
[SPEAKER_02]: effectively anything that's related to
cannabinoids because people are still
[SPEAKER_02]: using a lot of garage stuff which I think
is very bad and this is something that
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to be changed with an ongoing
communication with the clear communication
[SPEAKER_02]: for example at pharma hand we took some
steps to to try to at least raise
[SPEAKER_02]: awareness I've participated in an
interview on made overnight which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: well-known platform in Slovenia then we
had an open forum where people could
[SPEAKER_02]: anonymously ask any kind of questions that
are related to cannabinoids and cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: therapies and our scientific advisor
professor Stanko Srcic was there to
[SPEAKER_02]: respond to all of those questions they are
still there it was about 50 questions from
[SPEAKER_02]: basically everyone and I think this is the
way that everybody should do it and in
[SPEAKER_02]: this manner we will come to do better
world I have one other thing is because I
[SPEAKER_01]: was touring pharma hemp and they have an
amazing test testing facility which I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that you do too with HPLCs and all
these things but standardization of
[SPEAKER_01]: testing is probably the biggest hurdle to
the US market at the moment you can get a
[SPEAKER_01]: test on your product and you get it back
from four different labs and it's four
[SPEAKER_01]: different completely different tests and
so something that is standardizing how
[SPEAKER_01]: we're reading these ingredients would be
from a worldwide perspective really
[SPEAKER_05]: helpful yeah I think but if you look at
the picture of these developments
[SPEAKER_05]: especially surrounding CBD I don't know in
Europe to me at least it feels a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit like we're in a still sand especially
with all the food regulations and a novel
[SPEAKER_05]: food application and back in 2019 I think
it was when it was decided that CBD is not
[SPEAKER_05]: drug basically there you could already see
some movement against these recreational
[SPEAKER_05]: uses or lifestyle uses but still it's just
like there's a roadblock and there's no
[SPEAKER_05]: solution to it and there's also no no
willingness to release this roadblock and
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be a possibility to
create more harmonized rules because we
[SPEAKER_05]: have like different rules for CBD in the
Netherlands in Germany in France some have
[SPEAKER_05]: special things and it's not so difficult
that we can use the science and data I bet
[SPEAKER_05]: you have security thresholds or don't you
all right so let's open the floor for
[SPEAKER_06]: questions yes yes I
[SPEAKER_03]: have one question you in one moment
Danielle mentioned Japan and their
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations do you maybe have some
insights about their regulations about the
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD and the source of CBD because now is
really funny that they accept CBD only if
[SPEAKER_03]: he's sourced if he's extracted from the
not from the leaves not from the flower
[SPEAKER_03]: just from the stalk and root is there do
you maybe have some info about that is is
[SPEAKER_01]: it going in some different direction it I
mean just like maybe two days ago it is
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to go in another direction and it
was acknowledged that that is antiquated
[SPEAKER_01]: definition but that definition is going
back to I mean it's it's a it's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: very old definition of hemp and related to
fiber and so it just never changed for
[SPEAKER_01]: many many years and with these new
regulations it seems they are not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: require those statements anymore which
obviously if you were importing into Japan
[SPEAKER_01]: and making those statements we know that
it was not true and so that I do feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a shift in Japan and at the same
time the parts per million the THC parts
[SPEAKER_01]: per million is extremely limiting and
extremely difficult to accomplish and also
[SPEAKER_01]: analyze yeah and so part of the testing
like they I mean depending on what lab you
[SPEAKER_01]: go to you could get the thing that you
want or not and there's no standard there
[SPEAKER_06]: so I think it's like a form of prohibition
through over regulation I don't think that
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that the country is
comfortable with THC in any at all like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very uncomfortable with it and so yes
and it's not a hundred percent different
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's kind of like this portal
through this patient group where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not wanting to also hurt their citizens so
I don't know it's changing every day I get
[SPEAKER_01]: like a whatsapp text being like hey this
is the new this is the new thought so I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that it's a really it's kind of a
dynamic situation and they're not planning
[SPEAKER_01]: to say anything definite and for a couple
more months so it could continue to shift
[SPEAKER_01]: but the Anna the analyzation of 10 parts
per million as a limit for THC is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be very difficult to consistently achieve
by any lab but it's in it's an interesting
[SPEAKER_05]: aspect we have the same situation in
Germany I'm on the German board of the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry Association and German industry
Association I was for a long term also
[SPEAKER_05]: responsible for the CBD part and we had a
couple of cases where there were CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: products with full spectrum extract
cosmetics and they said you're going
[SPEAKER_05]: against the single convention on narcotics
this is clearly your drug dealers and they
[SPEAKER_05]: did creams for putting on your skin so
clearly they're not drug dealers and so
[SPEAKER_05]: those kind of situations evolve but I in
my opinion those are rooted in the single
[SPEAKER_05]: convention in in outdated and wrong
definition because you just mentioned the
[SPEAKER_05]: stocks those of you who know the plant
know that there are little trichomes even
[SPEAKER_05]: to the smallest level or on the sugar
leaves and all those kind of things so I
[SPEAKER_05]: am personally lobbying to change the
definition and to get the update in the
[SPEAKER_05]: single convention for these definitions
because they're just not right it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: technically wrong do we have more
questions yes thank you very much and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a some question my name is Elia
Resnik I'm a psychiatrist and the director
[SPEAKER_00]: of International Association of
Cannabinoid Medicine several years ago we
[SPEAKER_00]: made a summary search what is wrong with
CBD oil it was it had been published where
[SPEAKER_00]: we collected the samples from the 20s
pharmacies where there and our OTC sources
[SPEAKER_00]: where the CBD oil had been sold and we
made assessment in Leiden laboratory using
[SPEAKER_00]: HPLC in order to compare what doesn't
indicated on the label and what is real
[SPEAKER_00]: content we found that more than 50% of the
labels were faked more than 50% contained
[SPEAKER_00]: even more concentration majority less but
some samples had a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations that it had been indicated
so we suppose that no control really
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to this area so how we can
calculate it using in my clinical practice
[SPEAKER_00]: in clinical practice in Germany other
countries where the OTC no nobody checked
[SPEAKER_04]: it really please may I respond I suppose
this was taken from Slovenian pharmacies
[SPEAKER_04]: if I may ask meaning drug is like drug
drug remarket in Slovenia in Israel or did
[SPEAKER_04]: you take him where from Israel aha was it
with the one with Arnold the CBD lemma I
[SPEAKER_04]: misunderstood this okay so firstly HPLC
even though it's a high-performance liquid
[SPEAKER_04]: chromatography it can show varying results
if the method is not qualified and
[SPEAKER_04]: validated so if we have oils in different
matrixes and different matrixes and
[SPEAKER_04]: different ingredients inside and if this
is not brought to the highest level this
[SPEAKER_04]: can also be a reason that the results are
not as what is on the label we had also an
[SPEAKER_04]: experience when the Institute Joseph
Stefan took one of our extracts in oil and
[SPEAKER_04]: their results were drastically different
from the result of our laboratory that has
[SPEAKER_04]: a validated method so just saying that
when you use an HPLC doesn't mean that the
[SPEAKER_04]: result is something that you can rely on
and this is also when my colleague here
[SPEAKER_04]: Daniel mentioned that you can have HPLC
analysis in four different laboratories
[SPEAKER_04]: and you get four different results me as a
pharmacist I will get a heart attack
[SPEAKER_04]: because this is we cannot just rely and
say this is a HPLC and it's good enough so
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that this would be the biggest
reason for the difference in the results I
[SPEAKER_04]: will I personally would ask what kind of
method was used whether this method is
[SPEAKER_04]: prepared to be used for the analysis of
different matrixes yeah but I know the
[SPEAKER_05]: research is referencing but it's there's a
publication to it actually but it just
[SPEAKER_05]: shows that within the non-medical part
there is so much fluctuation in the
[SPEAKER_05]: product and that that's I think the point
that is most important that there is a
[SPEAKER_05]: varying quality of product with a lot of
tainting and lot of additional things just
[SPEAKER_05]: shouldn't be in there yeah one more
question yeah okay observation I would
[SPEAKER_02]: like to congratulate ladies on this panel
because you are very hands-on and
[SPEAKER_05]: excellent thank you thank you thank you
yes I'm a big applause oh man do we have
[SPEAKER_06]: one more question or I don't know we're
out of time I'm sorry we're supposed to
[SPEAKER_06]: stop at 430 it's like 433 so all right on
my case if we run too late
[SPEAKER_05]: thank you ladies thank you for being so
wonderful all right all right the energy
[SPEAKER_06]: is good everybody's excited
