[SPEAKER_01]: Our next panel will be discussing the
current challenges of the cannabis social
[SPEAKER_01]: clubs in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta say, I love all the cannabis
social clubs in Spain, so I'm very excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To lead this panel, please welcome Oscar
Párez.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I get close?
[SPEAKER_01]: Close enough?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks a lot for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to need a translator who
doesn't understand Spanish.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an honor and pleasure for me to
introduce these two panelists today.
[SPEAKER_03]: To put in context what's happening in the
Spanish state in relation to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: clubs, I'm going to make a small summary
of where we come from, and then I'm going
[SPEAKER_03]: to give them the floor so they can tell us
where we're going from their point of
[SPEAKER_03]: view.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, the issue of cannabis clubs
has been around for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first experiences of shared
cultivation began in the mid-90s,
[SPEAKER_03]: in 1994, and it was in 1997 when for the
first time the Supreme Court judged some
[SPEAKER_03]: people responsible for a shared
cultivation and sentenced them to prison,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also inspired a whole other generation
of activists from the legal text,
[SPEAKER_03]: from the sentence of the Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_03]: This sentence inspired this second
generation that opened the first modern
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis clubs, as we know them,
specifically in the Basque Country and in
[SPEAKER_03]: Catalonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could say that between 2006 and 2008,
among other clubs, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: the MACA, which I've seen one of its
representatives here in the city of
[SPEAKER_03]: Barcelona, opened its doors and began the
modern conception of the Cannabis Social
[SPEAKER_03]: Club, which is not only a shared
cultivation, but also a space for
[SPEAKER_03]: distribution, a space directed in an
assembly way, and a community space of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: This expansion of the modern model was
from 2006-2007 until 2012-2013,
[SPEAKER_03]: when in Spain two paths were opened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until then, the movement of cannabis clubs
had been underground, there was no
[SPEAKER_03]: political assimilation, there was no media
debate, but in 2012-2013 an approach was
[SPEAKER_03]: started from two points of view,
what we call the repressive path and what
[SPEAKER_03]: we call the regulatory path.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the repressive path was the Popular
Party, together with the Prosecutor's
[SPEAKER_03]: Office, which instructed all the
prosecutors to from that moment,
[SPEAKER_03]: the people who had a cannabis club were
judged not only for a crime against public
[SPEAKER_03]: health, but also for belonging to an
organized criminal group.
[SPEAKER_03]: This accusation made the prison sentences
go up a lot and that the repression
[SPEAKER_03]: increased a lot, as we will explain now
with our protagonists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the regulatory path began to take
place in some autonomous communities,
[SPEAKER_03]: such as Catalonia, such as Uxcadi,
such as Navarra, such as more than 50
[SPEAKER_03]: municipalities that made their own
regulations of the activity of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis clubs, which over time have been
suspended by the Supreme Court or by the
[SPEAKER_03]: Constitutional Court.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is to say, and as a summary,
despite the fact that there has been an
[SPEAKER_03]: attempt to regulate some aspects of the
cannabis social clubs, the repression
[SPEAKER_03]: today has won.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sentences of the Supreme Court of 2015
make it very difficult for the survival of
[SPEAKER_03]: the model of the cannabis social club and
also push the people who lead them to very
[SPEAKER_03]: wide prison sentences.
[SPEAKER_03]: All this paradox is located in the current
moment where, on the one hand,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the Congress we have a bit of
fireworks, with these proposals of law
[SPEAKER_03]: that exist now, of which two have already
fallen, with the subcommission that will
[SPEAKER_03]: regulate the medicinal cannabis,
but all this is far from ordering a
[SPEAKER_03]: reality that is the reality of the
cannabis clubs, which is being
[SPEAKER_03]: asphyxiated, at the same time
[SPEAKER_03]: that we have more and more people from
other countries who come here to copy this
model and replicate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are countries where the cannabis
clubs have been inspired by our model and
[SPEAKER_03]: it is legal, while here this model is
expiring.
[SPEAKER_03]: With all this context, I am going to
introduce you to the two companions of
[SPEAKER_03]: today's table so that they have their
point of view.
[SPEAKER_03]: First we have on my right Patricia Miguel.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is a cannabis activist,
anti-prohibitionist and feminist.
[SPEAKER_03]: She has some studies of administration and
finance and currently she is studying
[SPEAKER_03]: social anthropology.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of positions in the cannabis
movement, she occupies the presidency of
[SPEAKER_03]: the CATFAC, which is one of the two
federations in Catalonia.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is co-founder of REMA, which is the
State Network of Anti-Prohibitionist
[SPEAKER_03]: Women, and spokesperson of the CONFAC,
which is, at the level of the Spanish
[SPEAKER_03]: state, the entity that federates the
different cannabis groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was president and founder of the
Pachamama Club, one of the first clubs in
[SPEAKER_03]: the city of Barcelona, which went through
a judicial process in which I can
[SPEAKER_03]: participate as a witness in the trial that
they finally won, but Patricia had to
[SPEAKER_03]: leave first because she was pregnant at
the time of her child.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a particularly complicated
situation to be judged with all this
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, Albert Tio.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a social and cannabis activist,
also defined as so.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a degree in sociology, he was
founder of Airam, one of the clubs that in
[SPEAKER_03]: this first wave in Barcelona somehow
opened the doors to the limits regarding
[SPEAKER_03]: the clubs that there were before.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is president of the FEDCAC,
the other federation in Catalonia,
[SPEAKER_03]: promoter of the party Luz Verde,
a cannabis political party at the state
[SPEAKER_03]: level for the regulation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is currently writing a book together
with Steve DeAngelo, who is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: extend it, called Green Light to Freedom,
which will be presented in April,
[SPEAKER_03]: and pending a campaign for an injunction
for the prison sentence that is currently
[SPEAKER_03]: being carried out in third grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is waiting for the Spanish government
of this injunction, he has been waiting
[SPEAKER_03]: for more than a year and a half,
and he is one of the most repressed people
[SPEAKER_03]: in the Spanish state, having to go to
sleep in jail several days a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: For this reason, he has much more merit
than he has accepted to be here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: For my part, nothing more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pass you the microphone, and my question
would be, from your privileged point of
[SPEAKER_03]: view, but also highly repressed,
how do you see the current situation and
[SPEAKER_03]: especially how do you see the future?
[SPEAKER_03]: Patricia, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, thank you, Oscar, for inviting me
to participate in this talk with you two,
[SPEAKER_00]: who are great colleagues, and thank you to
ICBC for making it possible to be here
[SPEAKER_00]: again, to be close to people again,
and to be able to exchange experiences and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will answer your question through
several questions that have also been
[SPEAKER_00]: formulated a bit, and if you have any
questions, please feel free to ask them.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I would like to explain that CONFAC
is an organization that has been in the
[SPEAKER_00]: social activist movement for more than 30
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been an organization for more than
19 years, fighting because the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: social club model, the rights of users and
the right to self-cultivation have been
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized in our legislative system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are one of the valid interlocutors,
along with the rest of the colleagues who
[SPEAKER_00]: have been coming out to be able to deal
with cannabis policy in this state,
[SPEAKER_00]: and although we have more and more
interlocution, as Oscar says, there is
[SPEAKER_00]: also a proportional repression to the
amount of interlocution there is,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it is very paradoxical to understand
what role we play in the movements social
[SPEAKER_00]: in the regulation of cannabis in the
Spanish state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must understand that we are a country
with a very rooted popular character,
[SPEAKER_00]: which above all arises from the bottom up,
and that we are the society that we push
[SPEAKER_00]: because it legislates in any aspect,
but above all in the subject of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are the ones who educate politicians,
who are supposed to be responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: giving us an alternative and an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a phenomenon of social resistance
because the Spanish state has deeply
[SPEAKER_00]: rooted the prohibitionist message and
prohibitionist policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are grounded in prohibitionist
structures that, of course, as in all
[SPEAKER_00]: places, have some exceptions, but we must
understand, and above all I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: within this context of the ICBC,
understand that it is very difficult for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to accept a model of regulation that
is very opportunistic, not because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to, but because they are very
afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very afraid, not the social
movements, but the ones responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need a lot of strength, those of us
who are below, to force the machinery of
[SPEAKER_00]: those above.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all of this, I want to conclude in
this aspect that we are fighters,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are real fighters, and I am sure that
Albert will get the indulgence because it
[SPEAKER_00]: is a work that we have been doing together
for a long time, many people, and as I
[SPEAKER_00]: said before in my speech, it is necessary
to dignify the model and the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: have been working on it for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to say that what role do
associations play as a model of access to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in a future regulation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is the only real experience of
access to cannabis that contemplates the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire circuit of which we have knowledge,
regardless of the illicit markets or
[SPEAKER_00]: self-cultivation and self-sufficiency,
but it is the only real experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: which we have here in Europe that works
and that also generates a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: consensus.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Oscar has said, new alternatives are
being adopted by the model of regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: of clubs, so we understand that it is a
way of access to cannabis that is also
[SPEAKER_00]: very aligned with the objectives of Agenda
2030 and that also has the capacity of not
[SPEAKER_00]: generating overproduction or waste because
we work under demand, so it is a control
[SPEAKER_00]: system that exists and that can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to mold it, we are going to
debate it, we are going to work it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we are going to recognize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed, in terms of cannabis social clubs,
Spain needs an order of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed, there is a range of cannabis
social club models within the State,
[SPEAKER_00]: motivated by the lack of regulation,
by the lack of responsibility of the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislative power and that they are a
reality and that none can be avoided,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the most activist to the most
commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, we are going to work,
we are going to see what their strengths
[SPEAKER_00]: are, what their weaknesses are,
we are going to put the name that pertains
[SPEAKER_00]: to each thing, and we are going to work so
that this regulation comes forward,
[SPEAKER_00]: a regulation that contemplates all the
sensitivities that exist in this State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also want to add a part that I think
should be mentioned, which is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: model itself would be designed not to
leave anyone behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the opportunity to give access to
the most vulnerable groups through the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis social club tool that could
benefit from the entire community system
[SPEAKER_00]: of proximity, that could even help them to
use cannabis as a substitute for other
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption of other harmful substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, I don't know how to mention it,
but yes, more harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we believe that it is a tool that also
allows not to leave anyone behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is important to note that a
regulation of cannabis should always
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve the balance between the health of
people, the rights of people and the
[SPEAKER_00]: economic factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need policies that put people and their
health in the center, that do not leave
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone behind, of course, but that we look
for a way to have a harmonious,
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible relationship that balances and
fights for the public good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it can be achieved because
there is room for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to mention the issue of the
European regulation model versus more
[SPEAKER_00]: international models such as the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to point out that, as I have said,
we are very fearful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legislative power is afraid of losing
power because, in the end, the
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibitionist message has choked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can make our letter to the kings,
but we have to do a lot of pedagogy,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to do a lot of work within the
political offices to explain to them that
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be done, but it must be done
responsibly and, obviously, we must give
[SPEAKER_00]: option and space to all other movements in
the social market, the commercial market,
[SPEAKER_00]: and generate a harmony that does not
generate monopolies, that does not leave
[SPEAKER_00]: the limits of what could be a good for all
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there space for everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends on what kind of investment
or what kind of interest they have in
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to be here in the Spanish state
when cannabis is regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we want to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want it to be something for a few?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can we benefit from the good of the
plant and the benefit that this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: means to humanity?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, another thing is that it is not
that we do not want a market from our
[SPEAKER_00]: organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want is for it to be a diverse
market, a competitive market, and a market
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on consumers and public health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, we are here to accompany,
to advise, to offer our experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: our knowledge, and to really end all the
evils that prohibitionism causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, if there are any more questions,
we will continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Pati.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will now pass the floor to Albert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Albert, from your point of view,
where are we and where are we going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Pati.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Oscar, for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had written a presentation, but due to
the time limit, I will have to select the
[SPEAKER_01]: most important one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had also written it because I did not
want to forget anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, well, I am in prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to sleep from Monday to
Thursday in third grade for a five-year
[SPEAKER_01]: sentence for illicit association and crime
against public health.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this has given us more strength than
ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, David, for following this fight
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to take advantage of it for
the visibility that a situation like this
[SPEAKER_01]: gives you, to be able to use it in favor
of the whole goal, which is this global
[SPEAKER_01]: fight and this common goal that I put a
little as a mission to try to unite in our
[SPEAKER_01]: common goal instead of dividing ourselves
in the details, in the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were a federation, we came to the
point where we thought that we were doing
[SPEAKER_01]: a very complicated job with another
federation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to merge, it did not happen that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, well, we decided to take a step
towards politics because we were very
[SPEAKER_01]: tired of seeing how, after so many years,
political parties gave us a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: they said yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Catalonia, yes, it has advanced a lot
and we managed to pass a law by majority
[SPEAKER_01]: parliamentarian in 2017 and in Navarra it
was also approved in 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, well, the Conservative Party
commissioned to put a resource to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Constitutional Court, which at the time
annulled the laws and in the end it was
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely overthrown, being in Catalonia
one of the 14 social laws that were
[SPEAKER_01]: overthrown by the Constitutional Court.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this path of political incidence we
have done here, we have been told that we
[SPEAKER_01]: had no competencies and then we are going
to Madrid, which is where, in theory,
[SPEAKER_01]: if there are competencies, if there are no
competencies there, we will go to Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the situation has given us more
strength to continue fighting and that is
[SPEAKER_01]: why we have created this party,
which is not created, but was already
[SPEAKER_01]: created in Navarra, cannabis
representation, RCN, NOC, and we simply
[SPEAKER_01]: proposed to give way to the national
environment to go where it is legislated,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the chambers where the laws are made,
to the congress of the deputies and not
[SPEAKER_01]: even to get a scion, which needs many
votes to get a scion, but a scion would be
[SPEAKER_01]: something representative to be able to
make law proposals, to be able to make an
[SPEAKER_01]: incidence and maybe to decide some issues
that are sometimes decanted by a vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we decided to take this leap and well,
I wanted to talk here about both the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis clubs and the industry,
because I think that the industry and the
[SPEAKER_01]: social model are compatible and they are
needed and they are fed back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the advantages of the social model are
that they are a model that, in part,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the civil society that is organized,
it has values such as horizontality,
[SPEAKER_01]: democracy, transparency, prevention of
risks, minimization of damages,
[SPEAKER_01]: derivation of addictions to other entities
that can treat them, information on
[SPEAKER_01]: health, reduction programs and the
abandonment of tobacco and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will get the consumption out of the
street and it is compatible with the
[SPEAKER_01]: existence of an industry with which it
will also maintain commercial relations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The political incidence has been worked a
lot, but the lack of regulation makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to work with legal insecurity at
the level of the associations and at
[SPEAKER_01]: present, both in Barcelona and in other
places, the Spanish territory is pursued,
[SPEAKER_01]: inspected, prosecuted and many times
sentenced to stratospheric fines and
[SPEAKER_01]: prison sentences, as in our case.
[SPEAKER_01]: That same lack of regulation is the one
that allows projects of all kinds to
[SPEAKER_01]: materialize, from the most associative,
assembly, democratic and transparent,
[SPEAKER_01]: to foreign companies that diversify their
economic activity by setting up clubs in
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain or even others, darker in which they
can see organizations of the black market,
[SPEAKER_01]: both local and foreign, but in the end
they are all judged with the same razor
[SPEAKER_01]: and they are doing it, both if they are
doing it well, as following the codes of
[SPEAKER_01]: good practices and cultivating,
or theoretically wrong, buying in the
[SPEAKER_01]: black market, totally contrary to the good
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the situation for most of those of
you who are here, I am not going to tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you, because we already know that the
Spanish agency of medicine and health
[SPEAKER_01]: products is granting licenses to 60% of
companies that are foreign, multinationals
[SPEAKER_01]: in the majority, hypothetically for
medical use in countries where it is legal
[SPEAKER_01]: or for research, but this creates a
contradiction with the denial of access to
[SPEAKER_01]: local patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the receiving countries, this raw
material can also end up in recreational
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, in Barcelona right now there are
inspections in all associations that are
[SPEAKER_01]: seen as stigmatized and this is because of
the fact that these ordinances that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been created in some areas of the
territory, many times they are created
[SPEAKER_01]: more than to adopt legal security,
they are designed in a restrictive way to
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent the creation of associations and
by impossible distances to sports and
[SPEAKER_01]: educational centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is followed by its course,
so we believe that right now the
[SPEAKER_01]: associations are threatened with
disappearance, both in Barcelona and
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the state, because the
ordinances are going down and the judicial
[SPEAKER_01]: system and the police are exercising a
devastating repression.
[SPEAKER_01]: As for the industry, the cannabis industry
should always seek to establish the
[SPEAKER_01]: principles of good practices, as the
social movement has done, in which
[SPEAKER_01]: priority is given to equality and
opportunity criteria through policies and
[SPEAKER_01]: actions that allow, on the one hand,
racial parity, especially in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States, cultural, sexual and class,
or acquisitive power, and on the other
[SPEAKER_01]: hand, a reparation, which will never be
enough to repair the damage caused by the
[SPEAKER_01]: provision, both in its beginnings,
in which it has already been shown that
[SPEAKER_01]: the causes of the provision were an excuse
or mechanism for the weakening and
[SPEAKER_01]: persecution of the populations in the
increase of Mexican immigrants and black
[SPEAKER_01]: residents in the United States,
as well as in all other countries and in
[SPEAKER_01]: all other situations with prison sentences
that have mostly fallen in the Hispanic
[SPEAKER_01]: black population in the United States or
on the one with the least acquisitive
[SPEAKER_01]: power in other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in our case we want to give
visibility to the damages of the
[SPEAKER_01]: provision, which are much greater than
those that the plant itself can cause,
[SPEAKER_01]: and with our condemnation and being at the
gates of jail, well, being already in
[SPEAKER_01]: jail, we expect an injunction that,
surely, to punish us more severely,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are making us wait inside,
and possibly it will not arrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to make it visible, for no reason
and without meaning, the status quo that
[SPEAKER_01]: intends to preserve a situation that only
benefits the market and the illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: networks, that brings out greater benefits
with the provision, preventing society
[SPEAKER_01]: from benefiting from the medicinal
properties of the plant, on the one hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: and of all the benefits in the form of tax
collection, creation of workplaces,
[SPEAKER_01]: and generation of economic activity that a
regulation or a legalization would lead
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, to summarize, as you had
mentioned at the beginning that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about the past, the present and
the future, the past inspires me to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that the present is the struggle of work,
advances and setbacks, conquests and
[SPEAKER_01]: condemns.
[SPEAKER_01]: The present is resistance and resilience,
to adapt and reinvent ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the future is unpredictable,
it depends on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a great, exciting challenge,
at a local and global level, with crises
[SPEAKER_01]: in all areas of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe in cannabis, its industry and
its social model as a new, healthy good
[SPEAKER_01]: for social, political and economic
relations, as well as for the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: and for the health.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry cannot be separated from the
cannabis culture to which it belongs,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is not a link, but a quality that
must make it different and unique,
[SPEAKER_01]: a new open way to transform this world
into a more just, free, peaceful,
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable and solidary one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we want?
[SPEAKER_01]: An unbridled capitalism of unsustainable
growth and destructive competition,
[SPEAKER_01]: or new, more sustainable ways to grow in
collaboration and solidarity and equality
cooperation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sure that the market itself and its
demand will sing for the second time,
[SPEAKER_01]: as there are more and more conscious and
committed people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are, we are, hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in the moment of the birth of a
great industry that has already evolved in
[SPEAKER_01]: other countries, but here it is being
born, and at least in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is our responsibility to be an
alternative model adapted to the new era
[SPEAKER_01]: and to the collective awakening of
consciousness, of respect for nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: for freedom and for human rights,
the conquered and those who remain to be
[SPEAKER_01]: conquered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is why, as we are in a business
fair, which is why we are in jail,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a very funny paradox, I invite the
industry to invest in activism,
[SPEAKER_01]: in reparative measures, with the most
punished collectives for the prohibition,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that they invest in all the projects
that exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the United States, they are very
advanced in this regard, with the project
[SPEAKER_01]: The Speech on the Project, here we want to
bring it here, but we have the impediment
[SPEAKER_01]: that here it is not legalized,
and there it is, with which we first
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that we had to bet for looking for
that goal of legalization and at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time trying to get all the prices of
prisons that are for cannabis without
[SPEAKER_01]: violence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And please, let the industry get wet,
that we need it, and thank you very much
[SPEAKER_01]: to all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much Albert.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have time for a question from
the public.
[SPEAKER_03]: A question, a little question.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have three minutes before the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you started Pati with the question,
and then there is a table just for this,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I wanted to thank Albert for all the
work and effort and vision, because you
[SPEAKER_02]: were just talking about the prisoners,
and it is curious how in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States, how this movement has been managed
in the last three or four years that it
[SPEAKER_02]: has started to gain strength, and that
still in Spain, because it is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: cost and it is missing, but the reality is
that what you are representing today,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably there are like 500 people who are
in prison for growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: and in most cases, we know that there are
many cases of self-cultivation,
[SPEAKER_02]: of people who have been working for clubs
and who are going through that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thank you for that, because it is
inspiring, just that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Muchísimas gracias for our entire panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys, that was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sure they will be outside,
ready to answer any other questions or statements.
