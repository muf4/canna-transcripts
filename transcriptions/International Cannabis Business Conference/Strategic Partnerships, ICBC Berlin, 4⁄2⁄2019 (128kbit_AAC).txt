[SPEAKER_04]: What we do, just real quickly,
because it's not so much about me,
[SPEAKER_04]: but about these guys just as much as we
produce these little humidification
[SPEAKER_04]: pouches that solve a very valid problem in
the industry, which is evaporation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have flour and it's too dry,
you lose a lot of its potency because the
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes would evaporate with the water
that's leaving the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also when you sell flour that's too
dry, you lose money because it's sold by
[SPEAKER_04]: weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it's too moist, you might lose
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to mold, which is equally bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our product will keep it within that
specific range, if you believe ASTM at 65
[SPEAKER_04]: to 55% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all natural.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to talk to me about it,
we have a booth out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it about me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boveda, interestingly, is a small company.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are made of like 30 people in
Minneapolis, in Minnesota, but we sell on
[SPEAKER_04]: a global level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, this would not be possible
just for us on our own.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we rely on a big myriad of
partnerships, as do these guys here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me just give you a quick
introduction here to our panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So ladies first, let me start with the one
that has the longest commute, Fleta
[SPEAKER_04]: Solomon.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's the CEO, no, managing director.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the official title for Little Green
Farms out of Perth, Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And remember when I met you the first time
roughly a year ago, you still claim to be
[SPEAKER_04]: the only local producer for cannabis in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that still the case?
[SPEAKER_02]: You bet, sure is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you give a little introduction
about you and your company?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Benny, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Fleta.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, the perks of coming from
Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently everybody feels sorry for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get to go first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, it's been a remarkable ride and
journey for Little Green Farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Australian market opened up towards
the end of 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a couple of years on, here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the first and the only producer in
Australia to be actually producing,
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturing and then providing a
cannabinoid medicine for patient use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're probably a good year ahead of the
rest of the Australian companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are actually relocating our head office
to Europe for the purpose of actually
[SPEAKER_02]: exporting our products now into the German
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as we've heard, the demand is
really high, particularly in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have a unique opportunity in
Australia to provide those EUGMP
[SPEAKER_02]: manufactured products into Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to do that, it is a long way from home
and we need strategic partnerships.
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving forward, our goal as we move
into Europe is about strategies and those
[SPEAKER_02]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you, Fleta.
[SPEAKER_04]: So next, young lady on the panel,
Alison.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a founder and CEO of Cannabis at
Work and the name gives it away a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're an HR expert.
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually ventured from the HR industry
into the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you just tell us a little bit about
the challenges that you see in that field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Canada, which is where we operate
predominantly right now, Cannabis at Work
[SPEAKER_00]: helps cannabis companies with recruitment
and headhunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finding cannabis staff for their
facilities or their business, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: providing other HR consulting services to
growing businesses as they need to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: out those programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see in Canada is we have the
good fortune of very much being a
[SPEAKER_00]: strategic partner to our clients and the
people in the industry as they look for
[SPEAKER_00]: very specialized talent for their
facilities and cultivation operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as some of the other ancillary
businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's been a really great
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in the Canadian market for
almost four years, so we've really grown
[SPEAKER_00]: up with a lot of the momentum that we've
seen over the last while and have the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to provide a lot of insight to
new companies entering the space about
[SPEAKER_00]: what they need in terms of some of the
technical skill sets of their employees
[SPEAKER_00]: and how that all fits into the regulatory
environment in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see in Canada with the growth of
our recreational market is such an
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly fast-paced market, such fast
growth in these organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of our major strengths is to
take some of the stress off of somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who might be in the process of getting
their license in Canada and pair that with
[SPEAKER_00]: the large database of qualified cannabis
employees that we have and make some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those matches occur and some of that
pairing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll leave it there for now.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now from left to right, we have Jonas or
Jonas, Jonas Schramann from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say Jonas because it's all
English now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Founder and CEO of Ridican, which is funny
enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I remember it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was trying to research on your
project, Ridican.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't find anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wrote you an email and said,
what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's all this about?
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you shed a little bit light?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you actually presented it here at
ICBC, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a brand new thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ridican is a new company.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a strategic partner for cannabis
companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: On our own, we for sure have also
strategic partnerships.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most important, I guess, is the Life
Science University of Prague, enabling us
[SPEAKER_03]: to offer services to cannabis companies
who seek possibilities to either back
[SPEAKER_03]: their existing product with credible and
independently created information on a
[SPEAKER_03]: site where it's scientific and
statistically significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or who seek to develop new products to
further their business within the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: This we back up on top with our own film
crew, which is there to document the
[SPEAKER_03]: efforts that our clients are doing within
those research and development networks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we co-own the social media networks of
Highlife Media, which have a concluded
[SPEAKER_03]: reach of around 25 million followers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all in all, Ridican is, for the
companies out there, a possibility to
[SPEAKER_03]: conduct research and development,
combine it with content production and
[SPEAKER_03]: publication possibilities in really strong
networks, in order basically to develop
[SPEAKER_03]: and execute complex tragedies that will
lead to clearly unique and long-term and
[SPEAKER_03]: long-lasting competitive advantages for
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Ridican took quite a long preparation
phase, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We finally, after one and a half years of
pushing and fighting, we got to sign the
[SPEAKER_03]: cooperation contract that allows us to
have that business model and provide that
[SPEAKER_03]: business model to you all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of that long ongoing fight and
since it just happened lately that I was
[SPEAKER_03]: allowed to sign that contract,
we decided to launch completely Ridican
[SPEAKER_03]: here at the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why also in your primary
clarifications, you didn't find a lot that
[SPEAKER_03]: was also on purpose because we wanted to
really do it right and provide all
[SPEAKER_03]: information in the good quality at the
right time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We considered ICBC to be a perfect
situation to do so.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also why I'm clearly lucky to be
here and have the possibility to sit on
[SPEAKER_03]: that panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jonas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then next on to Liam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Liam McReevey is director at Elite
Healthcare Distribution, a wholesale
[SPEAKER_04]: distributor but also importer for medical
cannabis and beyond everything that's
[SPEAKER_04]: catered to the healthcare industry,
also the sports industry, if I'm not
[SPEAKER_04]: mistaken.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you just quickly introduce yourself,
please?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Elite Healthcare Distribution is
an important distribution business for
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals, for unlicensed medicines
in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also looking to operate across
Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got applications underway for the
UK market right now and soon be expanding
[SPEAKER_01]: to Germany, Denmark and other countries,
building up our sales force.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the partnerships for us are extremely
important in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got doing distribution for 11 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The relationship between supplier and
distributor is crucial to managing the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in the digital age, a lot of
brands now want to go directly to the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understand whether they want to own the
consumers in the market so at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time, you need boots on the ground to help
manage that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing that we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another business that we are exhibiting
here with EthnoFarm is consulting and
[SPEAKER_01]: brokering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, there's a wide network of
producers out there that are all looking
[SPEAKER_01]: access to these markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have them to understand compliance
around genetics, product import approvals,
[SPEAKER_01]: finding compliant distributors,
understanding what types of products they
[SPEAKER_01]: can put at the market and how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the partnerships are extremely
important there.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but not least, we have Emmanuel
Kotsian, founder and CEO of Agatou Soviet,
[SPEAKER_04]: not to mistake with the Soviet Union.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope your company lasts longer than this
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're not only publisher of
well-renowned publications that we have
[SPEAKER_04]: here in Germany and Eastern Europe,
but you're really an icon in the industry
[SPEAKER_04]: for over 20 years, I guess, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So could you quickly introduce yourself,
please?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your introduction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, agency Soviet is our name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be scared.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Russian word.
[SPEAKER_05]: Translated, it means the advice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So nothing that serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the Soviet Union disappeared from
this planet, they had not proclaimed they
[SPEAKER_05]: want to have the copyrights about Soviet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we jumped in the game and we grabbed
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the best investments in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started with very simple thing 20 years
ago, with publishing media, with
[SPEAKER_05]: multiplying information about cannabis,
because at this time we could not think
[SPEAKER_05]: about dealing with medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was just no knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And through this media, you can imagine
through 20 years of media producing,
[SPEAKER_05]: we have, of course, a very, very,
very lot of contacts and sources of
[SPEAKER_05]: information.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm really very proud that through the
many years we keep very far ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: When something new happens in this market,
we know it first.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really one of our benefits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the next 20 years, I will make it
short, because we always have tried to
[SPEAKER_05]: figure out what is possible to do already
legally with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we founded a lot of companies and we
started a lot of projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of them failed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also about failing in projects and how to
deal with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody should talk one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: But globally, in this moment, we are seven
different companies in this moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, most important company is our
distribution of CBD products in Germany
[SPEAKER_05]: and over Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can support your words totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want just to add one strategic
advice from my side.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever business kind it was,
it was finally the advice of our lawyers
[SPEAKER_05]: who really made us doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please take really all those
regulations, those which has to do with
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis and also those which don't have
to do with cannabis serious and try to
[SPEAKER_05]: follow them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, no business is possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I told it two weeks ago in Barcelona
on a similar stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I try to figure out if my partner
can explain me his legal situation with
[SPEAKER_05]: his product on this market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the next question I have to my
potential partner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you have also a lawyer who proves
your theory?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we can talk about each kind of
very interesting projects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we give a quick hand sign?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who has a good lawyer here on stage?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a good lawyer?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a very good lawyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You also have good lawyers?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Amy, for this quick start,
because we had to talk about strategic
[SPEAKER_04]: alliances and we have heard it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want to jump over you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because I think his advice truly is
a very good one, because compliance for
[SPEAKER_03]: companies that are in a market that used
to be suppressed for decades, they must
[SPEAKER_03]: make a stand in order to make this
industry survive and thrive like because
[SPEAKER_03]: the backbone that our industry definitely
needs is scientific information,
[SPEAKER_03]: credible information resulting in quality
products that on both people can rely on,
[SPEAKER_03]: because only on those means I think we can
really reframe that public perception in a
[SPEAKER_03]: way so we all have a future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And connecting to this, his advice truly
was right, but it was just considered as
[SPEAKER_03]: far as I see onto the now, because
compliance always is a matter of the now.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I got to do to not be closed down
tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_03]: But that isn't the whole picture,
because the whole picture is that there is
[SPEAKER_03]: also a after tomorrow and the following
week or the following year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, so with the strategic
partnerships, I mean, strategy,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is strategy for companies?
[SPEAKER_03]: It says Drucker, one of the good company
strategists, he said it's doing the right
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Porter said it's using the capacities that
are available in order to create long
[SPEAKER_03]: lasting, sustainable and unique
competitive advantages.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the now needs to be set to have
a stable base, but the future always needs
[SPEAKER_03]: to be considered.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bit like playing check.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you just think about your next step,
you maybe run into problems that you
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't see ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: So try always to focus a couple steps
ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to prepare them to not suddenly get
stuck and always be aware that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's a lot of money in our
industry, but I always tend to say that
[SPEAKER_03]: money isn't everything, because especially
if you have more businesses or different
[SPEAKER_03]: departments in your business or
whatsoever, as soon as you run into one
[SPEAKER_03]: issue, it will seize the growth of
everything, because first of all,
[SPEAKER_03]: you need to take care of the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think working hassle free in good
working synergetic corporations,
[SPEAKER_03]: enabling unique strategies, that is the
way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be also my advice too.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say, sorry, on the
legislation piece, often this stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: changeable and it's written to provide
structure to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we find that both in UK and places
like Australia, if you're willing to put
[SPEAKER_01]: the effort into reading it and
understanding it thoroughly, you will find
[SPEAKER_01]: that there are holes and gaps in
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have the right sort of
partners that can help you navigate that
[SPEAKER_01]: and help you find the opportunities,
especially in a growing market like this
[SPEAKER_01]: early stage, that's where you make the
most money is in the niche opportunities,
[SPEAKER_01]: highest margin, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's finding good partners to help you
with that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done it for a couple of different
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a producer in Australia that's
going to be exporting flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't think they were allowed to
export flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until I read the regulations and find a
loophole and they asked the question a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of times and got a positive
response.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they weren't even considering.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question is, how do we find,
how do you find good partners then?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's an important point
here too, that one of the strategic
[SPEAKER_00]: partners needs to be the regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in Canada, Health Canada is the
government ministry that oversees cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production and distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're learning all this for the
first time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's been really important
to see companies be successful when they
[SPEAKER_00]: build bridges to the regulator and they
use that as one of the partnerships that
[SPEAKER_00]: they leverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say people tend to sort of
shy away from regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like in my experience, most of them
are open to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you approach it in the right way,
you engage them in the right way and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have the right mindset, particularly
around compliance and regulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will work with you 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you approach regulators yourself?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have interest groups that you would
cater to?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because dealing with regulators,
I think we all agree, is very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's a good strategy actually to
tackle that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe further, what's your take?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, look, we learnt a little bit later
in the piece that having relationship with
[SPEAKER_02]: the government bodies and the politicians
is definitely the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the patients are the biggest
advocates and have the biggest voices.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is nothing more powerful than
patience.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, when we're navigating such a
complex new industry, we definitely need
[SPEAKER_02]: to be lobbying all the time to our
governments.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our strategic partners is exactly
that, is the lobbyist firm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got a wonderful relationship
with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think what makes that so strong is
that we actually both share a vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you kind of, like any strategic
partnership, any alliance, it will fail
[SPEAKER_02]: unless you have a joint shared vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without that, you sort of go off track a
little bit and you need to be able to have
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of your KPIs or your metrics and you
need to be able to communicate with them
[SPEAKER_02]: regularly and keep coming back to that end
vision and the goals that you shared to
[SPEAKER_02]: get an objective in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's absolutely right what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: The government institution and to work
closely together with them is a crucial
[SPEAKER_03]: point to have a sustainable survival.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I think that communication
basically happens at the recipient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the information you provide must fit
the reality and the expectations of those
[SPEAKER_03]: independent bodies, which are in that
case, the governmental institutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So usually, as we have realized,
bringing in a third party, which is on the
[SPEAKER_03]: same level, such as in our case,
the University, Life Science University of
[SPEAKER_03]: Prague, creating statistically significant
and independent information with a high
[SPEAKER_03]: credibility can get you actually in
collaboration with those state bodies a
[SPEAKER_03]: long, long, long way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there, that long, long, long way,
basically, that is then that, to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to go that long way, that is then that
unique competitive advantage because you
[SPEAKER_03]: can lay back because you know you're safe,
which means you can focus on actually the
[SPEAKER_03]: work in your market and not constantly try
to clean up behind yourself in order to
[SPEAKER_03]: not suddenly be pushed out of the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you wanted to add to this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, in a really comfortable
situation, because exactly by the fact
[SPEAKER_05]: that we were doing the newspapers now for
nearly 20 years and the fact that this
[SPEAKER_05]: newspaper is read by a lot of people in
the Ministry of Health and whoever is in
[SPEAKER_05]: this game.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we always talking with exactly
those people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes more friendly, sometimes not
that much.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in fact, whenever we publish something
in our newspaper, we see some weeks later
[SPEAKER_05]: a response.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody has read something and this is
even a really super nice situation still.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to keep diplomatic and we have to
deal also with the Ministry of Health
[SPEAKER_05]: still.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, it's a key question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be shy, please go to the press
conference.
Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you are asked by people who are
responsible, they won't bite you.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are normal people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to explain to you the regulation
exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are living in a very transparent stage
in this case.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes they even like to talk about
their work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is always going to be next
election, so they're very interested in
[SPEAKER_04]: what public opinion might be, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we heard a lot about choosing the right
partners, what type of partners we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I'm really interested in is what
is if you happen to have a partnership
[SPEAKER_04]: that doesn't work?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I found from my experience is
what you learn most, basically,
[SPEAKER_04]: is from something that didn't work out,
and then you analyze it, and then you have
[SPEAKER_04]: a chance to actually make it better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything that one of you guys
want to add to this, maybe?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think to be an entrepreneur,
it means to have a great endurance.
[SPEAKER_03]: It means also sometimes to be patient,
but you should never mistake endurance
[SPEAKER_03]: with patience, because patience implies to
be waiting for the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Endurance means keeping to try on to do
something for the right thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a Japanese quote says, it's better to
turn around halfway than staying on the
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong track.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think to be able to define at some
point when you are on the wrong track,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the question we're talking about
here, you need to have a really good
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of the goal where you're
going to, and you need to put milestones
[SPEAKER_03]: in the way to be able to measure the
development that you take towards there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless you do that, you won't be able to
measure your way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I think everyone who's here has a
bit, some experience with things that were
[SPEAKER_03]: going sideways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once you realize that, it can be
painful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It usually is always painful, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you will get over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is then where really that endurance
comes in that you need to have to get back
[SPEAKER_03]: up, wipe off the dust, and keep going,
find a better partner.
[SPEAKER_03]: They surely are out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had somebody maybe an example,
like something that's specific?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I agree with you, but it's
general.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have something we can actually
touch?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll share something with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the most integral and important
relationship, strategic alliance,
[SPEAKER_02]: that this business has, that Little Green
Farmer has.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is with our manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, to get speed to market, and to get to
where we are today, and to be the leader
[SPEAKER_02]: in Australia, we did that through a
strategic partnership with one of the few
[SPEAKER_02]: GMP opiate manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's EU certified, and we were able to
quickly get to where we wanted to because
[SPEAKER_02]: of that certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, our conversations derail all the
time, because I have a cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: company, we've also got, that's one
business unit, and on the flip side,
[SPEAKER_02]: we also have the manufacturing and the
pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got multiple business units.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always going to be disconnects in
between.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes we absolutely fly off the
handle at each other because we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes we think, wow, what would
happen here if we walked away from each
[SPEAKER_02]: other?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It never will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're so tight, because we both
share a vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the moment that the two come together,
the companies start to have this little
[SPEAKER_02]: argy bargy, we get back on track,
we determine what those milestones and
[SPEAKER_02]: those goals are, we get back and say,
why are we actually here?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is our purpose?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we manage to get through it,
and then we get back on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's communication.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we're not communicating all the
time, and also enjoying the little wins
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have, then that's where it
completely can be derailed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that was a really
important lesson, certainly that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: learned, and hopefully you can take away
from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also say additionally to that,
that in every business, if you work really
[SPEAKER_03]: with people who are highly motivated,
which will be a key factor to your
[SPEAKER_03]: success, it is possible to get into
exactly such situations, which is nothing
[SPEAKER_03]: bad, which you should not be afraid of.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a function or a result of that
high motivation that everyone brings in,
[SPEAKER_03]: who sometimes just have a different
understanding that needs to be broadened
[SPEAKER_03]: one point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's say living discussion that you
could have in such a situation,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really nothing bad, despite the fact
that it could have a bad appearance in the
[SPEAKER_03]: first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just try to get over it, stick to your
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be afraid of the little bumps in the
road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think from my experience in the
distribution sense, the shared vision and
[SPEAKER_01]: the goal, they need to be aligned,
and setting milestones is extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: important for evaluating everyone's
performance as you move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to be realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Markets change and shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical cannabis market is very early
doors.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of work that goes into
driving prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CBD market is changeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It shifts around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the important thing is to have a
relationship between two.
[SPEAKER_01]: The communication is important to
understand where things are going,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the fact that you're putting the work
in, that you're still striving to achieve
[SPEAKER_01]: the goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what keeps everybody aligned in
that relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that includes having the right people
on board.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Alison, is there a right way of finding
people that have these talents to secure
[SPEAKER_04]: them for your company in order to have
these discussions with your potential
[SPEAKER_04]: partners?
[SPEAKER_00]: A right way to hire the right people,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's probably hiring your agency,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But what do you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: So first for me would be, how do I choose
the right partner, like HR partner?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what should we look at in discussion
with a potential partner like yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I think that, from my personal
perspective, when we're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the industry, we want there to
be an alignment around our goals and have
[SPEAKER_00]: the confidence that we're going to add
value to their process if we're the
[SPEAKER_00]: service provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think more broadly, I think it also
comes down to finding people that you like
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you can communicate with and that
you do have a sense of trust even early in
[SPEAKER_00]: that relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the hiring side, I think the challenge
with cannabis that we see in Canada is
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are specialized skill sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find somebody who has the background
that they understand cannabis but can also
[SPEAKER_00]: grow that product at commercial scale is a
unique skill set.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not that many people in Canada or
in this country that have that ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of what we call black market
or gray market growers that have a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise, which is important,
and we try to bring those people into the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be challenging at times if
they're not a cultural fit with the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really about finding the right
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think it's just looking ahead
to what are your strategic objectives?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you want to be a GMP certified
facility and operate in the EU market,
[SPEAKER_00]: then making sure that you're going in and
finding people who have experience in GMP
[SPEAKER_00]: from other sectors and bringing them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I think there's some very
industry specific things when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about hiring people into the
industry or into organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the no asshole rule applies
probably when you're hiring for your own
[SPEAKER_00]: organization of good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more broadly, if you're looking at a
service provider or strategic partner,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think how can you add value to each
other's world?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you aligned in terms of really
being bought into the cannabis sector?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll expand for just one more moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we are looking to engage with service
providers and to support our business and
[SPEAKER_00]: our business growth or services that we're
providing, we also look for companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: are focused exclusively on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really simple example is we're producing
a large cannabis career festival in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: in September, and we need a photographer
and videographer to be there to capture
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a company based in Toronto
that is focusing exclusively on this
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pick them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had other choices and other choices
that were maybe slightly more cost
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we believe in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we can and we have the
opportunity, we pick cannabis companies
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so shared values and shared objectives
is one of the key components in all the
[SPEAKER_04]: partnerships.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you agree, Emmy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer to work with companies which
already have experience in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_05]: have the same goal to go to regulate it
all and make it all accessible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, we are also running also a
travel agency for stoners.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, I'd rather like to go with this
company, and I expect something different
[SPEAKER_05]: than with the normal travel agency.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's not easy to deal with a
negative aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, over 20 years and for sure,
two dozen of experiences which nobody
[SPEAKER_05]: wants to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I would not sit here if I would
not be master of positive thinking.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think in each kind of business,
you have really to keep on track and
[SPEAKER_05]: motivate yourself each day to master the
challenges of this day.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the end, most of the problems are about
money.
[SPEAKER_05]: So forget about the money.
[SPEAKER_05]: This day, we will earn another money,
which is a lot better than that which we
[SPEAKER_05]: lost yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever happened, we will sort it out in
the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in this moment, it will block you
whenever you want to solve the very creepy
[SPEAKER_05]: details why somebody did not what was
expected.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It solves itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I was already talking about the
lawyer aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is still you have to put in trust in
the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: Without trust, no business will happen,
never.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my personal recommendation,
yes, have a big vision where to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then still, you have to find out
stepwise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Call it milestones or unique projects,
small projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: But how can we dream of making millions
together when we cannot invest 5,000 euro
[SPEAKER_05]: in going to a certain kind of show or
something?
[SPEAKER_05]: The small things sometimes tell you a lot
about the bigger construction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jonas.
[SPEAKER_03]: May I jump in?
[SPEAKER_03]: To the original question first,
would I, for example, work with cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: companies first?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a clear yes and clear no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think the goal is to also expand
the industry that we're working in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Expanding doesn't work if you only work
with stuff that you have inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's contradictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, expanding is expanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of all, I also want to say that all
eyes of the world are directed on cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is also a good situation to just
pull in resources that did not have
[SPEAKER_03]: connections with cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, who build maybe because as said,
cannabis is a young industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it has all the problems of a young
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the people and the resources that
can be found outside the industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: they maybe have a history of 100 years or
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the professionalism, the possibilities
and the resources that can be one for your
[SPEAKER_03]: business there, they can really make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is why we went with the other two
companies that I have into the
[SPEAKER_03]: collaboration with the university that was
outside the general cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is why we offer those research and
development services to all the companies
[SPEAKER_03]: out there who want to make a difference on
the base of quality product and scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: information that was not created within
the cannabis industry, but within a highly
[SPEAKER_03]: credible network of which they then can
take profit because they will directly
[SPEAKER_03]: profit from the credibility that the
university has built up in over 100 years
[SPEAKER_03]: of existence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for that reason, yes, there can be
some shared visions within the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry that will make it easier to find
a certain plan or a certain getting
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it doesn't mean that the
resources that will enable you to execute
[SPEAKER_03]: that plan will also be just only within
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think talking about strategic
partnerships, I don't think that the
[SPEAKER_03]: approach of tomorrow it will solve itself
is the right one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really doing the right thing
to get to the point where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that always it's a hard thing
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it from my daily business to do
that split of having one leg in the now,
[SPEAKER_03]: taking care of all the issues while
actually preventing all the problems in
[SPEAKER_03]: the future days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I must say from my own experience,
a solution you don't need to like,
[SPEAKER_03]: a solution is a solution in some
situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look only on the present
moment, you may going to choose things
[SPEAKER_03]: that you like because you don't consider
the effects that they will have in the
[SPEAKER_03]: tomorrow or the week after.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's look into the future then.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you think would be the
partnerships that will be most important
[SPEAKER_04]: in the future?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you start with you, Liam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I often talk about the growth of
the cannabis industry, like the tech
[SPEAKER_01]: computer industry, which sort of grew in
phases of complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're in the first phase of
this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's different with cannabis is
that it's effectively going to bleed into
[SPEAKER_01]: like all of these other existing
industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where strategic partnerships
should come from outside the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be looking to take technology
that exists in other industries and use it
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis to scale it faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, the IP and the knowledge
that you develop in your business will be
[SPEAKER_01]: seen to be valuable by bigger players in
those other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where, at the moment,
consolidation is happening within the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in four or five years time,
it'll be happening into lots of other
[SPEAKER_01]: industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's important to note.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the growth opportunities.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you add your producer's perspective,
Fluta, would you agree?
[SPEAKER_04]: What would you add to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, look, one word which resonates with
me all the time is adaptability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, you can source skill sets
anywhere, anyhow, as long as they're
[SPEAKER_02]: adaptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we've grown the business based
on our own experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't necessarily gone and got skill
sets from other countries or bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: brothers, which some of our competitors
have done.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I boast the most amazing,
incredible team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've come from different
backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what they do bring are their own skill
sets and, again, adaptability.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ami, maybe you want to add to this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so I think we make the right
strategic decision three years ago not to
[SPEAKER_05]: take part in the bidding for medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And through the last three years,
fantastic evolution with CPD products and
[SPEAKER_05]: the strategic decision we made we wanted
to have good branded products for the end
[SPEAKER_05]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have Bank on board.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Canopy Gold on board.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Hemp Touch, really wonderful
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is about now, about the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: We make the decision.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is also strategic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something like what you told.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the cannabis market, the medicinal
cannabis market in Germany will be decided
[SPEAKER_05]: by the quality of your cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we decided strategically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we close a part of the deal exactly on
the show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to ICPC for organizing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We make a strategic partnership with our
Israeli partner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will import cannabis from Israel to
Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we hope we can serve the first
patients in Germany before Christmas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they have the highest density rate
on studies, on preclinical studies,
[SPEAKER_05]: of doctors, of patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is like the really point which
will decide this market in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then Alison and then we close with
Jonas.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to add to your future outlook of
partnerships in cannabis space?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just make a comment in closing from
my experience in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think strategic partnerships can be very
formal, strategic relationships to move a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain part of the business forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that my experience in Canada
has been that there's so many strategic
[SPEAKER_00]: partnerships, even at an informal level
within the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we all have this common ground,
which is that we're all working towards
[SPEAKER_00]: the same goal, which is moving forward
medical cannabis and perhaps recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in whatever market we're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that there's a tremendous
amount of power in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although there is going to be competition
in the market, there's at least what we
[SPEAKER_00]: see in Canada, a tremendous amount of
collaboration even amongst licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: producers because they sell to patients or
they sell to a recreational market,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they also wholesale product to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have to have relationships
with one another while also having a
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive place in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that events like this are
tremendously important in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to build relationships with
everybody in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's an important
takeaway as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question was what the future is going
to look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can't answer that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know in the crystal ball,
but I can tell you what I would like the
[SPEAKER_03]: future to look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, surely it is a future where
there is a lot of credible information
[SPEAKER_03]: available created by a wide base of
companies resulting in many high quality
[SPEAKER_03]: products that are out there where people
can rely on because as said, this is what
[SPEAKER_03]: will do the reframing of the public
perception.
[SPEAKER_03]: And preclinical information that Emmanuel
brought to speech is definitely a very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very, very important part of it because
preclinical information that we offer with
[SPEAKER_03]: the university or the creation of such
information that we offer, it's quite easy
[SPEAKER_03]: and quickly able to be done if you have
the right access to it for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And afterwards, the real clinical
information that will then lead to bring
[SPEAKER_03]: in products for regulatory procedures to
do that, I mean, clinical trials on
[SPEAKER_03]: animals already or then on humans,
they always need to pass the ethical
[SPEAKER_03]: committees of the particular country.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another state department or state
institution that we were talking before
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those ones, they need to be convinced
in a very good way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that only works on quality
information, preclinical information in
[SPEAKER_03]: that case.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess in the future, a lot of that
information should be created in order to
[SPEAKER_03]: back existing products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with time pass, they pass them
through the regulatory procedures so they
[SPEAKER_03]: can be widely marketed in the same ways
that we already know so it actually can
[SPEAKER_03]: really manifest itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jonas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the rest of the panelists.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're open for your questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear from this panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very informative.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
