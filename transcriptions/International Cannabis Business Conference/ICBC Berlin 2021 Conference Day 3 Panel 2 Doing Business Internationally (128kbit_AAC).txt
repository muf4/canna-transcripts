[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to our panel, Doing Business
Internationally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm proud, I'm glad to have two real
experts here on stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the right, on the very right,
we have Rudolf Ruffier.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is working for one of the biggest law
firms in the world, for Clifford Chance,
[SPEAKER_05]: a London-based law firm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they also are now consulting cannabis
investments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on my right, we have Pete Pettersen
from Balkan Medical, who is the leading
[SPEAKER_05]: Danish extractor for medical cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are licensed since 2018 in
Denmark.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, Incorporated.
We just got licensed this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, yeah, they incorporated since 2018.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got licensed this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think you just tell us a little bit
about your activities in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we are extracting in Denmark,
taking some cannabis flower from the
[SPEAKER_02]: various cultivation companies that are
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some phenomenal quality that's
being grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're turning it into oil, and that's
heading to places like here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're EU GMP certified, for real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rudolf, cannabis is not so long a topic in
your company, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not such a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did it come?
[SPEAKER_05]: A big law firm is interested in the
cannabis market right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a full service business law firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're based in London, but we have offices
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm based in Australia and in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do international disputes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cannabis practice has been kicking
off, I'd say, five to six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, it started off here in
Germany, in Dusseldorf, Frankfurt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and MÃ¼nchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do mostly regulatory matters,
corporate matters, M&A, in our cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: practice out of Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I take care of the divorce side of
things, I'm afraid, the disputes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm here to talk to you
about today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pete, my first question to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You also have experience in the Canadian
cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the main difference to the European
cannabis market?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the commercial flexibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we know that the Canadian market
is much more mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we see the European market really
just starting to develop its legs right
[SPEAKER_02]: now, trying to figure out how patients are
going to be granted access.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Canada, there was a wonderful program
with mail order cannabis for access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Versus here, seeing in Germany,
they actually have cannabis going through
[SPEAKER_02]: the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's just maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it following a very similar path in
terms of how cannabis industry has been
[SPEAKER_02]: maturing from, say, the North American
markets and over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like watching it happen in the
future, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see how it's been evolving and it's
already been mapped out for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything starts with cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we start to see lots of extraction
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we see more focus on brands and
distribution and access.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask something different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did you not come to Germany and grow?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Germany grows cannabis or extracts
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did you go to Denmark?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the law in Germany was implemented
much earlier than in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it harder to apply here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't want to compete with the
demican guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had such a great proposal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, on the other side of things,
we took a look at the German market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were looking for something with a
little bit more commercial access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Denmark didn't have any restrictions on
how much we could produce, where we could
[SPEAKER_02]: send it, what we could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really just that commercial
viability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also on the Danish side of things,
just doing business internationally,
[SPEAKER_02]: we took a look at the government
infrastructure and how much support was at
[SPEAKER_02]: that government level and how stable that
program was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was another big indicator because we
were looking at Portugal or Greece or
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just made sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Denmark, it was like an eight out of
nine vote to be passed through by law.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the political regime was to change,
there was still majority favor for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just made sense for us for our
investment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rudolfi, thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, in Europe, we have a very lot
of different regulations on medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You are based in Australia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Australia is also importing to the German
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a lawyer, as an investment expert,
what would you recommend somebody who
[SPEAKER_05]: wants to make cannabis business in Europe?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where should he go?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there are a lot of countries who
announced that they will have a medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember like Greece, for example,
some work in Portugal, some work in
[SPEAKER_05]: Denmark, some work in Australia.
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you recommend a strategy to
enter the European market?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thanks, Michael.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I would like to second what Pete
has just told you guys a couple of seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would first and foremost recommend a
stable country, politically stable,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis, and it's not unlike other
industries, frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I do a lot of mining and oil as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big, dirty, stinky stuff that is quite
controversial, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the attitude toward those industries
is fluctuating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen countries that have announced
in Europe, take Greece, that yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be cannabis party.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to liberalize and create a
real market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Government changes because there are
elections like in any democratic country
[SPEAKER_00]: and in non-democratic countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, new government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is not so sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to end up in a country
where that's the case, especially if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a very cheap country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are plenty of countries in
other continents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking Latin America,
Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia,
[SPEAKER_00]: where high risk but high reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so cheap to grow stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it might make sense to take the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Europe is not cheap, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that the first
thing you do is to set up shop in a
[SPEAKER_00]: country where your operations are legal,
and second, where you expect they will
[SPEAKER_00]: remain legal in the years to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I totally get what you've just said,
Pete, and I can only encourage you to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Germany, I think, is rock
solid, frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's little to doubt from Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain has been very vocal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some reservations, again,
based on how they behaved with other
[SPEAKER_00]: industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think renewables.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the turn of the 2000s, they were like,
oh yeah, we're going to go green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those companies, you just can't
make electricity here with those nice wind
[SPEAKER_00]: farms and solar panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be expensive, but don't
worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will subsidize you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Six to seven years later, government
changes like, oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs me a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just forget about the incentives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I've invested hundreds of
millions in that country already,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you told me it's based on incentives,
and my business model revolves on
[SPEAKER_00]: incentives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot do anything for you anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you want to avoid when you
start setting up shop abroad, generally
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my thoughts on Europe,
particularly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Rudolfi.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me just ask you in addition,
because in Germany, we just got the first
[SPEAKER_05]: deliveries from South Africa and from
Lesotho.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you normally hear that,
you also think, or when they announced it,
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought, OK, this is one of the
countries that announced to grow medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, which will never come to German
pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was quite surprised.
[SPEAKER_05]: How come that there's a difference in
Lesotho and South Africa?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, and again, I'm going to
say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is new cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're at that euphoria stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where everybody wants to do it because
everybody sees, you know, there are
[SPEAKER_00]: billions in the industry just waiting up
to be made.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, African countries are no
exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have seen the opportunity just like
what they have before with mining and oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really have the know-hows and
financial capabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, they're attracting a lot of
foreigners and want to attract a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: foreigners to help them develop their
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, they know they're not so
much a consumer market, but rather an
[SPEAKER_00]: export market for consuming markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consuming markets, as we've heard earlier
from Jada, it's here in Europe and it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why now you see those shipments
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are companies from Canada,
from England and even Australia now
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily investing in South Africa,
Lesotho and even Zimbabwe, because they
[SPEAKER_00]: have seen that there is an opportunity to
grow very good quality hemp and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for cheap and then process it maybe in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or processing back home in Australia and
then export it to consuming markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Rudolfi.
[SPEAKER_05]: My next question goes out to Pete as a
Canadian or a Canadian-based salesman.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you also know the US market probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody is waiting for federal
legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because then first US companies could
export to Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would be a game changer,
I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you expect the chances for this
scenario?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with federally legalization,
it's in discussion right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Safe Banking Act is going to
be a good bridge towards that discussion
[SPEAKER_02]: even further.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think with the Democratic Party that
they're going to use it as a platform for
[SPEAKER_02]: the next election.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would do if I was in
politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really have any promises in
their current foundation to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: look, we're going to legalize it during
this four-year period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not use that as another indication
to say, let's bring in some votes?
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't be Biden because I think he's
going to be too old for the next
[SPEAKER_02]: presidency.
[SPEAKER_02]: But whoever is the next Democratic leader,
using that as a platform to drive
[SPEAKER_02]: additional votes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a little patience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little patience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it will be a game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to drive a lot of investment
capital into the business, a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of institutional funding will
continue to come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since it's federally legal and you can
expense stuff properly, I think that'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: a pretty big game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to start to see even
more capital flood into Europe like we did
[SPEAKER_02]: when it happened in Canada, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just depends on what they decide to
do with that wave of capital and what type
[SPEAKER_02]: of types of business decisions are made in
this international expansion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rudolfi, safe banking is a good keyword
Pete just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: What obstacles can cannabis investors face
when it comes to safe banking,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a very, very big issue,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem with banking is that,
and I think the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is a very good textbook example of that,
even when you set up domestic operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: banks are super hostile to lending you
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if your business is just going to be
in Colorado, you say, look, I just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: set up in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have potential customers in Colorado,
business partners in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to a bank in Colorado and they're
like, yeah, we're going to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is it's not legal
at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only imagine what a bank is going
to tell you if you go to that bank and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, hey, I'm going to expand
internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, I'm going to sell my stuff
in, say, Europe, in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you had told me I'm going to
sell it in Boulder, I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dusseldorf, not so sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the big issues that I
think cannabis companies have to solve
[SPEAKER_00]: right now is the funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are perspectives of hope,
because you can see in Europe that even
[SPEAKER_00]: the EU now is pushing hard toward
legalizing at least CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from the moment you have a harmonized
regulation that covers an entire region,
[SPEAKER_00]: then banks will feel a bit more
comfortable to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, Clifford Chance, historically,
I've got to say, we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: disputes-oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're more regulation-oriented and
transaction-oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the past two years, we've had at least
four or five big banks operating
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally coming to us and asking,
all right, I think I'm getting ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: start opening the green gates,
not cannabis, but the dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know if I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to know on a
country-per-country basis how exactly I
[SPEAKER_00]: can lend money to cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of businesses and what
conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next step would be, if I lend
money to fund cannabis operations in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, then can I lend some more money
to fund that business internationally?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we see at our own level
that there is a shift that is occurring
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's thanks to those politics that
are taken at a broader EU level as opposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to country-per-country level.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still makes it challenging being a
business in this environment and dealing
[SPEAKER_02]: with banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the things, if you're looking
to expand into Germany or open up in
[SPEAKER_02]: Denmark or whatever it may be,
how many North Americans do we have in the
[SPEAKER_02]: room today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so a few.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a Canadian, I had a Canadian business
sold, but while we were operating that
[SPEAKER_02]: Canadian business, I was kicked out of
CIBC, RBC, BMO, and this is legalized
[SPEAKER_02]: federally, and we were still kicked out of
the banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even here in Denmark, or here in
Denmark, or in Germany, in Denmark,
[SPEAKER_02]: Danske Bank didn't want to work with us,
so we had to go to one of the smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: banks, Jeske, or I think that's what it's
called.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Danish friends in here are nodding at
me, so I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, banking is a challenging one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though they might be giving the
thumbs up, they have to do the internal
[SPEAKER_02]: checks and know your customers,
and not even just that, just do they want
[SPEAKER_02]: to deal with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: So making sure that you've got backups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Backup banks, just in case you get kicked
out, all of a sudden, you have nowhere to
[SPEAKER_02]: put your cash to pay your bills and
collect your customer invoices.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that may cause further
problems in the future because cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: money is already there a lot?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you cannot invest with it or deal
legally with it, what are the dangers for
[SPEAKER_05]: the future if that is not solved within a
certain range of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let me say this then,
and I think it expands again on what Pete
[SPEAKER_00]: has mentioned, and what we have touched
upon a bit earlier in our discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing to have a business plan,
contemplating in what jurisdiction you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to set up shop and expand your
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then take Greece, you have plans for
Greece, and then three months later,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh man, change of government, they don't
want to do cannabis anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to find a new place to expand my
operations, but hey, at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, it's fine, I've not invested any
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problems arise is when you have already
poured your money into a place,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have applied for a license,
or even you have a license or a permit to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow the stuff or to manufacture it or to
export it, and a few months, a few years
[SPEAKER_00]: down the line, suddenly then there is a
change of government, and suddenly,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh wait, my license has been taken away,
or I had applied to renew my license,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now the government won't give it to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem is, it's all license-based,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have a license,
you don't have a business, and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have money anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not here to give investment advice in
that, oh, what are the alternatives for
[SPEAKER_00]: you as a business to invest in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to tell you there is a way to get
that money back, or to prevent it from
[SPEAKER_00]: going away, and it's quite simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that you don't know about it,
but I do because it's my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a network of international
investment treaties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been developed after World War II
because everybody wanted to do foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: investment to rebuild Europe, rebuild the
world, so boom, 3,000 treaties in the span
[SPEAKER_00]: of 50 years being concluded by countries
on a one-on-one basis, or on a
[SPEAKER_00]: multilateral basis, but like in the EU,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those treaties are free.
[SPEAKER_00]: By definition, they are treaties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't only concern states,
unlike most treaties, they concern you as
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those treaties give rights to
businesses, and those rights are fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: My right is not to be expropriated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my company taken away by the
government, my license taken away,
[SPEAKER_00]: my IP taken away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a right to be treated fairly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my investment not only cannot be
expropriated, but cannot just play cat and
[SPEAKER_00]: mouse with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot tell me one day, here's the
license, the next day, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm going to give it to
you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, but most importantly,
you have access to an alternate judicial
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I may, just expanding on that
thought, say you invest, and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: take an example of Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit unfair if we've got Spanish
friends here today, but again,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's based on very recent history.
[SPEAKER_00]: You invest in Spain because they
liberalize the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even give you incentives to grow
stuff there because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: space is nice, nice sun, fertile soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do that for five years, you invest
dozens of millions, or a bit less,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a bit more, you know, depending on the
scales of your operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day, Spain wakes up and
realize, oh shit, you know, those
[SPEAKER_00]: incentives, they cost me a lot of money,
and at the end of the day, I don't make
[SPEAKER_00]: that much money out of it, so maybe it's
time to let them go, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, your business model
collapses because it was based on those
[SPEAKER_00]: incentives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you could go to Spain courts,
and you know, the Spain judicial system,
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing it to the French one,
say is roughly similar, it's fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have independent judges, but it's very
slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, cannabis is political.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see in my own country, you know,
home country, France, that not everyone is
[SPEAKER_00]: very happy about the perspective of even
just legalizing CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got people, and not just a few,
like half the people really in France are
[SPEAKER_00]: like, ah, I don't like cannabis,
I don't want to do any of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you go to local courts, and of course
you've got local judges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't pick your judge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to pray that whatever
judge is going to decide your case is sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of okay with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternatively, with an alternate judicial
system, it's called arbitration,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is designed for businesses to pick
their own judges internationally,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's one of the most important
protections you can get under those
[SPEAKER_00]: treaties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good explanation.
[SPEAKER_05]: My next question goes to Pete.
[SPEAKER_05]: Despite we have those problems,
cannabis or medical cannabis stocks are
[SPEAKER_05]: already traded on German stocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are detained in Luxembourg.
[SPEAKER_05]: Luxembourg even changed the medical
cannabis law, so they could continue to
[SPEAKER_05]: detain the stocks, so something moves
also.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as it seems recently, in my eyes,
Germany is becoming the trading place for
[SPEAKER_05]: European medical cannabis, the main
trading place, but the German government
[SPEAKER_05]: does not allow a lot of companies to grow
a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my next question goes out actually to
both panelists.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, which countries will be
the main production countries within
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe over the next years?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's not going to be Germany yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Germany's going to do a high-quality
product, probably a very pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: product, but let's look at Portugal,
Spain, Greece, like when that does get
[SPEAKER_02]: into, but anybody that's close to the
equator where it's much cheaper to grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, it's not exactly the answer you
expect, I guess, Michael, but my answer is
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe Europe is just not going to be a
place where you're going to grow the most
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's part of that evolving
cannabis game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just you may want to seize
opportunities abroad outside Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just you're going to have to
probably, because again, Colombia and
[SPEAKER_00]: Latin America, South Africa, even Morocco,
Thailand, those places have the ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: climate to grow the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the cheapest in terms of labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem again is a matter of
country risk, but we've just addressed
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways to plan ahead of that,
but frankly, if I had to tell you what
[SPEAKER_00]: country I think will be growing the most
stuff in Europe, I would say Morocco,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my next question also goes to you
because you are Australian-based and we
[SPEAKER_05]: never talked about the Australian medical
cannabis program here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it worth to invest in?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or can you invest in the Australian
medical cannabis program?
[SPEAKER_05]: How is that organized there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, Australia has made great
strides over the six to seven years to
[SPEAKER_00]: liberalize their medical cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now it's purely medical and
industrial, no recreational just yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though there are voices already even
at the government level that are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: advocate for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I'd say, a major market in the
making.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few big companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking of Cann Global, Little Green
Pharma that maybe a few of you have heard
[SPEAKER_00]: about because they are making great
strides in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say at the moment what we are seeing
is more like Australian cannabis companies
[SPEAKER_00]: investing outside Australia, primarily in
Southeast Asia, so Thailand, Africa,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Europe than the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible, but I think the trend is
going to be just a bit like Canada and the
[SPEAKER_00]: US, big local companies doing their own
stuff and then trying to export their
[SPEAKER_00]: operations abroad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pete, do you have any, because you're
doing extraction in Denmark, do you
[SPEAKER_05]: exclusively extract flowers that were
grown in Denmark or do you also operate
[SPEAKER_05]: with flowers that were grown out of the
European community?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a possibility?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the next fun part about
navigating government regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now in Denmark, they're not
allowing for bulk import.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can import products into Denmark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the three products that are actually in
the Danish medical system available for
[SPEAKER_02]: patients, Bedrikan has three strains of
their flower and Aurora has a gel capsule
[SPEAKER_02]: that's coming out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually nothing has been produced in
Denmark.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now the regulations don't allow
me to take in flower from, say,
[SPEAKER_02]: Macedonia, bring that into Denmark,
process it, and then send it back out,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where some of the political
navigation comes into play.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same instance, there's lots of
cultivation happening in Denmark and some
[SPEAKER_02]: really high quality product right now,
which is great for us to be able to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with those groups.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you, what do you think,
how long will that take until,
[SPEAKER_05]: because within the EU, it's actually no
problem, but how long will it take till
[SPEAKER_05]: the market is open to other medical
cannabis markets, which is, except Canada,
[SPEAKER_05]: still very complicated?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long till the Danish market is open?
[SPEAKER_02]: The European market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the European market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, yeah, it's anybody's guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really, I could sit here and try to be
a fortune teller with it, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody's guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what it's really gonna take is
just proof, proof that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis coming from other markets is
meeting that standard of quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's a flower or whether if it's a
concentrate and however it's being
[SPEAKER_02]: formulated from there, it comes back down
to quality and that level of quality and
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't meet the medical systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take a look at the pharmaceutical
industry outside of cannabis, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical drugs that have their raw
ingredients that are manufactured all over
[SPEAKER_02]: the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then those are making their way into
Europe to be further processed and then
[SPEAKER_02]: dropped into Germany or Denmark or France
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: The infrastructure is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The euphoric substance licenses allow for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's actually, it's just really just
proving out quality and then just
[SPEAKER_02]: following the little pathways that are
already established within the pharma
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're talking about things like GMP and
my next question to Rudolfi, because you
[SPEAKER_05]: just mentioned the cannabis market in
Thailand, the medical market.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also read a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did some research that it's existing
already.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is no fake news or so.
[SPEAKER_05]: The medical cannabis market is already
existing in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also read it's kind of on a private
level or do they know something about GMP
[SPEAKER_05]: and like professional production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, look, I think it's fair to say that
the cannabis market in Thailand,
[SPEAKER_00]: the legal one, is fairly new in a way that
I think still in the process of developing
[SPEAKER_00]: their regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we only have a few instances,
examples of companies from Australia say
[SPEAKER_00]: investing in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know to what extent we're really
looking at GML and all that stuff at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment precisely because it's still in the
making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly about Thailand, it's new but
it's not so new because it started in 2018
[SPEAKER_00]: when the government said to say,
okay, okay, okay, we're gonna liberalize
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The following year, the government decided
to take away all the patents for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-based medicine that were being
developed by US and Japanese companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine their reaction when they
were told, oh, we're gonna stop all the
[SPEAKER_00]: foreign patents on cannabis because you're
foreigners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, no, no,
no, okay, okay, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna make it real and boom,
they really liberalized the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was early 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, opportunities, but I think we're
not quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not comparable to the regulations we
have in Europe at all, let alone in
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, word of the wise, interesting
market, full opportunities, but just gotta
[SPEAKER_00]: be a bit careful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: My next question to Pete is more
Europe-specific because we all know you
[SPEAKER_05]: export, you sell most of your products to
Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any other European countries
you're already exporting to or is there
[SPEAKER_05]: anything you expect that you have other
countries?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you already have a medical
program, but they are not as big as in
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany, what do you think is next?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more on the expectations,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the various cultivators that we're
working with and then just helping get
[SPEAKER_02]: their product to other countries,
we're seeing flour from Denmark being sent
[SPEAKER_02]: to Australia and New Zealand, Germany,
flour is going over to Poland now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's markets available.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our eyes open for just markets
that have an established rec.
[SPEAKER_02]: medical program, an established program
where, hey, they're either pointing to the
[SPEAKER_02]: German monograph or they're pointing to
something that says that we accept this
[SPEAKER_02]: type of product.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the sense of international business,
as a small business trying to go in at a
[SPEAKER_02]: government level and try to burn your own
path, it's very, very expensive,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We always find it's better to find the
local specialists, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to find distributors in Poland
or Czech Republic or Spain or Portugal,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's really, you know, as you talk about
expectations, that's where we're at right
[SPEAKER_02]: now as an organization is finding those
specialists.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's any out there, hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, yeah, finding those
specialists that say, look, we need
[SPEAKER_02]: product in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're a distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the type of organization that we
want to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just makes from an international
business perspective, it makes us not have
[SPEAKER_02]: to be experts in every single market.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we can do is just rely on strategic
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes the business actually run a
lot faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my next question goes to Rodolfi.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't talk about South America yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I think back in 2013, Uruguay was the
first country worldwide to legalize
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis and medical cannabis,
both as I know, Argentina legalized,
[SPEAKER_05]: Colombia legalized.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only player that is mentioned
sometimes is Colombia.
[SPEAKER_05]: But not Argentina, not Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's also more rumors coming from
Colombia, but no product so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's in South America?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the expectations for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure I have an explanation for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do, I guess, in the case of
Uruguay, they were the first adopters,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first movers, so that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they still have a very small economy
compared even just to Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even more so Argentina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Argentina, not too sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, they have an interesting
history of treating foreign investments in
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the early 2000s, that might make
more than just a few businesses a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: reluctant to dive in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I certainly understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One country I've not mentioned,
though, Michael, is Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very interesting case,
I think, because it was all over the news
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, Mexico is going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Canada was shaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh my god, they're going to
take over the lead in the Americas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're still waiting to see it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's happening now thanks to the
courts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as it happened elsewhere before that
we know of in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is certainly going to be a huge
market from the moment it opens up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly it will open up to foreign
capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my eyes right now are turned
toward Mexico, because I expect they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to end up opening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the moment where it's already
legal, probably Colombia takes it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: For now, at least.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Colombia is also, I've heard a lot,
seen a little.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know anything about the Colombian
cannabis market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was to you, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Colombia, like we just saw the news and
analysis, where Colombia should be
[SPEAKER_02]: allowing or is allowing now for the export
of flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be game changing for
the organizations that have invested into
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, just trying to navigate those rules
and regulations and do some political
[SPEAKER_02]: advocacy to make changes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're seeing those changes happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just chatting with a group the other
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually saying that they're
seeing some remunitions or some policies
[SPEAKER_02]: that are starting to be put into place to
allow for more of a localized market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, I see a lot of the South
American companies looking to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: just supply down in South America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brazil is starting to become a market
where it's consuming medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the investors into our company is
out of Brazil slash Toronto.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also have an investment into a
distribution company in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're looking for product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a growing market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually very cool to see what's
happening there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think maybe they might be looking to
more, I shouldn't say localized,
[SPEAKER_02]: but onto that, just supplying their
continent right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: As many of those companies have struggled,
some of them have gotten the EU GMP stamp
[SPEAKER_02]: and certification, but many have struggled
to get that level of certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not ship to a more localized market
where it's less expensive for shipping?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the market is growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get a foothold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's cool to see what's happening down
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rudolfi, my very last question goes out to
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We heard about a lot of countries now who
are planning to open up for cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: investments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my very last question is from the
perspective of the consumer, of the
[SPEAKER_05]: patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of those countries also have a
medical law or a medical program that
[SPEAKER_05]: works for the patients already?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do they first settle up the investments
and then make the program or open program
[SPEAKER_05]: for the patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there is a tendency in running
trials before putting it to the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly the case in France where
right now we're conducting trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: active ones, and the products being
supplied are in part from Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at Thailand, it's a bit
the same, at least officially.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea, when you liberalize the medical
cannabis industry, is still to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: precautionary approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to make products
accessible to all the patients right away
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't know what the products are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think in most jurisdictions certainly
still that are developing their medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis market, the goal first is to have
a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where foreign companies come
into the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they share their know-how that they
have already accumulated in other
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in a second step, when the
government is sort of happy with the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of the product and has some
guarantees, as Pete was saying earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: the need to see guarantees, then the
opening up to the patients and to the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical profession as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still a two-stage process in most
instances, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was crystal clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see we're nearly out of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we should open or should open
the question out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So any questions in the audience?
[SPEAKER_05]: Anthony?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying not to be shy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the panel and for the good
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a first-timer here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm very happy to be here and join you
all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a pharmaceuticals background.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been working all my life in
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see these trends as very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the one hand, I have questions because,
you know, pharmaceuticals of large
[SPEAKER_04]: companies tend to synthesize natural
products eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard any word on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the whole meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if that is a ghost that
is out there or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so far or not so recent future.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not my subject.
[SPEAKER_04]: My subject is I'm a German citizen living
here in Berlin, but I represent two
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombian companies that sell CBD and CBG.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm very happy that we heard for the
first time in more detail about Latin
[SPEAKER_04]: America.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have good news.
[SPEAKER_04]: Panama has just gone through legalizing
medical cannabis yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to sign off the bill next
week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think after Panama, all of Central
America will continue because it's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: a halo effect for the other countries as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know that Panama has a very large
free trade zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are very, very capable of
exporting into the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are very interested as companies to
come into Europe, European market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I find it being new to this market,
I find it very difficult to make contact.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anybody is interested in making a
contact with Colombian companies,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so really more of a statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the nice statement.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Gaio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I on?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just take off my mask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Javier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from Resin Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a Spanish seed bank, creators of
Kanatonic, ACDC, and some of the first CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: strains to be out in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're doing a lot of consulting work
in Thailand and now in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually Mexican, so I have a little
bit of perspective on what's going on
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Thailand, as you mentioned,
we're working with Golden Triangle Group,
[SPEAKER_03]: Asia's premier leading cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will have EU certification flowers
available in Europe by spring of 2022.
[SPEAKER_03]: And medicinal cannabis oils will be
released and sold exclusively by the
[SPEAKER_03]: government authority, by the Thai
government called the GPO.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they will be selling their oils in
Europe in winter of this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Thailand already is starting with the
UGMP certification.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexico, the biggest problem in delays
there are with the politicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an inept government.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been totally unable to fight
against the cartels.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just let the cartels do whatever
they want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the same vein, they're unable to
push forward with legislation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The courts are on the side of the
legislation of cannabis, but the
[SPEAKER_03]: politicians are still not able to pull
themselves together and push anything
[SPEAKER_03]: forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a massive expectation in local
national capitalists that are waiting to
[SPEAKER_03]: invest in Mexico, but they're all waiting
for a little bit more clarity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really no vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way to push forward at present.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's still completely in the cloud.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not really much clarity for you,
but it's going to happen when it... Thank
[SPEAKER_03]: you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we maybe come to the next question to
the panelists?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're here to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to take that question?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a statement and an update,
but soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soon we'll get a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, this is probably the last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an actual question.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the current situation for the
cannabis in Australia for Rudolph?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The current situation for cannabis in
Australia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a...
[SPEAKER_00]: Developing market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is making strides on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got, I think, at least a dozen
Australian stock exchange listed companies
[SPEAKER_00]: now, which is quite impressive because,
again, it's fairly recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not all states have liberalized at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal government came around the
idea just a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been growing fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like in other parts of the world,
there's been a little bit of a bubble,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the stocks have stagnated for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've got those main, like two,
three main cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really thinking of Little Green
Pharma, Cann Global, and a couple others
[SPEAKER_00]: that now really have established proper
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still not a massive consumer market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting there because of the,
you know, the Aussie way of life,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're all surfing, and wellness,
and all that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not too sure whether it is a target
destination right now for foreign cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, again, I think what's happening
is they are growing their own companies
[SPEAKER_00]: locally, and those companies already have
started to invest abroad because,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, of the growing cost and
manufacturing costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see it more as an outward cannabis
destination than an inbound or inward one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much the state of the
affairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got more and more people at the
politician level that are pushing for
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis to be legalized,
and that's in the wake of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: that are still revered in Australia due to
their relationship in the Commonwealth,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're getting there,
and certainly, you know, Aussies do smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: pot, and not just because of headaches or
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is potential, but it's not as
fast moving on that specific front as it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be in other jurisdictions,
I guess, to be perfectly fair and
[SPEAKER_00]: transparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not too sure we're going to see
them anytime soon, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to be aware they have a funny
relationship to vice stuff in Australia
[SPEAKER_00]: because, like, pot is okay somehow,
but cigarettes are like $25 a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's not a clear-cut market,
and no, I'm not so sure we're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: specialty shops very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have hopes, but just not for tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Rodolfi, and we're really
running out of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Pete.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Rodolfi, for your expertise.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks a lot for listening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, the three of you.
