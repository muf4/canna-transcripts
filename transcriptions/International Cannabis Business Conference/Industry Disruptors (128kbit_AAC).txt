[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy 420, everyone, from San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our panel's about disruption, everything
that we've had to do to get where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, Ashley, one of our panelists,
said, like, not only are we industry
[SPEAKER_03]: disruptors, our industry's being
disrupted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to talk a bit about that,
too, how the cannabis industry's actually
[SPEAKER_03]: being disrupted and disrupting,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my name's Debbie Goldsberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in the cannabis industry for 30
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the CEO of Magnolia Wellness
Dispensary in Oakland, and I'm the Chief
[SPEAKER_03]: Compliance Officer for High Fidelity
Dispensary in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please come visit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a vape lounge at Magnolia,
so you can actually try the samples if you
[SPEAKER_03]: want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been a disruptor from day one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing we had to do, of course,
is disrupt prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to tell the DEA and the police and
the elected officials that this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: democracy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The voters run the democracy, that the
government's supposed to make laws based
[SPEAKER_03]: on facts and science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they don't, we the people take
charge of the democracy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on cannabis prohibition, they had
failed us epically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, prohibition was illegal,
and our acts were what needed to be done
[SPEAKER_03]: to, as Jack Herrera said so eloquently all
those years, make sure that hemp can save
[SPEAKER_03]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been very excited to be a part of
this movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: My own activism, I've ran two local
marijuana initiatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran a recount.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ever get a chance to demand a
recount, it is just as fun as you can
[SPEAKER_03]: imagine to demand a recount.
[SPEAKER_03]: We won the recount.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a referendum in San Jose when they
passed a law trying to make marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a referendum.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if the city passes a law,
you can undo that as a citizen using the
[SPEAKER_03]: referendum process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was subpoenaed by the feds to testify
against Ed Rosenthal in his federal trial
[SPEAKER_03]: and refused.
[SPEAKER_03]: Went to federal court in front of Judge
Breyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who said the refusal has been brought into
my court with such dignity and care.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can see that when people have
strong views of these intense issues,
[SPEAKER_03]: that they can come into federal courts and
make their case in a way that's
[SPEAKER_03]: intelligent and comprehensive and matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he congratulated us and rather than
making us testify, set us free.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I opened my first dispensary, Berkeley
Patients Group, in 1999.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it was the right thing to do,
not the legal thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now at Magnolia Wellness, I've been
involved in a turnaround project for those
[SPEAKER_03]: people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, our industry is 20 years old in
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: People like me, if we've made it this far,
it's been tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're in debt and we've struggled and
a lot of us went to jail and we've
[SPEAKER_03]: suffered.
[SPEAKER_03]: We probably all have post-traumatic stress
disorder from having to fight the feds and
[SPEAKER_03]: fight our government and deal with our
families and face the stigma of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been in prohibition all these years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis can help with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke them if you got them, not here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at Magnolia, I've been involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took over Magnolia.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to get in the cannabis
industry in California now at retail,
[SPEAKER_03]: really the only way in is acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took over Magnolia like one of the many
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was seven figures in debt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been working on a turnaround project
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So close, so close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't wait to finish this turnaround
project and start sleeping at night again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll get there one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, I'm still on the mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp can save the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we're all here for that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've known Alex Rogers, the guy who puts
on this conference for almost 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we're building a business,
but we're also building a community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we really are trying to make a nicer
society through the legalization of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that in mind, we've got a panel of
disruptors from a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_03]: fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a really, I think, exciting panel
planned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so just let me introduce the
panelists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I will turn it right over to the
first speaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, we have Zach Darling right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zach is a marketing guy from a hybrid
collective doing a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll introduce him in a moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Lance.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Lance from Boveda.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, Lance comes from the online
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the former GM of marijuana.com and
a number of different companies that I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: tell you about.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got Ashley down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ashley is a little lawyer and also in the
banking industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking forward to find out what is
coming up for banking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have Vinu down there at the
end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this guy's such a badass lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not even going to believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an east coaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's still doing criminal defense.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are being arrested for cannabis out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they still are here to some
degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to make sure that our industry
stays safe and we're going to legalize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the meantime, we're going to keep
people out of jail while we do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with no further ado, let me introduce
my first panelist here, which is Zach
[SPEAKER_03]: Darling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I love this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the CEO, the chief eternal optimist
of his company.
[SPEAKER_03]: He founded the hybrid collective.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a full creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the hybrid creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zach is from the hybrid creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because the collective should be a
dispensary, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's your opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: He founded the hybrid creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a full service design and development
marketing company.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do branding.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do identity.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do package design.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do packaging, website development,
marketing tools, and much, much more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Zach, take it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's everybody doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned, as was mentioned,
I'm the chief eternal optimist at the
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the top creative agency for
cannabis ventures here in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States and soon to be international.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been in business for about nine
years working within the hydroponics
[SPEAKER_02]: industry before cannabis became overt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was raised on a hippie commune by pot
farmers in the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could say I'm second generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we started this panel, I really
felt like I wanted to just identify,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, what does it mean to be a disruptor?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a buzzword in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here in San Francisco and the dot com
world and Silicon Valley, it's definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: an overused buzzword.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does it mean for us in the
cannabis industry and for us as
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals to be disruptors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when I was a hippie kid,
I got kicked out of the Waldorf school and
[SPEAKER_02]: I got kicked out of the other hippie
school because I was always a disruptive
[SPEAKER_02]: child.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned the value of attention
through disruption.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, maybe that wasn't the most positive
thing because it ended me up in public
[SPEAKER_02]: school where I learned discipline.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a valuable lesson in how we can
challenge the status quo of what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on in any given moment and then all of a
sudden divert attention to what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis in itself is a disruptive
industry, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have disrupted the world on such a
tremendous fundamental basis from the
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol industry, from prohibition,
from legality, from conservative agendas,
[SPEAKER_02]: from what law enforcement has been telling
us, from misinformed propaganda.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis turned that entire world on its
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every one of us, every one of you is a
disruptor by just being a part of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's part of the reason we love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're excited about it because it's
purpose-driven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purpose-driven brands, purpose-driven
businesses, purpose-driven industries are
[SPEAKER_02]: creating change and people love being a
part of change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by its very nature, being a disruptor,
it's valuable for us to be involved and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's exciting for us to be involved with
this because we're challenging the way
[SPEAKER_02]: things work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the way things work, we're wrong
and we all agree about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we're in this situation where
we're inventing a new industry in a world
[SPEAKER_02]: that had never existed really before
because it had been driven in the black
[SPEAKER_02]: market and now we're disrupting ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at what's happening in
various, how many small mom and pops do
[SPEAKER_02]: you know that are out of business right
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because things have changed so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way things were, we're becoming an
internally disruptive industry within
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is presenting new challenges for
every entrepreneur and business person and
[SPEAKER_02]: venture as big money and big multi-state
operators and hugely capitalized
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses are starting to crush a lot of
the smaller brands and smaller businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: That disruption is causing people to need
to consolidate, come together and bond and
[SPEAKER_02]: create collectives and communities through
distribution networks or what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have so much to say on this matter
and I'm looking forward to this panel with
[SPEAKER_02]: these incredible people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you for having me and I'm
looking forward to the talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it for Zach.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hybrid creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us, what do you guys do over there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed on your website you really have
a lot of killer brands that you represent
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're doing a great job getting them
seen in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are you representing?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how are you guys being disruptive over
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, well we are, like I said,
we're the premier creative agency for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis ventures.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've launched and taken to market some of
the biggest brands here in California
[SPEAKER_02]: especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: In January our agency was acquired by
Cushco Holdings, previously Cush Bottles,
[SPEAKER_02]: which has really empowered our agency to
create our dream of being the
[SPEAKER_02]: international cannabis agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to basically understand what
marketing and compliance means in every
[SPEAKER_02]: existing and emerging cannabis market
globally to where when people are ready to
[SPEAKER_02]: take their brands global, we're obviously
the agency to go to because we truly know
[SPEAKER_02]: what that means on a cultural level as
well as a legal compliance level.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the brands that we work
with is Bang, one of the sponsors of this
[SPEAKER_02]: event, and I take my hat off to them
because they were disruptors in the very
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: When nobody was becoming multi-state,
when nobody actually was being bold enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to be relicensing their brand across state
lines, Bang was already vastly ahead of it
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's part of the reason they've
become such a household name in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my other clients that I would say
has done a fantastic job of being
[SPEAKER_02]: disruptive is Cannacraft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolute Extracts makes a bond agreement
with Lagunitas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come out with two products.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is a line of cannabis extracts that
are infused with hop terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it tastes like you're vaping an IPA but
there's no alcohol in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're bringing that terpene profile
flavor into the experience and then on the
[SPEAKER_02]: opposite side, they're using cannabis
terpenes to make an IPA taste like,
[SPEAKER_02]: to taste like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's innovative.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's really the root of what
disruption means.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not novelty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say things like double barrel is
novelty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's chachki.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay, fine, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take two things, make them work together
but true innovation is taking something
[SPEAKER_02]: completely different and changing the
status quo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pavita is a perfect example, fitting that
niche that needed to be fit, finding that
[SPEAKER_02]: spot and then changing the industry and
dominating their portion of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, everything at the root of what
we do is in strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of good looking brands out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a high quality brand or a
consistent brand, then you are what we,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what we call a minimum standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to radically
differentiate your brand and as we call
[SPEAKER_02]: it, zag in the industry is where you're
not another sheep in the herd because your
[SPEAKER_02]: main competitor is not another cannabis
brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's brand noise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's brand clutter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we do as a creative agency
through all the variety of full spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: tools from web development to design,
marketing, packaging, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole spectrum, we help you find your
zag.
[SPEAKER_02]: We help you determine how you can
radically differentiate your brand and
[SPEAKER_02]: rise above the noise of the industry and
all the other brands that are out there
[SPEAKER_02]: vying for attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely recommend that you take a
look at the website for the hybrid
[SPEAKER_03]: creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned a lot on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also you can see what a good looking
brand looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can learn more, of course,
about the work that zag does.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so entertaining and so charming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to be here with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our next speaker is Ashley Elsner.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is a CEO and founder of Artery Inc and
Green Market Bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ashley is a financial expert.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's an expert in financial services and
technology for the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_03]: She works in digital payments,
banking alternatives and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ashley, are you going to save us this
banking issue?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's turn it over to Ashley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for that introduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is far more than I deserve.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope very much that there will be more
movement by traditional institutions into
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I disagree on where the actual motivation
comes for them staying out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having worked with quite a few financial
services firms in the past, I am aware of
[SPEAKER_04]: the conservative nature of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for good reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to make sure that the economy
remains stable and is something that is
[SPEAKER_04]: available to everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there are situations that cause
them to shut down, they don't want to have
[SPEAKER_04]: that happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are opportunities for them to do
well in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also opportunities for them to
fall into pits with this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are a lot of things that need to
change in order for them to get
[SPEAKER_04]: comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are working towards pushing them
towards accepting more services,
[SPEAKER_04]: being able to use our services to accept
more cannabis accounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Following Zach is just really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to put the charming marketing guy
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize he was going to
intimidate the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Banking is the number one most pain in the
ass problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the reason behind all of the crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the challenges, all of the dark
side of cannabis comes from banking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to be willing to tackle and jump on
something like that and take that on as
[SPEAKER_02]: the focus of your business, to me,
feels like it's bold, it's innovative,
[SPEAKER_02]: and therefore, should you be the one
that's successful?
[SPEAKER_02]: Highly disruptive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever cracks this code is going to be
the one that saves the day for the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've cracked it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is my background, actually,
is financial services law.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was with Sidley Austin for several years
in their financial regulatory group out in
[SPEAKER_04]: New York City.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked for Bessemer Venture Partners and
Legal and Operations.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is my second fintech, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: My first fintech was an online hedge fund
investment platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was back in 2011 before that space
got crowded.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did fine in that, but nobody invests in
fintech, frankly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not one of those spaces where
institutional investors like to invest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that that's a familiar thing that
many people in this industry have also had
[SPEAKER_04]: to deal with is a lack of institutional
support.
[SPEAKER_04]: Banking itself is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of regulations around it,
and doing it wrong, you go to prison,
[SPEAKER_04]: period.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of those things where people also
don't recognize that payments is another
[SPEAKER_04]: space that you can get into pitfalls with.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are technologies that are usable for
this, our banking industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would argue that our product is less
disruptive for this space.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just frankly a necessity for this
space, and more disruptive for traditional
[SPEAKER_04]: banking services and traditional payments.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a rail that frankly could replace
ACH.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could replace Fedwire.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're seeing that actually in a lot of
locations across the globe, and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: has actually been very slow to adopt
financial technologies that could be very
[SPEAKER_04]: attractive for banking, and frankly are no
brainers when you start actually looking
[SPEAKER_04]: at the technology themselves, and what
they're currently using.
[SPEAKER_04]: But our disruption, the disruption that we
provide, and as you can tell, I'm really a
[SPEAKER_04]: background person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm disrupting things on the B2B side.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm interested in providing the options
for people to use as an alternative to
[SPEAKER_04]: bank owned rails, or federal government
owned rails.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that provides an additional
layer of security because you don't end up
[SPEAKER_04]: being closed out of the system,
which is controlled frankly by a few
[SPEAKER_04]: small, not small, large, but just a few
corporate players.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ugly truth about this is that the
majority of state banks and smaller
[SPEAKER_04]: institutions, regional banks, they're
licensing their rails from the larger
[SPEAKER_04]: institutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: That means that they have to be careful
what they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to support the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of them are affected by this
themselves, but they also have to comply
[SPEAKER_04]: with both regulation, of course,
but I think that the government has been
[SPEAKER_04]: more supportive to trying to bring
financial institutions on board,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the financial industry itself has been
very cautious in moving in because they
[SPEAKER_04]: are...
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a circular argument.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are in cash, so it means you're
more likely to money launder, and we don't
[SPEAKER_04]: wanna be handling money laundering,
but it's like, okay, well, but the cash
[SPEAKER_04]: piece, the only reason why we're in cash
is because you guys refuse to bank us,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so this ends up being the circular...
Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: This silly argument that frankly has this
circular format to it that really doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have a whole lot of logic, and it is
fixable, and frankly, I put it upon the
[SPEAKER_04]: financial institutions themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is their responsibility within our
society to actually monitor these
[SPEAKER_04]: transactions, that they have a privileged
place in our society, and they need to
[SPEAKER_04]: live up to that privilege, so that is what
we're trying to help them do, get them
[SPEAKER_04]: more comfortable with it, and also get
them more comfortable with financial
[SPEAKER_04]: technology that they are also not really
that well up on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ashley, Green Market Bank... Sorry to get
the weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green Market Bank is focused on providing
business banking services to the marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it that you guys do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, Green Market Bank was my old
trade name while I was learning this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that I wanted to solve the banking
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that there was a problem with
payments as well, and was trying to take a
[SPEAKER_04]: two-pronged approach to the cash problem
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Artery is our product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Artery Pay is our website, and what we are
doing we are working with banking
[SPEAKER_04]: institutions, some of the smaller
institutions that, like I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: have been limited in their ability to work
with this industry because of either lack
[SPEAKER_04]: of capacity or concern about whether they
were gonna lose the licenses on their ACH
[SPEAKER_04]: and Fedwire rails, concern about whether
they were going to, yes, possibly get into
[SPEAKER_04]: trouble for working with this industry on
a legal basis, although I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: them have sort of moved away from that
expectation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to work with them and get
them comfortable with it, and so what we
[SPEAKER_04]: do is we do know your customer,
we do anti-money laundering reporting,
[SPEAKER_04]: all of this compliance that they have to
do anyways.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an added layer of compliance,
and then we provide this back-channel,
[SPEAKER_04]: separate distributed ledger.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are using blockchain with smart
contracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no fluctuation in the value of
any of the contracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: The capital in is the capital out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It represents your contract to the
underlying dollars that are held in trust
[SPEAKER_04]: on your behalf.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no shenanigans.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not trying to build something that
is going to be outside of the banking
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that we need their help.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no way to do this without them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, they have a privileged place
in our society.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are our transaction rails,
and we need them to work with us in order
[SPEAKER_04]: to make this work, and so we are working
with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are working with banking partners.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I can't tell you I'm under NDA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't tell you who, but we have banking
partners here in California, and they are
[SPEAKER_04]: holding capital for our members.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are allowing us to handle the
transactive rails on that behalf,
[SPEAKER_04]: but basically, we're PayPal on blockchain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very simple system.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a ledger that is closed.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no exchange trading, but it allows
transactions to move seamlessly and
[SPEAKER_04]: instantaneously using the newest and most
secure technology that's available for
[SPEAKER_04]: transaction processing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a new age in financial technology,
and the US will be adapting a little more
[SPEAKER_04]: slowly than the rest of the world that had
some enabling regulations come into play,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they will eventually have to adopt
this as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our disruption may be more towards the
banking industry and more towards the
[SPEAKER_04]: credit card industry than actually towards
cannabis, because what we want to do,
[SPEAKER_04]: as Artery implies, is provide you with
that lifeblood and make it safer for
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody to transact in this space,
transact with one another as well as
[SPEAKER_04]: transact with your customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Ashley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear for Ashley the passion that
she's bringing to this issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot imagine how difficult it is to be
where you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So disrupting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to disrupt the media and
marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to get ahead in the banking
industry and financial services.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got so much that we have to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next speaker I'm going to introduce is
Lance Lambert.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the strategic business unit manager.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a mouthful, by the way,
of Boveda, which I use on a regular basis,
[SPEAKER_03]: my dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to keep our cannabis fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: The product is actually very innovative
and useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It keeps the cannabis just shelf-ready and
great for our consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he has a background that's so diverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Lance comes from media.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the past 12 years, he's worked
primarily in the .com and digital media
[SPEAKER_03]: space.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's worked for several big companies,
including Scripps, the cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: Weedmaps.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was actually the director of media
operations and the publisher of marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: .com.
[SPEAKER_03]: He became a part of the industry in 2013,
really, when he joined up with the Denver
[SPEAKER_03]: Post, where he was the director of ad
operations and the GM of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Lance recently took over a position
there at Boveda.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us more about the product,
about yourself, about the disruption that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're causing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The further I get in my career,
the longer my title gets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I lost my voice yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so as far as disrupting,
it's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been a better part of my life for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did spend several years in the digital
media space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And was a part of .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: First started disrupting, I'd say,
with autotrailer.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided to disrupt, well, Chip Perry,
the founder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we decided to disrupt the automotive
industry as far as how you find cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the early years back when I think
Craigslist was the only option outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: print publications.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, yeah, just continued that on in
my career.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as disrupting in this specific
industry, it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working for Scripps Media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which you all might know if you're
familiar with Food Network DIY,
[SPEAKER_01]: those kind of companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's who I worked for and then got
called by a former VP to move to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was January of 2014 when I
officially moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was funny being from Northern
California by where the Waldo's came from
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Marin County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my VP said, hey, I think there's a
good opportunity here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado happens to be legalizing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, I heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's all, you know, you've done some
great things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're launching a website called The
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a brainchild of a friend called
Ricardo Bacca, who was my editor-in-chief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And went over there to head up media
operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was a guy behind the scene of The
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that that was a disruptor to this
industry, and I'm not knocking,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: The media pool, as we call it in this
industry, is very tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have a couple individuals in
this very room that are in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're all friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all respected, you know,
while High Times was, Matt Stang and the
[SPEAKER_01]: crew were kind of more on the deep end,
a little more cultural, a little less
[SPEAKER_01]: mainstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have other companies like Dope and
Eugenio at Cannabis Now, and the list goes
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we came along with The Cannabis,
we wanted to take a different approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to cover the industry from a
true professional journalism standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: We followed what was called SPJ,
or what is called SPJ Code of Ethics,
[SPEAKER_01]: a society of professional journalists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we covered the good, the bad,
and the ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when companies, not naming any names,
but that first year had a thousand plants
[SPEAKER_01]: seized because of exposure to pesticides,
we covered that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When edible companies were off by,
I don't know, 90 milligrams of THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: what was deemed 100 milligram bar,
we covered that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't necessarily make a lot of
friends, but the people who were doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: right in this industry respected us,
because we were covering the good,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bad, the ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were pointing out the people that
weren't doing it right and weren't doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry a service, and then
obviously rewarded and complimented and
[SPEAKER_01]: covered the ones that were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was definitely a fun stint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did move on to become director of media
operations at Weedmaps and become
[SPEAKER_01]: publisher of their subsequent news site,
marijuana.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say another disruptor in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love them or hate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They definitely have made quite a splash
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been around 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a good ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then segue it over, which I think
Debbie came up to the booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, okay, you're in digital media
and you're in .com and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you came to Boveda.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, you know, after Weedmaps,
I kind of decided I wanted to be my own
[SPEAKER_01]: boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd start a few companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like this guy over here, I was like,
you know, I know enough people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to know some key players.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was going to go off on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Boveda approached me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenomenal company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge fan of theirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're similar to other companies I work
for where they're an industry leader and a
[SPEAKER_01]: disruptor in their own right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might ask what they disrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Boveda, I'd say, you know, slowly we're
disrupting the sales of tortillas,
[SPEAKER_01]: of recycling orange rinds and lettuce,
maybe some wet paper towels, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like me, back in my childhood years up
here in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really it is, joking aside,
you know, the technology can be looked at
[SPEAKER_01]: in many perspectives, but really Boveda is
a technology company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I compare it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love speaking to metaphors and
analogies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this guy coming from media will
appreciate because that's how you help
[SPEAKER_01]: people understand what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like taking your clothes down to
the river when you have a washing machine
[SPEAKER_01]: in the garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like seriously, people, it's time to get
with the tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put down the tortillas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put down the wet paper towels.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a safer way to not only store but
to carry your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry as a whole, I'm a huge
advocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't consider myself an advocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do an activist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is more so an advocacy of being cancer
free for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I transitioned my life to being a true
believer of holistic and Eastern medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely believe the cannabis falls
under that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am a big fan of everyone that is a
disruptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you started touching on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of outside disruptors,
a lot of inside disruptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not everyone can look underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's definitely sheep out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a good example is everyone loves
talking about big pharma, big alcohol,
[SPEAKER_01]: big tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They own property in all the prime
locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with someone most people
might not know, but you may recognize a
[SPEAKER_01]: name, Adolphus Bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adolphus Bush, the fit, happens to be the
great, great grandson of Adolphus who
[SPEAKER_01]: started a little company called
Anheuser-Busch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got bought out by a company called
InBev for several billion dollars a few
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when first hearing of it,
I'd be possibly working with someone at
[SPEAKER_01]: Bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big fan of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I skim and hurt myself surfing or
something, I definitely use alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more so topically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for anything both medical and
recreationally, I'm more so a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hearing his story and hearing this
individual speak, and he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting thing happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: This parent company bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought out my family company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the contingency was that no Bush
could work for Anheuser-Busch ever again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of an interesting fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think someone with the last name
Bush is that big alcohol that's coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: to besiege on our industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But number two, he pointed out an obvious,
which all came together in conversation,
[SPEAKER_01]: was he's doing the same thing that his
great, great grandfather did.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's coming in since he did get,
because he went through college.
[SPEAKER_01]: He due process.
[SPEAKER_01]: He tried to go back to his family's,
former family's company.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went through the proper steps to apply
for a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, nope, the stipulation still
stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: No Bush will ever work for this company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did he do?
[SPEAKER_01]: He moved to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started his own company in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, dude, props to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: ABV is the company he started.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I'm doing the same thing my
great, great grandpa did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is so cool that,
you know, if you look at things and you
[SPEAKER_01]: just step back and look at not just the
trees, but the forest as a whole,
[SPEAKER_01]: and look at this individual as he's
disrupting 2.0 for a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so same thing, I think, with other
aspects of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone in pharma is bad pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone in tobacco is bad tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to be open-minded and understand
that some things are inevitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we want this, it's a catch-22.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't have our cake and eat it,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, growing up in Marin County,
although I made fun of hippies because the
[SPEAKER_01]: patchouli always got to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a huge respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've come around to hummus and
10-grain bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly do have a respect for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we want this to go mainstream,
we need the help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to find those partners and get
those alliances in place, but make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that they carry through the culture and
the craft that has been around for
[SPEAKER_01]: decades, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the thing that we really
need to be cognizant of.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter if you're an activist,
if you're an advocate, or if you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the green closet like me,
it all matters in making a difference and
[SPEAKER_01]: moving this industry forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of us, to your point, we're all
disruptors in this room just for being a
[SPEAKER_01]: part of this and maybe posting up on
social media that you came.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very articulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, here's a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: You come from this broad perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in consumer goods right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You came from tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: How has tech changed the way the industry
cures stores and sells cannabis products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wrote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many different levels, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, long live the turkey bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing I'm waiting for change
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've done some extensive studies,
and there's so much more to a turkey bag
[SPEAKER_01]: that I talk about not taking a book by its
cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get why so many of my friends use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the technology, I think I'd
say one company, just as an example on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cure side, CureTube, which is an up and
coming group out of San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, traditionally, anyone that knows
or anyone that has friends in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, we talk about black and yellows
or HDXs or totes or whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people, even when using
turkey bags store in totes, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: the most advantageous way to go,
no matter if it's curing or storing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're awkward.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bulky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You load them all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You load them all down, never mind the
fact that they weigh several pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then these guys come along with something
that does make sense, that's easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: roll, that's easier to check, that's
easier to go through the curing process
[SPEAKER_01]: with as far as venting and such and
burping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they were smart enough to go,
you know, we want technology that matches
[SPEAKER_01]: our efforts and created a tray,
unbeknownst to us in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: and by no means are we offended.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They created a tray for Boveda because
they said, you know, again, you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: be using tortillas to try to bring up the
relative humidity of your flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a purist.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends might call me a can of snob.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer the term purist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am very picky on what I consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know how it was produced,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care about the race to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can keep your Chernobyl and amnesia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half of those 30% THC ratings are bullshit
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact of the matter is that they
embrace the fact that tech exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last thing that someone like me
wants is cross-contamination from
[SPEAKER_01]: something that happens to be produced with
yeast, like tortillas, or something that
[SPEAKER_01]: has its own respective terpenes,
like orange rinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's very innovative and
definitely makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get into the tech side,
what some of these companies are doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: rather be green bits, you know,
or trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the POS systems are next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stuff that I wouldn't have expected
to see for another several years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the fact that, you know,
people like ArcView and BDS Analytics,
[SPEAKER_01]: Roy's company, are saying, hey,
this year in 2019, this is going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: $19 billion, billion with a B,
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only going to continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice that the right people are coming
in and taking a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you guys don't realize,
there's a lot of OGs in the room that I
[SPEAKER_01]: see right now, by the way, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of you newer to the industry,
those people are leaving some seriously
[SPEAKER_01]: great opportunities and jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all these guys get hit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I don't throw it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People know I'm an advocate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I travel, and seriously,
I'm a Gen Xer, and my friends are still
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you're in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you going to South America?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you go to Australia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you go to Europe like we do,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, because we're not the only
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: US is not the number one in many things
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis, we definitely have the culture
and the craft and the strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my gosh, the stuff that's going on
from a medical and from a scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint in a little city called Tel
Aviv, it's only 70 years old, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people don't know about, but it's in
Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know about 435 strains, or excuse me,
strains, cannabinoids associated.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are upwards of 900.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insane what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're disrupting, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hey, let's hear it for Lance,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Gaio's up front saying, we've got to
move along here five minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's perfect timing, because we have
our final speaker with a five-minute
[SPEAKER_03]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, this guy's got an incredible
history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vinu Varghese, he's an East Coast lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He started in the Brooklyn District
Attorney's Office.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's award-winning.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a nationally-known criminal defense
lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a white-collar criminal defense
lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He practices in federal courts.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also a talking head.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on Fox.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on CNN, CBS, MSNBC, HLN, where he's a
legal analyst and he gives commentary,
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to keep people out of prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not a business lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on the East Coast, where people still
go to prison for this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's got a presentation for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to just say I'm very happy to be
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run a law firm in New York on Wall
Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Criminal defense firm, but we practice all
over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I get to do,
as Debbie just mentioned, is I get to
[SPEAKER_00]: speak about a lot of different things on
television.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been on Fox talking about taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often talk about the Mueller
investigation on MSNBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Israeli TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been on CNN talking about whatever,
insider trading at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different things, Tucker
Carlson.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of different things
that I get to speak about and I enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laura Ingraham, it was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the reasons that I'm here is I
want to talk about the war on drugs that's
[SPEAKER_00]: still going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's very near and
dear to my heart because I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: prosecutor so when I started my career 20
years ago in the Brooklyn DA's office,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a soldier in the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that after time and
reflection and seeing what I saw,
[SPEAKER_00]: I left.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the big reasons I left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I write about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a post last year about Jeff
Sessions and going back to things and
[SPEAKER_00]: making him the most dangerous man in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier today they talked about the new
attorney general, soon to be attorney
[SPEAKER_00]: general William Barr and how he seems to
be a little bit better towards the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think he's a more polished version
of Jeff Sessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot of arrests all across
this country involving marijuana and it
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is that the DEA still has
marijuana schedule one drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many guys have ever seen
this but I'm sure most of you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look what it says, schedule one
drugs, substance or chemicals defined as
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs with no currently accepted medical
use, the high potential for abuse,
[SPEAKER_00]: heroin and marijuana around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Schedule two drugs, a little less severe
include cocaine, meth, methadone,
[SPEAKER_00]: hydromorphine, oxycodone, fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean this is amazing that this hasn't
changed because the law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: prosecutorial powers in this country keep
it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do that because we have a prison
industrial complex in this country which
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about, show a little clip here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is El Chapo worse than El Chupeta?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean 150 murders, a billion dollars
forfeited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you talk about credibility
which was your original question,
[SPEAKER_00]: do these guys have any credibility?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean they are clearly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are awful, awful human beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And listen, I've seen this in court myself
when you've had witnesses way worse
[SPEAKER_00]: records than my client or the other
defendants on trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a white collar case, so the guys who
committed 10 times more fraud than the
[SPEAKER_00]: guys testifying against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is why is the government
doing this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately you're gonna ask the
question when history judges us a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: decades from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Billions and billions of dollars spent on
the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this worth it if they had legalized
this, taxed this and brought this and
[SPEAKER_00]: moved to erode the violence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a prison industrial complex in
this country and that's what this war on
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs is really about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And El Chapo is just waiting for the
United States government to say hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got the big fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or everybody else will have them
cooperate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things we provided in your
bag is a little chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has where the basis, where
marijuana is from a legal perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's been legalized, decriminalized,
medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a list of all the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the bag that they came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much it for now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Question, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things are so different.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a legal market for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I was just in Boston.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't believe how alive and well
prohibition is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so frightening to see in these kind
of new and emerging markets how far behind
[SPEAKER_03]: people are.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know you're a lawyer and you're
before federal judges.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the judges thinking these days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately judges haven't really
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Judges are, these are lifetime
appointments, federal court, district
[SPEAKER_00]: court judges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these guys have been on the
bench for 20, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they believe in the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them were federal prosecutors
before they became judges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what they're used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talk about the schedule one
drugs, that's built into the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: sentencing guidelines and how many times
people are looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to take a generational
change before judges change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Generational change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've only got one minute to
accomplish that generational change.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, you guys would not believe how
intelligent and dedicated this panel is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you open up their brains like a
file cabinet, how much you can learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I encourage you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only had 45 minutes to talk about this
incredible topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't tell you everything that we
wanted to tell you during this amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So stop them in the hallway, stop them
outside, stop them on their way out the
[SPEAKER_03]: room and ask questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And get involved with their companies and
learn more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hey, I guess if you're on the East
Coast and you need a lawyer, we got the
[SPEAKER_03]: best guy that there is over there right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say thank you to everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, come by my dispensary, by the way,
really.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm leading tomorrow a tour of vape
lounges in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go to the Emerald Farms tours
booth and get your ticket.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go see what's happening in
San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys know that that onsite
consumption is not even legal in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Netherlands?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just tolerated.
[SPEAKER_03]: California is one of the few places on
earth where we have legal lounges where
[SPEAKER_03]: you can go in a dignified manner and
consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so curious to see them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked to my friend Victor at Emerald
Farms tours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, let's do a tour and go see them
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to see at least five legal
vape lounges where you can consume
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis right on the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about disruption.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be in peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to live our lives free.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make no mistake about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prohibition is going to end.
[SPEAKER_03]: The federal judges are going to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to put new people in who have
better ideas.
That is what's going to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe they'll just have to follow the
law if we get the laws changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to transition out of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be with the help of every
person in this room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for attending our panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: We look forward to talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Debbie and the entire panel, moving right
along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so very much.
