[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the first ICBC Global
Investment Forum, I think not only in
[SPEAKER_00]: Berlin, but also in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex, you invited me to this conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some good discussions in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked me for some materials,
I sent you the CV, some photos,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you continue to ask me more photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was thinking, why do you ask me for
these photos?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was too shy to ask, so I made my own
ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was because I looked too much
like a traditional banker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore I was thinking, what can I
do against that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing which came into my mind was
I let my hair grow, which I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Alex, I hope you appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to admit, this is only facade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professionally, I was grown up in banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing M&A business since almost 30
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started with Arthur Anderson in Cologne
and Milan, then build up the M&A
[SPEAKER_00]: department at Nordeby, one of Lenders
banks in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was heading the M&A department of
the Z Bank, second largest German bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worked for a family office and opened up
my own M&A boutique with partners a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, Alex, it was exactly what you
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanted the view of an M&A guy on the
cannabis industry in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we noticed one thing when we talked to
investors regarding cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always smile at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, but it's a very positive
introduction to talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't see the smile when we talk
about a machine component manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are always some engineers who you're
used to smile also when they see these
[SPEAKER_00]: machines, but usually they only smile when
they see machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But apart from that, the cannabis industry
makes people smile at the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the end, it's still a business and
the economic rationale behind it is the
[SPEAKER_00]: same as we have it in other markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my keynote, I would like to
elaborate how an M&A guy sees the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will also have a close look on the
funding landscape and the expectations of
[SPEAKER_00]: different investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will also try to highlight some
specialties and obstacles for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in Germany, always from the point
of view of an M&A guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're doing in M&A, most of the time
we organize sales processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sales does not always mean that we sell
the whole company, but we find new
[SPEAKER_00]: partners to enter the companies,
partners who bring in growth capital
[SPEAKER_00]: experience or new market opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also find adequate target companies,
adequate buyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We organize the whole transaction process
from the preparation of the information
[SPEAKER_00]: memorandum, the market approach,
organization of the due diligence process,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the negotiations until signing of the
sales and purchase agreement and finally
[SPEAKER_00]: closing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, in a nutshell, what we are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that in a corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are focusing on Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we need advice from other countries,
we are bound to an international network,
[SPEAKER_00]: GCG, Geneva Capital Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of our partner companies are like
us, owner-driven and owner-managed M&A
[SPEAKER_00]: boutiques in most of the economic centers
in the world, apart from Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suppose if we talk to our colleagues
in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: or the states, they will have a completely
different view on the cannabis market than
[SPEAKER_00]: we have it here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for our Canadian and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues, the cannabis market would be
very similar to the aforementioned machine
[SPEAKER_00]: component producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be even more interesting for
us to focus on the German market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, I think, much more fantasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last slide on what we are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our corporation is active in 27 industry
segments in 24 countries and 30% of our
[SPEAKER_00]: transactions are cross-border.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we are talking about the cannabis
segment, we are talking about the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: segment, the wellness segment,
the pharmaceutical, industrial hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use, and whatsoever, so different
markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we might also look alongside the value
chain, genetics, cultivation, processing,
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction, purification, formulation,
manufacture, distribution, retail,
[SPEAKER_00]: brand, and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what traditional investors do,
they try to find a box which they already
[SPEAKER_00]: know, and to compare this box to the
cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we start discussions with new
investors, it is very important to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the right box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we talking about agriculture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we talking about healthcare?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it narcotics?
[SPEAKER_00]: And alongside with that, we also have
different valuations wherever we take the
[SPEAKER_00]: box.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we, from Germany or Europe,
look into established markets,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's clear that we have to consider the US
and Canada and think if this could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: blueprint for the German industry or the
European cannabis market as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially in Canada, with its
relatively easy access to capital by
[SPEAKER_00]: public markets, CSE and TSX in Toronto,
opened the door to retail investors and
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we see, and we come to that a
little bit later, that with these equity
[SPEAKER_00]: stories of the stock quarter companies,
we don't have only positive effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think we can also learn something
from the experiences the Canadian and US
[SPEAKER_00]: stock quarter companies made during their
expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially the concern about the
conservative attitude of Germans towards
[SPEAKER_00]: stock markets might lead probably to other
and different forms of financing in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I haven't been there at that
time, but I think Europe must feel now a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit like the US in 2013 when
Colorado and Washington were the first to
[SPEAKER_00]: open the, were the first rec states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fundraising in the US was always
driven by new opportunities, new states,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a continuous growth since many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Canadian and US investors have a close
look on the developments in Europe and in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany and try to continue their growth
stories also in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are still in the position to do
that, I mentioned before that we come to
[SPEAKER_00]: that later, because they have to
understand and underlie their equity story
[SPEAKER_00]: and they want to replicate their success
in Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt if that would be possible as they
think, but I think that is what we can
[SPEAKER_00]: expect from the US and Canadian companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, started 2001 to enter the
medical cannabis market and we only talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about medical cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Netherlands paved the way for medical
cannabis in 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other countries followed with a very
strong delay, but production capacities
[SPEAKER_00]: are expected to build up very significant
in the years to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 European countries legalized out of 21
legalized medical cannabis in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still a very recent development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many countries enter the medical
cannabis market via projects, pilot
[SPEAKER_00]: projects, and plan to establish medical
cannabis in their healthcare systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: To date, no European country has legalized
cannabis for adult use purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luxembourg, Switzerland are thinking about
fully legalized cannabis and also
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands are rethinking the actual
concept, but today we're still talking
[SPEAKER_00]: only about medical cannabis in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: In recent times, some of the Europeans
stock exchanges woke up, especially in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United Kingdom and in Copenhagen and
Stockholm.
[SPEAKER_00]: In United Kingdom, end of 2020,
we saw an allowance that both UK and
[SPEAKER_00]: overseas cannabis companies can be listed
at the LSE, the London Stock Exchange,
[SPEAKER_00]: provided that the activities can either be
licensed or would be legal in the UK and
[SPEAKER_00]: that the proceeds of the crime act will
not apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LSE had a number of oversubscribed
IPOs and therefore the UK until now is the
[SPEAKER_00]: most active cannabis country in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: A rough estimate would be that about 50%
of the European funding volume comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: the States, comes from, sorry,
comes from the United Kingdom,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the second largest country with
approximately 10% of the funding volume is
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Germany is by far, is what we can see
here, by far the biggest medical market in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe with about 73% of the whole market
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we compare the share of the market
size which is estimated to be about 300
[SPEAKER_00]: million, I'm not talking about billion,
300 million in Europe right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and compared to the size of about 25
billion, the market size of US and Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see the big difference and where the
markets stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2017, a German pilot program for
medical cannabis allowed the production of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.6 tons for the service of selected
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are mentioned here, Aurora,
Afria, and Dimikan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these three German operators gained
substantial interest as many companies
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to get a footprint into the German
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think now we made the experience
that economic-wise, the terms of the deal
[SPEAKER_00]: were not that positive as they expected to
be at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Germany cannot meet the total demand of
about 5.5 tons per annum and imports the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest from usually Canada and Netherlands
in the history, but nowadays also from
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain, Denmark, Portugal, and some other
countries which cover the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the big three or four
countries, companies which are used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: said that they dominate the market,
they all come from the states in North
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a lot of value chains enhancement
in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their acquisition strategy follows a
horizontal integration alongside the value
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw a lot of transactions in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came to the German, come to the German
transaction in a while, and we will see
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are not that active anymore,
at least in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a very notable transaction in
the states that the Tilray acquired a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant stake in the multi-state
operator Madman with 26 dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_00]: also a private equity company from Toronto
entered in and put in another $100 million
[SPEAKER_00]: in proceeds to open new markets and
another 15 dispensaries are secured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a movement between the states
and Canada, and when we look at some,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's anything we can learn from the
development of these big cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, I always used to look at the
figures, and when we look at the figures
[SPEAKER_00]: of, for example, Aurora and also Canopy
Growth, the revenue, and I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020, the revenue of Aurora was roughly
300 million, and the net loss was 3.3
[SPEAKER_00]: billion, and this is not an error.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the balance sheet of Aurora of
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they made a lot of impairments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was roughly 2.5 billion of negative
impairments, and even if we take out the
[SPEAKER_00]: negative impairments of 2.5 billion,
there's still a significant net loss in
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison to the revenue made,
and if we also look at Canopy Growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is similar, it's revenue of roughly
400 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have impairments of about 600
millions and a net loss of 1.3 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a traditional investor looks at
these figures, must say something went
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not profitable on an operative
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made much too expensive acquisitions
in the past, and I leave it to your
[SPEAKER_00]: judgment if the way Canadian and U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis company grew in the past,
is that what we should adopt in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at the European landscape,
and when we remember the market size,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can also think that the investor
landscape is very different from the
[SPEAKER_00]: states, and the investor types which drive
the development in Europe right now are
[SPEAKER_00]: almost, for about 80%, early-stage
investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means accelerators, incubators,
high-networked individuals, which stand
[SPEAKER_00]: for about roughly 45% of the funding
volume in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And venture capital in its different
stages stands for another roughly 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only more or less 10% of the
transaction of the funding volume came
[SPEAKER_00]: from, let's say, traditional investors,
private equity, and family offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives, in my opinion,
a clear difference between where the
[SPEAKER_00]: American, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and American and the Canadian market and
the European market stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, talking about Germany,
there are a lot of transactions which took
[SPEAKER_00]: place especially in this year,
and we saw an increasing M&A activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we saw a bunch of very different
transactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recent transaction from all this year
is Australian Health House bought Cann
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharma, a privately held German medical
cannabis sales and distribution company
[SPEAKER_00]: which owns also a clinic, medical cannabis
consultancy in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Germany, Cann Pharma imports and
distributes third-party medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products and holds also a pharmaceutical
manufacturing license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Health House could leverage the
German contacts of Cann Pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second transaction which took place in
June this year, and from my opinion is the
[SPEAKER_00]: most interesting transaction, is Sanity
Group, a startup from Berlin, founded in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018, was able to close the biggest
funding of roughly 36 million from new and
[SPEAKER_00]: existing investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the second financing round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And investors from Europe, but also from
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, and I'm very curious,
if we can hear more about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: from my point of view, very exciting
transaction, a while, from the founder,
[SPEAKER_00]: Finn Hensel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canovo, also a German company founded in
2019, is the only stock listed company,
[SPEAKER_00]: was stock listed in May.
[SPEAKER_00]: May 2021, it's not stock listed in
Toronto, it's not the Nasdaq, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: London, it's not Frankfurt, it's
Düsseldorf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the first listing we saw in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Canovo is also a fully licensed
pharmaceutical wholesaler, an importer of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis products, also based in
Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also want to launch a proprietary
medical brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the transactions continue with
Demekan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also this different kind of
transaction, also very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Demekan wants to cover the entire
production chain for medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: from cultivation to further processing and
storage to distribution to the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company, still very young,
was founded in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in May 2019, he was, Demekan was
awarded one of the three contracts by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal Institutes for Drugs and Medical
Devices, Befarm in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the only independent German
company to cultivate and to distribute
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last but not least, we also saw a merger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cana Medical and PS Troupe joined their
forces to form Semdor Pharma Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: PS Group founded in 93, is a
pharmaceutical manufacturer, re-importer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and logistics service provider for the
narcotics industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cana Medical, prior to the merger,
was an independent wholesaler of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we also saw a private equity
company, Orchila Capital, who stepped into
[SPEAKER_00]: the merger with about 40 million of new
capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the transaction landscape we
saw this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also mentioned one, two tombstones more
from recent years, from prior years,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019, which I don't want to elaborate on
that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that means we see much more M&A
activities in the past in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what gives me even more confidence for
the German cannabis market, these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: transactions, these are the companies who
got funding in Germany, but there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of companies which is active
in the German cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are also present in this
conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, for example, I'm very
curious to hear the experience of Tim
[SPEAKER_00]: Feike, the CEO of Wiko.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will talk to us later today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting company.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about early stages of
investors, and I mentioned this is more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less the investor type we're talking about
in the German cannabis markets,
[SPEAKER_00]: early stage investors are strong
believers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And traditional investors ask for
evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the difference between
these investor types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually, evidence should be
demonstrated in financial statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditional investors love long,
established, strong-going markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And profitable and cashflow positive
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So none of the Canadian stock listed
companies would match the expectations of
[SPEAKER_00]: German traditional investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Canadian companies and the market
they are active in serve as a blueprint
[SPEAKER_00]: for the German cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give clear evidence to the fact that
the cannabis market is existing and is
[SPEAKER_00]: strong growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initial product, the cannabis flower,
already exists and we don't have to invent
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have the proof that it can be
sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, the proof of concept is already
there, even in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the difference from a market
in which a startup wants to sell a new and
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution in a machine which nobody knows
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: The founder believes that his machine will
be disruptive and he needs other believers
[SPEAKER_00]: and we see investors to give him money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is an already existing product
and is already sold internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once national legislations change,
the cannabis market from our point of view
[SPEAKER_00]: will develop very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we believe that the step
from an early stage investor, which we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: before, to traditional investors will be a
very short one and will be very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my assumption that traditional
investors will look at opportunities which
[SPEAKER_00]: offer at least one profitable year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the funds usually require at least
three profitable years, but I think in
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry for not all funds,
but some funds might also accept one
[SPEAKER_00]: positive year and companies should have a
turnover of around 10 million or slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: below that, then they will gain the
attention of traditional investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that this sales level
should be achievable, especially for
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution and sales company in a
relatively short timeframe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a lot of money in the market
and not enough attractive target companies
[SPEAKER_00]: to satisfy the appetite of the
institutional investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: German traditional investors usually are
interested in cannabis business models
[SPEAKER_00]: once we talk to them, but there's still
very little know-how and understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm also very grateful for
Alex's work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more know-how and understanding of
the cannabis market in Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the traditional investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this applies for different kind of
investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: For almost every established market,
we have investors who have a specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: sector expertise or they have experience
from recent or formal participations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cannabis market, apart from general
curiousness and a positive attitude,
[SPEAKER_00]: we still notice a lack of a solid gut
feeling which makes traditional investors
[SPEAKER_00]: jump into a participation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still ongoing discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking about narcotics or an
agricultural product, some investors still
[SPEAKER_00]: have compliance problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: German banks are still very restrictive as
far as real estate financing is concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the cannabis production sites are
built outside Germany and German banks
[SPEAKER_00]: usually do not want to finance
cross-border.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of them still have compliance
problems and still exclude cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: For real estate investors, cannabis farms
are a niche market with high capital
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements for relatively small
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis production sites are also
seen as special purpose properties with an
[SPEAKER_00]: unclear second use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And third, most of the real estate
investors are too small in order to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: positive impact of a cannabis production
site on their risk position and the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall real estate portfolio.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are only two handful of potential
investors in Germany right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Political risk and dependency,
mainly on political decision, is also
[SPEAKER_00]: something which traditional investors do
not like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are some obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we work today on the first one,
the understanding and know-how of the
[SPEAKER_00]: German cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I stick to my belief, which I
mentioned before, the step from an early
[SPEAKER_00]: stage market to traditional investors in
the cannabis industry will be a very fast
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you all inspiring hours on the
first ICBC Global Investment Forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good discussions, exciting contacts,
and a growth in networks and ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to Alex and his team that you
had the courage to bring this format to
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany also at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much and thank you very
much for your attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
