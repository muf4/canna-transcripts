[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're ready to begin now,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, when Alex told me about this first
speaker, we were all very excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: For real.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not every day that you get the
Secretary for Health for the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: country of Slovenia to come up and give
some welcoming remarks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is an honor and a pleasure and a
delight and a special thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so please put your hands together and
welcome Dr. Metka Poragi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Alex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Tol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dear participants of the International
Cannabis Business Conference, esteemed
[SPEAKER_00]: organizers, we are pleased and honored to
host such an important conference on the
[SPEAKER_00]: topic of cannabis here in our beautiful
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is why I want to present an
especially warm welcome from the Cabinet
[SPEAKER_00]: of Prime Minister of the Republic of
Slovenia, Dr. Robert Gulub.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can confidently say that this
conference is being held at the best
[SPEAKER_00]: possible time.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to our data, around 40% of
Slovenians have had experiences with
[SPEAKER_00]: products derived from the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, we have reflected this fact
in our coalition agreement and decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: include the implementation of use of
cannabis in medicine in our program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our wish is to demolish the black market
with the introduction of new legal
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, which would subsequently
create a legal way for Slovene patients
[SPEAKER_00]: and other users to purchase and consume
cannabis products that will be safe and
[SPEAKER_00]: irreproachable from the medical
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, the production of such
products will be regulated and controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: under watchful eye of the Slovenian
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had several important Slovenian
associations advocate for this change in
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, Association of Oncology
Patients of Slovenia, the Association
[SPEAKER_00]: Europa Donna, several Slovenian
pediatricians, and of course, several
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and users who have identified
that the overwhelming health benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis outweigh archaic criminal
viewpoint on this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This old perspective needs to be changed,
especially due to scientific evidence that
[SPEAKER_00]: the health benefits of using of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wish that we would hear less and less
medieval accusations about the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products, and we hope that common
sense will prevail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm personally most interested about the
scientific research on the topic of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and will be listening with
interest to all those panelists speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You truly have gathered the best experts
to shed light on this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you a successful and
knowledge-filled conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40% of Slovenians have tried cannabis,
so I feel like I know most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just, I've been here two days.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
