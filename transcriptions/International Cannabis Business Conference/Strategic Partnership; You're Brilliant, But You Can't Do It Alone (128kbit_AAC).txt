[SPEAKER_01]: Next up, strategic partnerships.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what product you have,
whatever service you provide, the right
[SPEAKER_01]: partner can make all the difference,
whether it is in-house or somebody you
[SPEAKER_01]: work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to introduce the moderator of the
strategic partnership panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is really a pioneer in southern
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's the CEO of Sun Breeze Inc.,
a family-owned seed-to-sale cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please give a warm welcome to our
moderator, Ms. Bree Malarkey.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on up, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of us need any strategic
partnerships, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows everything, and they've
got everything perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to take a minute to
introduce our panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some great people here from
Oregon and beyond.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to tell you really quickly about
myself, and then we'll kind of pass it on,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an herbalist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been studying plant medicine for over
15 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Beyond Herbs and Plants really wanted
to embrace the ultimate mother plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, and opened a medical dispensary
in 2014, a product line, and an herb farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's go on and introduce the rest of
our panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please say your name and just a quick
history about who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Pete Tram, and I'm from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a co-partner in RootsRx and
co-partner and founder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have six stores, recreational stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three grows, one outdoor,
two indoor, and a small medical store.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Tim Winter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the president of Shadowbox Farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a 35-acre farm in Williams and a
corporate office here in Portland,
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon, where we run all the
administration of the company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Jordan Wellington.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the chief compliance officer at
Simplifya.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a regulatory compliance software
that helps cannabis businesses really
[SPEAKER_05]: follow the regulations and kind of stay in
operational compliance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my night job is I do public
policy and government affairs in the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis regulatory market.
[SPEAKER_05]: I implemented legalization on behalf of
the state of Colorado and now do public
[SPEAKER_05]: policy with NCIA and really cannabis
businesses all over the country on
[SPEAKER_05]: regulatory matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was kind of joking.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all can't be all three.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all have to do all things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we work hard to form our
organizations, we have to look and
[SPEAKER_03]: identify what are our individual strengths
and what are our weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a hard thing for a lot of
people to address.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thought we would start by talking
about how each of our organizations were
[SPEAKER_03]: formed and where we looked for strategic
partnerships in our formations.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, I'm an herbalist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a visionary philosopher.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm customer service.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the team development kind of vision
person.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a really big weakness for me was the
business office, the financials,
[SPEAKER_03]: the accounting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lucky me, my business partner and
husband is an ex-CFO and controller in the
[SPEAKER_03]: utility industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we formed our herbal products
company, it was a real great partnership.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really balanced kind of the front of
the house and the back of the house and
[SPEAKER_03]: have a great balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wanted to open it up to the panel in
forming your organizations.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were some of the strategic
partnerships that you guys all looked for
[SPEAKER_03]: in how you formed your organizations?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived just down the street from Aspen,
Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, I had a small medical
concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2014, when we started our
recreational business, basically went
[SPEAKER_00]: beating the streets and came up with my
now partner, I should say, my very just
[SPEAKER_00]: recently ex-partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came from Wall Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a hedge fund background and really
brought a different or a really unique
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective on how to run a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was very complimentary to what I did,
which was grow cannabis and sell cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to have somebody with a real solid
financial background really made our
[SPEAKER_00]: company dynamic and really let us move
forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm kind of the cannabis virgin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been in the industry for 10 months.
[SPEAKER_06]: My background was I ran a tech company
here in Portland.
[SPEAKER_06]: Prior to that, I ran School of Rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: And most notably, I helped Mark Wattles
build Hollywood Entertainment.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got into cannabis because I really hated
the hypocrisy of what was happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought I could make a difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our company was well on its way.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were about two years into it when I
joined.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although we were a case of maybe too much
money and not enough thought.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we really over the last year have
been in a process of rebuilding our
[SPEAKER_06]: company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the strategic partnerships were
critical to what we did in this last 11
[SPEAKER_06]: months.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of our agreements, most of the things
we did were very old school.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were on the back of a napkin with a
yellow crayon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had to put solid structure in place
in order to grow where we wanted to do and
[SPEAKER_06]: have the foundation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were operating without a mission.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had no values.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have a vision statement.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had no brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so establishing all of those things
over the last month.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our investors like to say that we
remodeled the houses.
[SPEAKER_06]: We chose to live in the house as we
remodeled it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But those strategic partnerships are the
only way that we were able to survive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's with our attorneys.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's with our PR firm.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's with our vendors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody through there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's creating those relationships and
those partnerships with those people,
[SPEAKER_06]: which was so critical to our success
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess in founding Simplify,
the compliance software company that I
[SPEAKER_05]: work for now, I was literally nothing just
a policy nerd that had done a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: government affairs and kind of advising
cannabis businesses on operational
[SPEAKER_05]: compliance and had this vision and idea
for a software.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had no idea how to create a
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or found a company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or raise money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or build any kind of tech platform.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things I like to say is we're
Simplify.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the first things I learned
about a tech company is you're supposed to
[SPEAKER_05]: make up a word, but it has to sound like
another word when you're starting a tech
[SPEAKER_05]: company.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I literally knew nothing about
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had this vision and understood
cannabis regulation at a very fundamental
[SPEAKER_05]: level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was very fortunate that Christian
Sederberg, the partner of the law firm I
[SPEAKER_05]: still work with, had a friend who's now
our CEO Marion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we sat in a conference room one day
very casually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was like, you can trust this guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's retired.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's sold five companies already.
[SPEAKER_05]: All tech platforms for the most part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Explained to him your idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our company was born that day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, I'm coming out of
retirement to run this company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the first strategic partner that I
think I found and a lot of people have
[SPEAKER_05]: said is the kind of yin to your yang,
the balance to your equation where I know
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't do everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of things in our company I
can't do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And finding those people that are really
able to kind of complement your skill set
[SPEAKER_05]: and balance out, even at the very initial
phase, before you even start figuring out
[SPEAKER_05]: who your lawyer and who your accountant's
going to be, you need to think about your
[SPEAKER_05]: executive team, your top people,
and who's going to balance out the skills
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you bring on additional strategic
partners to kind of complement those
[SPEAKER_05]: folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I think that's a great point,
especially for a lot of us that are
[SPEAKER_03]: founders and have a vision is recognizing
who can complement that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes that means that even though
you are the founder, you're not meant to
[SPEAKER_03]: be the CEO, to run the organization,
to have it become a healthy entity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember once somebody saying,
just because you're a really good plumber
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't mean you know how to run a
plumbing business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just because you're a great cultivator
doesn't mean you're going to know how to
[SPEAKER_03]: run a cultivating business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go to what you love, because you're
going to be doing it 90 hours a week,
[SPEAKER_03]: give or take.
[SPEAKER_03]: So put your heart and soul where your
passion is and then surround yourself with
[SPEAKER_03]: really powerful people that can help you
get that vision out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so sometimes that's hiring the right
people to join your team.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes it's going outside of your
organization and really looking for a
[SPEAKER_03]: partner, maybe an independent contractor,
a key, you guys already hit on all this,
[SPEAKER_03]: attorneys, software companies,
especially in the land of compliance,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're really relying on a lot of third
parties to really make sure our businesses
[SPEAKER_03]: are successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, when we really wanted to
launch SunGod Medicinals finally up into
[SPEAKER_03]: the Portland market, I really needed a
delivery and logistics company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really believe in account management,
you know, as an herbal products company,
[SPEAKER_03]: extracting 50 different herbs and plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of education that we need to
provide our bud tenders and people out
[SPEAKER_03]: there in the market, but I needed a
logistics company to actually deliver
[SPEAKER_03]: those products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we chose to partner with Dreamfield up
here in Portland because they could help
[SPEAKER_03]: me get that product out there but still
keep my account manager vision going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you guys give everybody in the
audience maybe a little example of a
[SPEAKER_03]: strategic partner that you've chosen that
was outside of your area of expertise and
[SPEAKER_03]: how you made that decision?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was, again, real fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had in Colorado several different legal
firms that we could have gone to for legal
[SPEAKER_00]: advice and had talked to several people
about the best people to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up with a firm that has done
amazing things for our company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't say enough about having good
legal representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting into this business,
it will be one of the cornerstones of your
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to have people that you trust
and people that you can depend on and
[SPEAKER_00]: people you can call on a Sunday afternoon
and go, how am I going to deal with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say for me, that was one of the
most important strategic partnerships we
[SPEAKER_00]: were able to form.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh, there are so many.
[SPEAKER_06]: In tech, your circle is very wide.
[SPEAKER_06]: In what I found in cannabis, it got
narrower and narrower.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was a lot of distrust.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we were trying to build
partnerships, it was like, well,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to need to be paid in advance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I'm going to need this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't realize how many people had
gotten burned.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I saw that as an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say probably the biggest strategic
partner we have is with FFE Extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're really good at growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have great genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can produce a lot of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all wonderful.
[SPEAKER_06]: But being able to turn it into other
products.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think building that partnership
with an extract company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they wanted to date for a long time
before they would do business with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the commitments that I've made
with all of our vendors is we pay our
[SPEAKER_06]: bills.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't overextend ourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we pay our bills when we say we're
going to pay our bills.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I go through with my director of
finance every week.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we go through AP.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we pay our bills.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think they were pretty surprised by
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's really important when
you're developing and building strategic
[SPEAKER_06]: partnerships.
[SPEAKER_06]: That you don't burn people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that you keep those tight.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you build those relationships.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because they will pay huge dividends down
the road.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I get to come at this panel from
kind of two different directions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because sometimes I'm the strategic
partner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes I'm looking for a strategic
partner.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess just to be different,
I'll take the other angle.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I'm acting as a consultant,
when I'm providing policy guidance or
[SPEAKER_05]: government affairs work, from the
consultant's perspective, I think it's
[SPEAKER_05]: important to understand that it's really a
relationship that needs to be bilateral.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a relationship that needs to function
bilaterally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just in an economic sense,
but in an interpersonal sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my high level thought here is that
what you really need to be doing is find
[SPEAKER_05]: the consultant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Find that strategic partner that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: That fits in with the ethos of your
organization.
[SPEAKER_05]: With your personality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And understands where you're going.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a ton of consultants in this
space.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the ongoing jokes in this
industry is how quickly the consultants
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of seem to multiply and grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the unbelievable number of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of them are great people.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have to find the one that fits you
and understands your brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And understands your value.
[SPEAKER_05]: And fits in with the way you want to run
your business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that kind of relationship,
a lot of the guidance I need to give to
[SPEAKER_05]: clients when I'm in that role and in that
world, is not what I would do in that
[SPEAKER_05]: situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's helping them make the decision for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not what Jordan thinks is the best thing
for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what they would think the best thing
would be for them if they had all the
[SPEAKER_05]: information that I have.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying to provide them with
information.
[SPEAKER_05]: Provide them with pertinent information.
[SPEAKER_05]: But provide it in a way that is useful for
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And useful for their decision making.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which means we have to get along.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to know each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to share similar values to some
extent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that the advice you're getting isn't
coming out of left field.
[SPEAKER_05]: But really coming from a place that
holistically works with the way that you
[SPEAKER_05]: view your business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what you're trying to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next thing I really wanted to bring
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of us definitely understand this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is government and regulatory partnerships.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of you in the room are probably
thinking what is this lady talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: They are evil.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are forcing us to be in a certain
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way I look at it is we are all the
government.
[SPEAKER_03]: We live in a republic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we vote for representatives to
represent our interests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have opportunities to be involved
in either legislation and the laws that
[SPEAKER_03]: are in our local jurisdictions or our
state level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not so much at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we still vote for representatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what can we do when then different
agencies are tasked with implementing
[SPEAKER_03]: those laws?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the opportunities to influence the
rules and regulations to implement those
[SPEAKER_03]: laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm talking beyond OLCC.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe ODA with hemp regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or licensing our scales.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or licensing our food establishments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or OSHA who's ensuring that we have good
worker safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And many of these different agencies out
there really want collaboration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really want to be a part of a public
private partnership.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they do nothing for any of us if
there is discourse.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are the ones trying to make sure that
human health and wellness is protected.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the goals and the vision for us as a
collective group are manifested here in
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example recently we partnered with
OSHA and took advantage of their
[SPEAKER_03]: consultation program and invited OSHA into
our facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually have a program that if
you invite their OSHA consultants in you
[SPEAKER_03]: are immune from any fines for a certain
amount of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they tell you all the different things
you could be doing to better protect the
[SPEAKER_03]: health and wellness of your associates and
your employees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to let you know if you're breaking any
laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I really think was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as all of us him and ha about OLCC
and the rules changing all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to encourage everybody to
really involve themselves with different
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory agencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe you guys can all give an example
of how you've really worked with
[SPEAKER_03]: government affairs or within your own
organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as probably a lot of you folks have
done too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually the first recreational
store in several municipalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll give you an example of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was our first recreational store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in locally to the local government
or the county government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like hey I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get local licensing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people weren't so happy and warm and
fuzzy about me being a cannabis guy and
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in and trying to get local
licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the paperwork and left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like geez you know that was a
pretty cold reception I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next time I went in I went to a
local restaurant that makes great homemade
[SPEAKER_00]: pies and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought a pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sliced it up and I said to the
reception ladies it was the planning
[SPEAKER_00]: department where the cannabis czar is
basically of this county.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sliced up the pie and gave some to the
receptionist and gave some to the guy that
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to be the cannabis czar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't quite named yet but we knew we
identified who he was and that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the cannabis czar for the
county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sat down and we ate pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it sounds simple and almost
contrite but it was such an ice breaker
[SPEAKER_00]: and to break bread with folks and to sit
down and to be on a personal level with
[SPEAKER_00]: them really made all the difference in the
world starting that relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from then on I was the pie guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody expected either donuts or
pie or something every time I walked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked like a charm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would tell you that the takeaway from
that is that these are all people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in a lot of cases great
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're public servants for God's sake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So treat them with respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them with dignity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them as you would a neighbor or a
friend and you'll be surprised how well
[SPEAKER_00]: those relationships go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love what you said in the sense that
we have to have these folks as partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more they're in our facilities the
more transparent we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The better we're going to get along with
these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just don't be adversarial with these
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will serve you in no way shape or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them your partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat them again with respect and dignity
and it will go a long way for you.
That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Common human kindness.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always remember your please and thank
yous.
[SPEAKER_06]: We learn it as kids and then we forget it
at about age 20 and then live a miserable
[SPEAKER_06]: life.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that Josephine County we've really
reached out to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do the litter cleanup along the roads
and do all the maintenance along Cedar
[SPEAKER_06]: Flat Road.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we work with them and when we walk
into that into their offices we're always
[SPEAKER_06]: welcomed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're not that big wreck up there on
the hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we've really worked with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the OLCC you all get the OLCC
memo.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were hit with a pretty big fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: We used to operate under the guise of beg
for forgiveness and we don't do that
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what they were great through
the whole process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it embarrassing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It certainly doesn't fit our values of
operational excellence.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we were never treated rudely and I
think that was our relationship.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the very first things I did when I
started running the company was hired we
[SPEAKER_06]: have a compliance officer who his number
one job was to be embedded in the OLCC and
[SPEAKER_06]: know everybody and be able to know the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I had a question I wanted to ask it
and know it right there and not have to
[SPEAKER_06]: have somebody go research it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think having that relationship with
the OLCC really attributed to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think exactly what you guys all said.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not your adversary.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're actually your partner.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll get to success a whole lot
faster with pie than you will with
[SPEAKER_06]: fighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in all of the experiences I've had
around that that's definitely consistent
[SPEAKER_05]: with what I've seen from a regulatory
perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Building relationships with regulators is
kind of critical.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's important to understand that this
isn't just a local game.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works its way all the way up through
the state and even to the federal
[SPEAKER_05]: government.
[SPEAKER_05]: I look at cannabis legalization and the
end of prohibition a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: differently than a lot of folks given the
nature of my initial engagement with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just some policy nerd from New
Jersey that moved to Colorado and the
[SPEAKER_05]: state was like you go figure this out and
implement legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had my little brothers back home
being like you better not screw this up
[SPEAKER_05]: for the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my prism, my first really emotional
reaction to all of this is not that it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: right actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: But today it's not even a privilege.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a responsibility.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a responsibility that we have to
everybody else that's not living in a free
[SPEAKER_05]: society.
[SPEAKER_05]: At least as it comes to cannabis
prohibition and doing things the right
[SPEAKER_05]: way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that involves really changing kind of
hearts and minds and stealing almost like
[SPEAKER_05]: a military term.
[SPEAKER_05]: And understanding that what we're trying
to do here is kind of convince the people
[SPEAKER_05]: from outside the cannabis community that
cannabis legalization is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That prohibition was not the appropriate
way to structure and regulate society and
[SPEAKER_05]: control society.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that cannabis businesses can follow
regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can lobby and change laws at
Congress.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's following the regulations and
building local regulations so you can get
[SPEAKER_05]: answers from OLCC and things like that are
incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now the narrative is that cannabis
regulation works.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that narrative shifts and businesses
stop complying with the regulations,
[SPEAKER_05]: if licenses start getting pulled left and
right and violations go up, we're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: see the tide turn.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to see the people who are not
part of the cannabis community being like
[SPEAKER_05]: well those people couldn't be trusted.
[SPEAKER_05]: We gave them a chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you see that same thing going all the
way up through the federal government.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you go, I don't know how many
people have been to NCIA's lobby days,
[SPEAKER_05]: but to actually go down to Congress and
actually meet with people and show them
[SPEAKER_05]: the face of the people running the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot easier to be like all those
cannabis people are criminals when they're
[SPEAKER_05]: just some kind of faceless person.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have a name.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not human.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're dehumanized in their mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you go there and sit down across
from them and really meet with them,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a lot harder for them to think bad
things about you because they've met you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You talk about your kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: You talk about your family.
[SPEAKER_05]: You talk about how you're just like them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're a good person trying to do the
right by the people in your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you have to build those
relationships at the local level through
[SPEAKER_05]: PIE.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to build relationships with
compliance officers at the state level
[SPEAKER_05]: with the OLCC to get answers to your
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to actually engage at the
federal level to help everybody move this
[SPEAKER_05]: forward and understand that this is
beyond, it's even beyond a business
[SPEAKER_05]: necessity.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a necessity for our movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a necessity to end prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a necessity for our entire industry
to survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think all of us in the room have
kind of had that feeling of being the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning of legalization here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't mess it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, our dispensary in southern
Oregon and Little Gold Hill was the very
[SPEAKER_03]: first one to get a moratorium lifted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to work really, really hard with
the city government.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every single one of them that voted
for our license then faced a recall
[SPEAKER_03]: election in the community for allowing us
to open.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they all held their position.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, no, I got to do this
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then Medford's not going to open
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Grants Pass isn't going to open up if
I make a mistake here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having that ownership and that feeling
of that, hey, we can open this up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we've done a great job here in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to think that our great
testing model and our organizational
[SPEAKER_03]: structure between us and the regulatory
agency are models that other states are
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially using in benchmarking with
OLCC and all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that you're doing a lot of
consulting work and some of the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that's happening in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now that we have our organizations
formed, we have great partnerships.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have great consultants and
wonderful employees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are working really well with our
government agencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another big strategic partnership that I
really think about is branding and
[SPEAKER_03]: promotions and how to get your brand out
there, which is really important,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially, I call it the Goldilocks
Principle here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to produce just the right amount
for our citizens, or prices plummet,
[SPEAKER_03]: or there's risk of people exporting
without permission.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what can we do to really promote our
brands within our communities?
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, that was public relations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I looked at a few different PR firms.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just personally felt that
outsourcing that, I really couldn't really
[SPEAKER_03]: keep that vision consistent with our
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually decided to just recently
hire a brand manager in-house.
[SPEAKER_03]: But can you guys share with us a little
bit about what you've done for branding
[SPEAKER_03]: and marketing and strategic partnerships
and really getting your message out there
[SPEAKER_03]: in the community?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, we were very fortunate because
we had the resources to do in-house
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we were vertically integrated,
it made it very easy for us to tell a
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, I think
marketing boils down to a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can create whatever story you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was telling the panel earlier,
our story is and was that we have a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in Leadville, Colorado, which is the
highest municipality in the lower 48.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in effect, we have the highest legal
grow in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a budtender says that to a guest,
it rolls right after that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, what do you mean
the highest grow in the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there becomes this conversation
about this grow in Leadville, Colorado at
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,200 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that starts to brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing that and by doing it on a
literally guest-to-guest level,
[SPEAKER_00]: the word gets out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you guys know, the best way to
brand yourself is by someone else branding
[SPEAKER_00]: you and by someone that has tried your
product on, those guys are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The budtenders are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The facility is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel safe, warm, and fuzzy when I'm in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walk out with some of the best
product I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that in my mind is, is it strategic
branding?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't call it strategic branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd call it grassroots branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for us, it bode very well for
our business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we were able to open six stores
and be very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be my takeaway in branding.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think your customers are strategic
partnerships, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're doing it right and you're really
able to get your mission through and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're very passionate about what you're
doing, they're going to go out there and
[SPEAKER_03]: share with other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So part of your strategy is being very
true to the vision and mission with every
[SPEAKER_03]: touch point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's so important,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can spend so much money on
outside marketing and outside marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we all know, there's 50,000 people that
want to be your marketing representative
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, it's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what you have in that jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's what you're able to purvey and
educate your guests to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're able to do that responsibly
and in a kind manner, it goes a really
[SPEAKER_00]: long way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the foundation is the values of
your company and your mission.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today when Mr. Belushi was talking about
being stewards of the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's Shadowbox's mission.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are stewards of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I first started with the company,
we were trying to roll out a new product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we, I don't know, we talked for two
months.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they couldn't agree on what the
packaging was going to look like or this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was very obvious that we couldn't
make those decisions because we didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: know what we were.
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't know what we stood for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we even went out and hired a marketing
firm.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they didn't know what we were.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they didn't know what we stood for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've heard it a hundred times in
different meetings that, oh, we don't have
[SPEAKER_06]: enough time for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have time for that BS.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't afford that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can't afford not to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to slow down.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to decide, what are you about?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you stand for?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you stand for something or you
stand for nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is your company going to
represent?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you going to represent?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that your employees too, what do they,
why do they work for you?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all of these pieces connect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can talk about a strategic
partner.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you go out and hire a marketing
firm, you think they're going to fix it
[SPEAKER_06]: before you've done that homework,
before you've built that foundation?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to spend a whole lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're going to spin around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the end of it, you're not going to
know what you stand for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think there is a step before you
go strategic partner in the marketing
[SPEAKER_06]: realm.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's agencies out there who can
help you do this work if you don't know
[SPEAKER_06]: how to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a good investment.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the good fortune of doing it a few
times in my life.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we saved that money.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we took the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it took us about three months.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did the homework.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we brought the team in.
[SPEAKER_06]: What did we want to represent?
[SPEAKER_06]: What were our values?
[SPEAKER_06]: What was our stake in the ground,
our true north that we wouldn't deviate
[SPEAKER_06]: from?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was fascinating about it is it
began to resonate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the employees started to regurgitate
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they started to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had this really pivotal moment in
our history of our companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had two extractor machines that we
prematurely bought.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a horrible break-in.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them got stolen.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had one left with some various parts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had an opportunity to sell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the person we were going to sell it to
wanted it to be a cash deal and wouldn't
[SPEAKER_06]: fill out the RS paperwork.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the time, we really needed the
money.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about $125,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really needed the money.
[SPEAKER_06]: And out of the mouth of babes,
our office manager said, it just doesn't
[SPEAKER_06]: feel right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not part of our values.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think if we do this, Tim, we're not
being good stewards.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it stopped me in my tracks because I
was focused on the 125 grand and how I was
[SPEAKER_06]: going to figure out how to deposit
$100,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't thinking about and out of the
mouth of babes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's when you know you got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we engaged a PR firm because we
were able to show them our brand book.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were able to show them what we stand
for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when that begins to resonate through
your whole organization, we were able to
[SPEAKER_06]: launch five new SKUs from January till
June.
[SPEAKER_06]: We couldn't get one done.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we were able to do five because it's
very easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know what we stand for.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know what our brand is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can get into a room and we can do
it pretty quickly now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say that's the foundation.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think you don't have time,
you better make time, especially before
[SPEAKER_06]: you engage a PR firm or a marketing firm
that will take a whole lot of money from
[SPEAKER_06]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been really a new problem that
I've had to face in my career is how do
[SPEAKER_05]: you brand yourself?
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the cannabis industry, I think
whether you're selling B2C or B2B,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think as Peter noted, it's really a
grassroots effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've taken a lot of different approaches
as a cannabis compliance software company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody just thinks we're an inventory
tracking company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody that ever hears us is like,
oh, you're just like MJ Freeway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're just like Green Bits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you're just like Flow Hub,
depending on which is the talk of the town
[SPEAKER_05]: at the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're not anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And explaining what we do is complicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what our value is is kind of tricky
because people don't like compliance.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't like to follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't get into cannabis because they
liked following rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: My opinion is everybody in the cannabis
industry is anti-authoritarian.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want everybody to follow this one
set of rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ignore all the other ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the cannabis regulatory rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen to those so we can legalize
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the OSHA part, worker safety?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Business regulation stuff, just not
government stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is from the government affairs
guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ignore the drug laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe listen to some other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Jordan, do you mind if we open it up
for questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we only have eight minutes left.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to give people a chance to cut
you off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for the panel one more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very informative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone have a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys seem to be soaking it all up like
a sponge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wandering around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stood up for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: You must have been very thorough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I know that there's a lot of
different kinds of partnerships in
[SPEAKER_03]: business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we only covered a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is anybody dealing with any?
[SPEAKER_03]: Partnership issues or wondering if you
should do something?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do if it doesn't work out?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you set up a partnership.
[SPEAKER_02]: You sign the things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do your due diligence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still not great.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you extract yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they're an employee, you terminate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's an independent contractor,
make sure you have a good contract and
[SPEAKER_03]: indemnification clauses to try to help you
with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's a regulatory agency,
then you're backpacking Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what if it doesn't work out with any
of your strategic partners?
[SPEAKER_00]: So inner circle folks, that core of people
that run your business, it's a marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, it's a marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in your case, it is a marriage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what it has to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be very selective about that marriage,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't date someone for two days and
go, hey, let's get married.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You date someone for six months,
a year, a year and a half, two years
[SPEAKER_00]: before you go, hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get married.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be just unbelievably selective about
that inner circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would much rather have a piece of
the chain or a piece of the pie missing
[SPEAKER_00]: and not be able to function in that area
than have a real adversarial situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially within that inner circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be advised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to like the people you're
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a saying in our business,
no assholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, too, a lot of people really rush
business formation, just really taking the
[SPEAKER_03]: time to have a good operating agreement,
good communication of goals, involve a
[SPEAKER_03]: really good law firm, unless you have
those skills yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the more you lay a great
foundation, then you can really move
[SPEAKER_03]: forward from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they'll always go bad at some
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some relationship will always go bad in
business.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a rule.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's act in the highest sense of
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And always be respectful.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you do get to that point,
there's a way to be respectful.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as far as employees go, we hire adults
and treat them like adults.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also expect them to act like
adults.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you do get to that point where
sometimes you have to say, you have to
[SPEAKER_06]: break up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think having a high emotional
intelligence, being able to be respectful
[SPEAKER_06]: and try to understand the other person's
point of view.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you act in the highest sense of
right, you can usually get through those.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think it's so important to
understand that you never want to be a
[SPEAKER_05]: bridge burner, especially in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so small.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so familial.
[SPEAKER_05]: People know each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people, these relationships,
I mean, they go back a very long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even new ones seem to be deeper than
in other industries that I've worked in,
[SPEAKER_05]: that there's a sense of connection and
community and cannabis that doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily exist in the oil and gas
industry or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you have to understand both how to
be a good person when you are breaking up
[SPEAKER_05]: with somebody.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to be the bad breakup guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not good in business.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably not good in any facet of
life as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you also want to have an exit plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think that means every
relationship you get in, you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately start thinking, how am I going
to get out of this?
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you do find yourself in a
partnership and it's not working for you,
[SPEAKER_05]: you need a plan on how you're going to end
that relationship so that it's done in a
[SPEAKER_05]: manner that's respectful, a manner that's
mutually beneficial, and so that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: not screwing yourself along the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you fire your lawyer because you're
aggravated with your lawyer and you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: have a new lawyer in place or someone to
take all of that paperwork from them,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to need a lawyer at some
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't have a new one,
you could be picking your next attorney
[SPEAKER_05]: too quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could be picking your next director of
cultivation, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so understanding, sometimes if a
relationship's not working, even being
[SPEAKER_05]: upfront about it, hey, I think at the end
of this quarter we should part ways so
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody has notice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're not jumping the gun on somebody.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, you need to put a
plan in place of succession.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if it's you leaving your
organization, there has to be some kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: a plan of what you're going to do next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that spar any questions from anybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you're loud.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it is really understanding our
vision as an organization and
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding that we're putting consumers
first in everything that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then being a great communicator,
people that can really go back and forth
[SPEAKER_03]: and don't snowball and be willing to come
in and communicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking for people that have longevity
and loyalty and able to communicate and
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the things I'm really looking
for in my associates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to sound really strange,
but I look for people that have long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean that on a private and a
business level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm dealing with someone and they
go, yeah, my best friend I've known for
[SPEAKER_00]: two years, that's not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an indicator for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they have several friends that
they've known for 30 or 40 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: that has some real teeth to it and has
some traction for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say that I look for emotional
intelligence when I'm hiring for
[SPEAKER_06]: employees.
[SPEAKER_06]: We try not.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do a pretty thorough interview along
with a panel interview so that we are
[SPEAKER_06]: getting different points of view on a
candidate and not one person's making the
[SPEAKER_06]: decision.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then from a business perspective,
I look for references.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's usually enough data out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I look for relationships that I've used
in the past and rely heavily on those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I agree with all that, especially
the values and finding people who fit your
[SPEAKER_05]: values.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think you also have to leverage your
network and your relationships and find
[SPEAKER_05]: out what you can about these potential
individuals through your friends or talk
[SPEAKER_05]: to your friends in the industry and figure
out who they've used for those kinds of
[SPEAKER_05]: situations in the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, a recommendation from someone I
trust is a lot more important than
[SPEAKER_05]: anything someone can say in an interview.
[SPEAKER_05]: An interview, as you pointed out,
can not really be indicative of reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you want to talk to someone
they've worked for, someone they've worked
[SPEAKER_05]: with in an industry this small,
you should be able to find somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere along the line that you know or
someone that is seven degrees of Kevin
[SPEAKER_05]: Bacon away in one way or another and find
somebody who can really give you the
[SPEAKER_05]: skinny on what's going on behind the
scenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's it for our group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next panel is coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you guys for listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
