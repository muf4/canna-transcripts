[SPEAKER_04]: He's one of the preeminent doctors that
not only started the movement,
[SPEAKER_04]: but sustained the movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: This gentleman is not only one of the most
erudite physicians regarding cannabis in
[SPEAKER_04]: the world, but he is an activist,
okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the reason we are all here today is
because of the activist.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would not be here today if a lot of
people didn't go to prison, if a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people didn't hit the streets,
if a lot of people didn't come out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: closet just in your own social circle and
say, hey, I smoke weed and I'm a normal,
[SPEAKER_04]: good, decent person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know all of you probably do not smoke
weed and that's fine, but the point is
[SPEAKER_04]: just understanding the value of cannabis
and understanding how far we still need to
[SPEAKER_04]: go when it comes to activism.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's been no person in Germany
that's done a better job than Dr. Franjo
[SPEAKER_04]: Grotenhammer and we're very pleased today
to present him with the ICBC Lifetime
[SPEAKER_04]: Achievement Award for Cannabis Activism.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please give it up for Dr. Franjo
Grotenhammer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Franjo Grotenhammer, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Alex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would like to use the opportunity
to present some of my hobbies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are called Association for Cannabis
Medicine or ISM and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to use the opportunity to
raise your attention to something which is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening now in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening inside Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only happening for those who speak
German and it may be that you are not
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of it what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start with a quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to read it so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from some guidelines on cannabis and
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reads the following.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to a considerable variability of the
concentration of the active compound by
[SPEAKER_00]: preparation procedures, the risk of
overdoses, but also due to possible
[SPEAKER_00]: impurities and the range of variation of
the concentration of the active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients in the plant fraction,
and due to possible overlaps with the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational use, the prescription of
cannabis flowers for medical purposes is
[SPEAKER_00]: not recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recommend dronobinol and Sativex,
standardized cannabis extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the same guidelines there as written,
there is no scientific basis that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical use of cannabis flowers seem
meaningful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you other examples of this tendency
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first, some of my, a little bit of
my history.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did with the German ACM and the
ICM, for example, we did some conferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see here the first conference I
organized in 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see Roger Pertwee and Raphael
Metschelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course in 2017, the ICM conference
was much larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's most about bringing scientists and
physicians together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next is, of course, information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see some of my books, which are
usually only available in Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: in German, but some of them are also
available in English or Spanish or French.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ICM built, which is published
since the year 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no, there's no better source.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search for anything, cannabis in
colitis or to bolster, draw more anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can search the ICM.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next is, of course, political action.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, my last petition was before the
Petition Committee of the German
[SPEAKER_00]: Bundestag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2016, there was the hearing on the
new law in Germany, which took effect in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in the last 20 years, we spent about
50,000 euros a year, about 1 million in 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years, to allow you to earn 100 to 1,000
million euros in the next five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All German experts on the medical use of
cannabis and cannabis have signed a
[SPEAKER_00]: consultancy agreement with the main
producer of dronabinol in Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: except one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who prefers to remain independent?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also contacted, but decided to
remain independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a quote from a workshop on
cannabis in medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientifically, the use of cannabis
flowers is tone age therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a contrast between flowers and
dronabinol Sativex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a statement of a health insurer,
a doctor wanted to prescribe cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, and the health insurer told him,
more economical and better scientifically
[SPEAKER_00]: studied alternatives to cannabis are
basically Sativex and dronabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what is needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Reliable information, the medical value of
cannabis, for the public, patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians, politicians, journalists,
and health insurers, unbiased education of
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors, actions for further improve
access to medical cannabis, and
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperation between patients, doctors,
and scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm here because I want your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need another one million euro in six
months to allow you to earn another 100 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,000 million euros in the next five
years, not in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to have a cannabis center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to bring all my hobbies,
organizations together to build up a
[SPEAKER_00]: website and information center where you
get the best information as patient,
[SPEAKER_00]: as physician, as health insurer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, this is only available in
German.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a English site which is only
available for some time, but of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: the center will be in German.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One personal note.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm suffering from a chronic
illness for more than 25 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and after 25 years of extensive search,
I finally found an active treatment which
[SPEAKER_00]: will allow me to continue my work for
another 20 years, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Dr. Goldham,
and we really appreciate all your hard
[SPEAKER_03]: work and your studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that brings it into today's
conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all again, and we'll see you
tonight at the after party at the Gretchen
[SPEAKER_03]: tonight at 830, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go eat and smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you again, doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
