[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, alright, alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's everyone feeling out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all feeling good today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, y'all glad to be in Germany while we
had just legalized it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all feeling good in Germany because we
just legalized it?
[SPEAKER_00]: ICBC, yo, I'm gonna tell you something y
'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came here in 2016 and I had a dream and
a vision to bring B2B cannabis to Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: because we know that the market fuels the
politics, the policy fuels the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are, seven years later,
under legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I came in 2016, everyone thought
I was crazy, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember, I remember Georg Wurz
saying to me, Alex, I'm very worried for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: $500 a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very, how you say, gunstig people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well Georg, I'm worried too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: We built a whole movement around B2B
cannabis in Germany and here we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2017, we had the first ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I got lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened was medical marijuana
basically was legalized just before the
[SPEAKER_00]: first ICBC in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew that eventually cannabis would
be legal in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a feeling it would be the first real
market that cannabis would become legal
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know there's ambiguity or semantics
whether it's legal or not now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it has opened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know it's been decriminalized now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know cannabis has taken off the
narcotics list in Germany, which is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the greatest public policy achievements
regarding cannabis in world history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the social clubs phase one,
phase two, but we also have that medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana is going to get a huge boost now
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of my favorite things that's
happening, a lot of people don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that criminal penalties have been
reduced for cannabis also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where you have a truly
progressive society where we understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that prohibition doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop locking people up for using an herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was then one thing I said when I
got on stage in 2017 at the Maritime Pro
[SPEAKER_00]: Arte.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you out there I know were actually
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was at the first ICBC in 2017?
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, awesome, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was I.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said there's two most important
things when it comes to changing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really comes from an activist
perspective, not from a business
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, this is what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said the policymakers are going to fuck
things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the nature of the bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the nature of politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, but what's most important is that
we end criminal penalties towards cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone can grow plants at their
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I believe growing cannabis at your
house is a fundamental human right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Hare was my mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1993, I met Jack Hare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, the gruff old bastard,
was pretty much right about everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said hemp could save the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I wasn't sure if hemp could really
save the planet then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I liked to smoke hemp back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew I liked to hang out with Jack
Hare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of the band of rascals that he
was touring around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 30 years ago, I was on Hate Ashbury
with my dreadlocks telling everybody to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize cannabis because it would save
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody was laughing at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nobody's laughing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, please give yourself
a big round of applause because the ICBC
[SPEAKER_00]: is nothing without you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Alex Rogers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the owner and founder of the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without further ado, I would like to bring
up our longtime emcee, every single ICBC
[SPEAKER_00]: show, my friend for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please give a warm Berlin welcome to our
one and only Ungayo Bilal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, good morning, bonjour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any other languages.
