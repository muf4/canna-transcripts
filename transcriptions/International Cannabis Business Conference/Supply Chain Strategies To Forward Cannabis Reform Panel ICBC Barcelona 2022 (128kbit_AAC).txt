[SPEAKER_00]: Journalists, activists, German citizen,
and all around great person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for Marguerite Arnold.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a couple of people who are going
to be joining us here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't leave me out here by myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's my panel?
[SPEAKER_04]: There they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's my panel?
[SPEAKER_04]: There they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: The boys.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're so shy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're still missing one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's Clint?
[SPEAKER_01]: Clint's still missing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clint is still missing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we wait?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we start?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should start.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is everyone enjoying Barcelona?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my first time here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't this awesome to be back?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we hear a round of applause for the
awesome team that pulled this off?
[SPEAKER_05]: ICBC rocks, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm also hoping that we're going to
wake all of you up because it's been a
[SPEAKER_05]: long awesome day of networking and
whatever, but I want to have your input.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think somebody's got a mic on the
bottom, but if not, just get up and be
[SPEAKER_05]: loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea here is we're going to have a
discussion about supply chain strategies
[SPEAKER_05]: that could drive legalization,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want to be really creative about
this in an environment in Europe,
[SPEAKER_05]: for those of you who don't know,
where a case called the Cannavape case in
[SPEAKER_05]: France actually drove a decision about CBD
on an EU level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually picking up for the excellent
panel that we just had with everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: before the last speaker, that's actually I
think the suing discussion and the
[SPEAKER_05]: import-export discussion is one of the
best ways that I would say legacy cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: and I would say maybe cultural cannabis
can have an impact on the corporate side
[SPEAKER_05]: because if your case is in the news and
you sue and you win, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a pretty big impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: On, you know, corporate cannabis from an
import-export perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Regardless, as a result of that situation,
obviously one of the issues in the market
[SPEAKER_05]: right now is when you import and export
across borders, there are a couple of very
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting conversations that open up,
both whether what you're allowed to do
[SPEAKER_05]: from a legalization perspective like CBD
across borders and then eventually THC and
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe even niche markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I'd like to do actually is open
this up with the first question about
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your feeling about, as I would
say, the strategy of sue the bastards as
[SPEAKER_05]: you're importing and exporting even if you
have to defend yourself?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that an interesting way do you think to
drive markets as well as legalization?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be happy to go first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sue the bastards is not really the
European strategy on many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to align ourselves with certain
standards and certain existing structures
[SPEAKER_01]: and try to find a smooth way in and if
shit hits the fan, you can still,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, protect yourself and sue if that
is an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end of the day, I believe to be
able to open this industry, be it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, the THC or in any other part of the
industry, we should really try to find
[SPEAKER_01]: existing standards, existing products that
are aligned with those products and then
[SPEAKER_01]: find a way around that and then really
align yourself with that because in the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the day, suing is another strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe not the first one to go with,
but keep your interests in line and
[SPEAKER_01]: protect yourself, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Kai in the audience?
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you who don't know,
there's a lawyer who is suing the
[SPEAKER_05]: government over the hemp question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe he would disagree, but regardless,
what do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So my first reaction is that if I look at
the Canadian market, the whole cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: act in Canada started from the suing
people suing the government to allow them
[SPEAKER_03]: access to medication.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, I mean, the thing is that I think
that the cannabis market in Europe in
[SPEAKER_03]: general basically, not only in Europe
around the world, is what I called Swiss
[SPEAKER_03]: cheese because it's more horse than cheese
and there's no certain body of regulation,
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly not about moving products from
one country to another that organize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can sue, like if you're going back
to your first suggestion of suing the
[SPEAKER_03]: bastards, you can sue the German
government, but it won't change anything
[SPEAKER_03]: about Holland, Denmark or these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got a question for you there,
but what about then if let's say you sue
[SPEAKER_05]: and lose and then you appeal?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you appeal to the EU level,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's really where you want to
go, but you have to sue at a country level
[SPEAKER_05]: first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, again, I agree that suing,
I mean, the major thing that suing will
[SPEAKER_03]: give you is coverage in the news and
basically bringing the cannabis into the
[SPEAKER_03]: main conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people will talk about it on TV,
people will talk about it in radio show,
[SPEAKER_03]: talk show, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you will have some kind of audience
that are basically going behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the point of suing is that you
have to have an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot sue the government because I
want, I can sue the government if I want
[SPEAKER_03]: as a person something that the government
doesn't allow me, but I cannot sue the
[SPEAKER_03]: government based on imaginary crowd.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to your point about this, I mean,
the whole point about this is it is a
[SPEAKER_05]: Swiss cheese and the people who found
themselves in those lawsuit situations did
[SPEAKER_05]: not do it on purpose, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They ended up thinking that they could and
then they got caught and then sued and
[SPEAKER_05]: then that's how they want, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question is, have you guys ever been
involved in that kind of lawsuit or?
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, no, but like I said,
I mean, the whole system in Canada was
[SPEAKER_03]: based on people suing the government for
one thing, then the government obviously
[SPEAKER_03]: lost the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to change some kind of
regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then people found, you know, they were
allowed smoking, people, someone smoke,
[SPEAKER_03]: sue the government.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you force my 70-year-old child to
smoke?
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously you won the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how the government initially
eventually kind of allow oil, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is, you have to have a private
standing that my case has to find a
[SPEAKER_03]: solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, I don't know if you remember,
there was a couple of months ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lady that came back to England with a
child.
[SPEAKER_03]: She flew to America to give her child CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was arrested as she landed in Heathrow
and the child was given to some kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: social security, social services and
immediately it went to the press and
[SPEAKER_03]: within seven days they changed the law in
England.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's another kind of import-export
strategy that it's probably a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: more risky, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: The personal one as opposed to the
corporate one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on to the next issue,
which is we were discussing this back in
[SPEAKER_05]: the green room.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things, the impacts of the
development of the medical market in
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany, what that has done is it's driven
feeder markets all the way around Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, all over the world right now,
who are trying to get medical product into
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that has driven reform in places like
Columbia or South Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're sitting at the end here and like,
how do you think that why do you think,
[SPEAKER_05]: for example, it's important for the
industry, I think, to be aware.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly, it's not something you can
stretch out of your realm to do,
[SPEAKER_05]: but if you're in the way of it,
I mean, those are really finding,
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say, important trigger markets to
see reform and will drive reform in other
[SPEAKER_05]: places and obviously that's involved in
the import-export discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada, Germany or etc.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to actually take one step back to
the question before about suing or not
[SPEAKER_01]: suing, because just one little thing that
maybe the Swiss cheese is what triggered
[SPEAKER_01]: it there a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've done, the industry association
has put together a paper where we analyzed
[SPEAKER_01]: all the different standards that are out
there and we put them in perspective to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and then medical cannabis and
what's coming with recreational and we
[SPEAKER_01]: made a bottom-up forward motion,
not a suing counter-reactive approach,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a bottom-up approach that kind of
brings the industry forward and allows
[SPEAKER_01]: consensus and based on that then creates
standards that we can work with between
[SPEAKER_01]: the different countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the import-export regulation in
anything that has to do with EUGMP,
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say it's the easiest way to do
things because it's already been defined,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's already been done, it's been a proven
concept, the laws are there, the different
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, the exchange between the
countries is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, of course, the hardest to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs the most different stages of your
compliance, it needs the most different
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of your production, control over
every single aspect of your operation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in the end of the day, at least it's
defined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a big thing that is missing at
the moment is that the definition of what
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be done in compliance or
standardization if you want to go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, medical is clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical is clear, medical has been done,
that's the open trade route at the moment,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what happens with recreational?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we go tobacco laws?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we go narcotic laws?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we go full EUGMP?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's the more interesting
part right now to see on the policymaking
[SPEAKER_01]: and then opening different trade routes is
how do we define these different products
[SPEAKER_01]: and how do we build a harmonized system
between the different countries about that
[SPEAKER_01]: and learn from what the US has been doing
or what have they, I believe they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing wrong with that, no choice,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's federally illegal, you cannot move it
from one state to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our chance in Europe right now to
kind of learn from that, but we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: find a regulatory, not a regulatory
framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the issue, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the issue is like how do you
find that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you define that in a way that
everyone agrees with you?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure that there are lots of opinions
here about whether GACP or GMP is going to
[SPEAKER_05]: lead the recreational discussion across
borders, even in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to grow everything that
Germans are going to consume, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So where's that going to come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in a way I agree with what Luke
said.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean definitely the lack of regulation
across Europe is one object to look at it
[SPEAKER_03]: or hurdle that we have to cross,
but in a way if we, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: I know like we said before, the cannabis
that will end up in the coffee shop in
[SPEAKER_03]: Holland will end up to be GACP compliance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you comply with your product and you
convince the authorities or the government
[SPEAKER_03]: instead of suing them, convince them that
the product is good, then obviously the
[SPEAKER_03]: demand will drive the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think another point of view that we can
talk about definitely is the veterinarian
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that there's 60 million cats in
Europe, as pets, not as stray cats.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a huge market, a veterinary
product for pets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if CBD is good for dogs or CBD is good
for whatever, the coat of the cats,
[SPEAKER_03]: the demand will create some kind of
allowance in the law rather than sue them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is basically my approach is to
convince consumers that that product meets
[SPEAKER_03]: some basic standards, that it's safe,
that it's controlled, and therefore it
[SPEAKER_03]: should be legalized.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's, and this is sort of intertwined,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's say the German market wakes up to
the beauties of CBD pet food, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And people try to buy it, they try to buy
it on Amazon and there's nothing in
[SPEAKER_05]: Germany, so they buy it from Holland.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that package crosses the border
and someone gets caught because the
[SPEAKER_05]: Germans still have not decided what CBD
is.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the lawsuit thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But to your point, I think what you're
suggesting is maybe the development of
[SPEAKER_05]: niche markets could also drive,
I guess, consumer demand.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then in that environment, particularly
in the situation where we just referenced,
[SPEAKER_05]: there is no standard yet on a European
level, welcome to lawsuit city again,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody is gonna get sued or a firm is
gonna get sued.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why this is coming up again.
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's move beyond that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I wanted to get onto the
idea of what do you guys think is going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be the first kind of regulated cannabis to
cross borders in the recreational side?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it gonna be GACP THC or EUGMP THC?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, like I said, if I look at my
involvement with a project in Holland,
[SPEAKER_03]: it will be GACP EU because GACP is a
standard that is recognized by the EMA or
[SPEAKER_03]: European medicinal agency and is
acceptable all across Europe, obviously in
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, if... But you had the narcotic
question as you brought up before,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is it a narcotic?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it not a narcotic?
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly on the THC side, you're gonna be
running into what exactly is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it's defined or as long as that
is the same level in the UN as it has
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, it will be, it's a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's classified as a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Switzerland, we have the pilot project,
which is like a Swiss white or a
[SPEAKER_01]: nationwide study on how a legalization
could go forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a very clear regulatory part
where this is the actual narcotics parts
[SPEAKER_01]: that you need to report.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the bottom up approach,
you have the GACP that you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually comply with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Switzerland threw in there some,
you have to do it organic, so it has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: grown outside or at least in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have added a few different layers of
making sure that the industry stays local
[SPEAKER_01]: in that in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not being imported.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the next point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was one of the things.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it's in the regulatory
framework it is right now, the import and
[SPEAKER_01]: export is a very difficult thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to single out conventionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make those different
agreements between the countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that both countries need to
have the same agreements on how they
[SPEAKER_01]: declare it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of that, once we actually agree
it's a very important thing.
So that's the next point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next point is the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to transform a plant into a
medicinal product, you follow the GACP
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is set.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has been done for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of smart people came up with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have that as a standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go, what is the end product
that you want to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see where it takes you,
be it in a consumer product, be it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical product, and then you follow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I think the most important
thing is we should stop all trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: our own thing and really see, OK,
this has been done in food.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been done in tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been done in the medical
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just try to wiggle our way
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, now I declare it on this side as this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I import it as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I distribute it at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the end, I complain that I get
sued or that I go to jail for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, you just wiggled your way
around it, but you didn't find a clear,
[SPEAKER_01]: straight line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to define that straight line
and then approach the regulator and set
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you bring up a very, very key point
about strategy in the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally, a lot of success is also made
by finding that loophole initially,
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not disagreeing with you at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for example, how do you bring in a
plant as a pharmaceutical product or an
[SPEAKER_05]: API?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's lots of, I would say, loopholes
that exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, because of the lack of regulatory
standard across the EU, which gets to,
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, the uber point here, which is
certainly within the context of the EU and
[SPEAKER_05]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you see as the trends for XM going
forward as policies change and vice versa?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that, for example,
the example I gave before, Germany changed
[SPEAKER_05]: its medical law, and all of a sudden you
have a ring of markets trying to get their
[SPEAKER_05]: product into Germany, which is driven
reform.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you see that as a pattern going forward
or not, and why?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess whenever a market opens,
right, there is a lot of people that want
[SPEAKER_01]: to get access to it one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we see a lot of different
approaches and a lot of different ways of
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing the product to Germany or
bringing the product via X to Z and then
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing it to Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is, yeah, as you said,
you can wiggle your way, and there is
[SPEAKER_01]: loopholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, as long as we
build an industry based on wiggling and
[SPEAKER_01]: loopholes, we don't have an economically
sustainable business structure behind it
[SPEAKER_01]: that will not allow other, it's not even
about corporate entities, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just about supporting business
structures that we need to actually grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and bring this to a further level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as we try to find those ways
around, it will be really hard to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: create a real industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, those ways are there, and as long
as there is opportunities, those ways are
[SPEAKER_01]: being filled, but the more we follow those
paths, the more also there's always the
[SPEAKER_01]: other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see told you so, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis guys again, or the cannabis
ladies, sorry, but the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: again, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll find their way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They found their way for 30, 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really not what we wanted going
into the future, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or that's what I believe is we have that
chance right now to change the tone,
[SPEAKER_01]: to change the actual, not just to change
the tonality, but also to change the image
[SPEAKER_01]: of the industry, the German coalition that
came out together and said, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to do this together.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the US, it's the only thing that the
actual both sides agree on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a big shift in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as we wiggle our ways around
it, and we don't really try to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: clear path, I think it's quite damaging,
potentially damaging for the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're answering the question.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're actually saying maybe that XM
strategies to drive reform might be
[SPEAKER_05]: damaging, and it would be better for
individual countries like Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_05]: like Holland, to develop a strong GACP
policy internally that deals with
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, but it still leaves that
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're not growing, like say Germany,
and you've got reform, I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: what are people supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Import seeds and grow their own?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's my question.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, what is the cannabis,
especially THC, in this environment that
[SPEAKER_05]: will be allowed to cross borders?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or won't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, maybe it's like the US states.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Holland has its reform,
Switzerland has its reform, Germany has
[SPEAKER_05]: its reform, etc.
[SPEAKER_05]: And any cannabis caught going across the
border for recreational use puts you in
[SPEAKER_05]: jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that sustainable long term either?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, I think that, of course,
I agree with you that people should have a
[SPEAKER_03]: stand when they sue.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I do tend to agree with Luke that
the industry as a whole, rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: individual, try to set the tone or set the
rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we're looking at the other flip
side, the other side of it, Infamed and
[SPEAKER_03]: Israel just announced recently that they
allow CBD, but they not allow it to use
[SPEAKER_03]: for cosmetic use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now what?
[SPEAKER_03]: All the CBD out of the shampoo,
or people will try to find a loophole.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, same thing in Israel.
[SPEAKER_03]: They allow, they decriminalize cannabis,
but they excluded cosmetic product from,
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD are not allowed to use in cosmetic
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, the government are also trying
to go kind of one step forward,
[SPEAKER_03]: two step backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think also the government themselves
don't know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that is frequently, obviously,
right, the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to, are there any questions,
comments from the audience so far?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one in the back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stand up, speak up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering as far as once we do
get to import export, crossing those
[SPEAKER_02]: borders, at what point does it go from the
home, like at what point does the
[SPEAKER_02]: ownership switch from where that product
was first, where the product is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: end up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that switch in the air, does it
switch when?
[SPEAKER_03]: So to answer your question first,
when you, when you ship medicinal product,
[SPEAKER_03]: or for that case, medicinal cannabis,
it has to comply with GDP, good
[SPEAKER_03]: distribution practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the same law that apply for when you
send, I don't know, aspirin from India to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to Argentina, it has to comply with some
certain legislation of good distribution
[SPEAKER_03]: practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the law that the government,
the same thing with, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_03]: not recreational medicinal cannabis when
it comes from Colombia to Germany,
[SPEAKER_03]: or from Lesotho to Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just, I think whenever you have an
import and export situation, you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: buyer and a seller, then you have
incoterms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The incoterms, is it FOB, is it free on
board, is it with, you know, the freight
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance and taxes, it depends what you
actually agree on in the contract,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the buying-selling agreement with
whoever you sell it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when does the actual responsibility and
when does the payments and all of that go
[SPEAKER_01]: from one side to the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is on you to put it into a contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the things that I meant
before when I said as long as we try to
[SPEAKER_01]: wiggle our ways around, we do not have
access to institutions that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: protect you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In any other big commodity industry,
you have an LC, a letter of credit,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you have somebody that guarantees
that, and you do an incoterm based on
[SPEAKER_01]: that, the risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of those things, all of those
things that will allow for a flourishing
[SPEAKER_01]: industry can only happen if we,
it's not just, it's not we agreeing on
[SPEAKER_01]: certain terms, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been all done before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all been all done in other
industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have to kind of.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the normalization of the
industry and accepting those, adapting
[SPEAKER_05]: those existing laws to it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So who, but I mean, I think, for example,
to answer your question also, if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: importing medical cannabis into Germany,
there is a very, very complex discussion
[SPEAKER_05]: about who you're importing from.
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea of chain of title is very well,
I would say established and there's not a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of country hopping right now in
Europe, but that's another conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there another question?
[SPEAKER_01]: I might just add one thing to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of logistics people out
there that tell you, yeah, I'll ship it
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll ship it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as you don't see the
declaration form on the import side,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you always have two sides and
specifically if you go with narcotics or
[SPEAKER_01]: if you go in anything that is on a higher
compliance level, you want to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that whoever you sell to either has an
agent on the other side, a customs agent,
[SPEAKER_01]: or that the person that wants to sell you
that logistical services provides you with
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise they'll take the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll ship the shipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once it's in the air or somewhere in
between, they'll say like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you didn't declare it on the other
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll have a nice lawyer that
will tell you, here, look, I'll help you
[SPEAKER_01]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the end, you lose a lot of money
and your product is also gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at how it's done in many of the other
industries and then kind of try to follow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get creative.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get creative importing narcotics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be creative on that side.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_05]: No?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, where is the audience from mostly?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this mostly European or US?
[SPEAKER_05]: US?
[SPEAKER_05]: European?
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit of a mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from the US audience perspective,
though, this whole idea of shipping across
[SPEAKER_05]: borders is still pretty unique,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe if you can maybe elaborate a
little bit more on what the procedures
[SPEAKER_05]: are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, are we running out of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have like 10 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you have a question, Dayo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they told me you guys were taking
questions already.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we're taking questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're continuing with that conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an open, creative, cannabis sort of.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't come for a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't come with a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How dare you?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were we talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did someone have a question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'd already taken one question from
the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody in the very, very back there was
raising the hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finish your question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you interrupted our conversation.
Go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stage is yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that whole import, export, or supply
chain, or market access is a big subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually kind of what I base my
whole what we're doing on was I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to make a sales pitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we created a compliance software with
the whole focus of how can we solve the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem of market accessibility?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we create something that allows
for standardization along the supply chain
[SPEAKER_01]: and along the different players in the
supply chain?
[SPEAKER_01]: That then allows them to work with each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the back end also have an automated
reporting system that then allows you to
[SPEAKER_01]: access new markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all on a very standardized,
but nothing new, nothing too cutting edge
[SPEAKER_01]: over the top, something that's auditable
by the government because they want to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that if they want to allow you to ship to
certain places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really take a slow approach,
slow and steady, and get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't try to hoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try to jump the hoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't try to go too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which sometimes, like the Canavap
case, it's great if a precedent case has
[SPEAKER_01]: been formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end of the day, it's really
about slowly building this industry from
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground up and not taking shortcuts
because that will just bring you,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, what's that game with the ladder?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go too fast, you can fall very
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So slow and steady.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: On that note, I definitely agree again
with Luke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's basically what I said
initially.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we convince the authorities whether the
local government or the federal government
[SPEAKER_03]: that that product is good, kosher,
up to standard, then obviously there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: better way for us to, again, as an
industry, to persuade and change the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, maybe someone pick up the
glove of a veterinarian product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, people like in America,
they have a lot of pets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they do that there for CBD product,
for dogs, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think that, again, I am coming
from the medicinal background.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do any of the recreation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything that I do is about
compliance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I find that the only way to
change the market and then change the
[SPEAKER_03]: attitude is basically to convince the
regulators that we do our part.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you see, this is a domestic
discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, I think, what we're saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a much more domestic discussion
than cross-border discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: But obviously, we get into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Was there another question from the back?
[SPEAKER_05]: No?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think from an American perspective,
it's a state-by-state conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a conversation still, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to sell in Colorado,
you have to grow in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot cross borders with anything
except, I guess, at this point,
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: The THC discussion, still a state-by-state
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you look at places like
Mississippi, obviously, they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: regulated yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're regulated for medicinal,
but you're not regulated for adult use.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you look across the town from the
other states, just across the road,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see that people from that state
are actually driving 50 miles just to
[SPEAKER_03]: cross the border and get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those crazy Americans, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a different story, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a big chance for us in Europe
to do something different and to really
[SPEAKER_01]: not follow suit and not, you know,
find a harmonized system that works across
[SPEAKER_01]: borders and that allows for the trade to
flourish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think that's what events like
this and panels like this in general
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance efforts and standardization
efforts are all about and should be about,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding something that works for everyone
and then make that actionable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then based on that, create something
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's still disagreement about,
I mean, there's a lot of disagreement.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are those, for example,
who have, for those of you who don't know,
[SPEAKER_05]: imported, I would say, GACP product into
certain countries here in Europe and then
[SPEAKER_05]: transformed that into EUGMP and then
shipped it somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a helpful strategy or is that a
confusing one, speaking about industry
[SPEAKER_05]: coalescence around common practices?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I read a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a saying that every revolution
has three stages.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first stage, they fight you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, the first stage is they ignore you.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second stage, they fight you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third stage, they take you for
granted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that what I feel is that the
recreational market should take a step
[SPEAKER_03]: back and figure out that we've done quite
a long way since, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: 2010 or 2006 or 2015 to what we are today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been only seven years.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I look at, again, after the 1930 with
the drought laws in the state,
[SPEAKER_03]: it took the liquor companies 15 years to
pick up with demands.
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 years and now, obviously, you can buy
liquor store anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: But 15 years, people had to do beers and
alcohol in their backyard because there
[SPEAKER_03]: was not enough product in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, we as a driven the market or
helping forming the market, we have to
[SPEAKER_03]: take a step back and realize that we did
quite a long way and we have to be
[SPEAKER_03]: patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wise words from a wise man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think maybe we're at the end of
this conversation unless you'd like to add
[SPEAKER_05]: anything else.
No?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been a great audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And speaking about import-export
strategies to drive legalization,
[SPEAKER_05]: there is a super, super event coming up
next.
[SPEAKER_05]: With a rather well-known import from the
United States and from Germany at this
[SPEAKER_05]: point.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll leave it up to you to take that
one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it again for Luke and Shlomo
and Marguerite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very informative, very passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait for international cannabis so
I can go to the local and buy some
[SPEAKER_00]: Moroccan hash while I'm in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we used to be able to buy Moroccan
hash, but it was way against the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's legal and you have to come
out here to get it, which is fine because
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, I have to go to Barcelona and smoke
some hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever will I do?
