[SPEAKER_01]: The next speaker Turpeen's in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the founder and chief science
officer for Cascadia Labs, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: leading lab in both Oregon and now moving
into California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please give a warm welcome to Mr. Jeremy
Sackett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Anthony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Jeremy Sackett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, founder and chief science officer
of Cascadia Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me just open this notes up real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be talking about Turpeen's
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get the conversation started,
just one moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have my notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's just get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have here in front of us some terms,
chemo intensity, chemo diversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and chemo frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're playing off of chemo type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemo type is the chemical composition of
phytochemicals in the cannabis plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: will include Turpeen's and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These chemo intensity, chemo diversity,
and chemo frequency relate to how much the
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity or the concentration of those
phytochemicals are in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: the diversity of how varied the ratio of
those phytochemicals in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the chemo frequency, how often they
occur in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're going to talk about today
with this basic understanding of using the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemo type in order to characterize the
plant in a way that we can better convey
[SPEAKER_00]: that information through a labeling system
ultimately to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to bring my notes up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a quick second.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking through what I wanted to talk
about in this segment, I had to come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with something that would be the most
impactful in a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to touch on a few points
here that will support the ongoing
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation of how we characterize and
label cannabis items, specifically flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the chemical composition in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will ultimately lead to a better
understanding for the consumer of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients or the phytochemical profile,
the chemo type of the product that they
[SPEAKER_00]: consume, which will ultimately lead to the
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not the name of the plant that
leads to your experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what's in that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to start, just a little bit of basic
background info on terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're flavor and fragrance compounds
found throughout nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very large chemical classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in plants and animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cholesterol, for example, is an
animal-derived terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the common terpenes that we're
thinking about in plants were generated
[SPEAKER_00]: for a plant protection and reproduction
purposes through evolution of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some examples are the sesquiterpenes,
a more bitter terpene in the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: branches of the plants, may inhibit
grazing because they're bitter and the
[SPEAKER_00]: animals won't eat that foliage,
where the more sweet-smelling terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: that may be produced in the flowers will
attract pollinators and allow that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to reproduce more successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at chemo intensity,
chemo diversity, and chemo frequency,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's genetic factors and environmental
factors that influence the presentation of
[SPEAKER_00]: that chemotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have here an example of two samples of
jacar√®re, one from farm one and farm two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that the intensity,
my pointer might not reach, the intensity
[SPEAKER_00]: from farm one is close to 2% where farm
two is not even quite to 1% total.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see that the intensity is quite
different, and you may be able to see that
[SPEAKER_00]: the diversity is similar, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue band at the bottom, the light
blue bands, the darker blue bands,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then kind of those aquas and greens
going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be hard to see in this graph,
but the data behind it, they are very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the environmental factors in the
growing conditions here impacted the total
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, how do we use that
ecological influence on plants grown
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be considered in a similar fashion
to the Appalachians in wine or the terars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we represent the use
[SPEAKER_00]: of the terpenes to the consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get that information forward to
the consumer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivators, distributors, and retailers,
in my opinion, will be really well served
[SPEAKER_00]: when they can highlight to the market
those unique genetic and environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations that come together to provide
a unique product for that consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the consumer can then identify with
that product that they find a desirable
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome with, they can then go back and
find that product from other farms or
[SPEAKER_00]: different retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or otherwise, if that product is not
available and it was of this certain name,
[SPEAKER_00]: branded name, some silly fun name,
but on the back there was a simple to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand label that identified the
cannabinoid and terpene content in an easy
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand manner, they could then not
worry about that silly name and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to be the THC percent
that's on the front of most jars and most
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries that's going to convey that
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's come up with a better solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we're going to get to
today, hopefully, or at least start the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a competitive marketplace,
how do you find success as a flower
[SPEAKER_00]: producer?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, of course, product quality leading
up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cultivator story and the
phytochemical makeup are two very
[SPEAKER_00]: important parts of that product as it
comes to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your story of your team, your production
practices, brand placement, what
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries, and how does the product
look in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what are the phytochemicals,
the makeup, the diversity of the products
[SPEAKER_00]: that you bring to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it all a nursing dominant THC rich
product, and you have 10 of them that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing, and that's really all
you're producing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you diversify and have some CBD THC
and some CBD with predominant cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: with different terpene profiles?
[SPEAKER_00]: And understanding that as a cultivator and
bringing that forward to a market that is
[SPEAKER_00]: informed of what you're bringing forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, regulatory compliance and good
business practices will also lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's dive into a little bit of the
terpenes characterization in the hemotype
[SPEAKER_00]: characterization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't put a slide together about type
1, type 2, or type 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: These type 1, type 2, and type 3
characterization are for cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in scientific literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to come out in some
conversations in industry, and even being
[SPEAKER_00]: used in some labeling systems by some
organizations thus far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type 1 is a THC predominant cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: A type 2 is a THC and CBD mixed type
cultivar of various ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: A type 3 is a CBD predominant cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a type 4 that is being developed
that is CBG rich, and there's likely going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be type 5, type 6 as further breeding
experiments move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all based on the genetic makeup of
the plant, type 1, type 2, type 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we get to the end of this
presentation today, you'll see the type 1,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2, and 3 as a component of a possible
labeling system to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have an example of a terpenalene
leading set of different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenalene lead means that it's the
most concentrated terpene in these
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars, and typically we see about nine
or so different terpenes that are always
[SPEAKER_00]: the most concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's going to be other
terpenes that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're likely going to have some effect,
be it the flavor, the fragrance,
[SPEAKER_00]: or some physiological effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're really trying to distill down
a set of very complex phytochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: information, analytical information,
into a labeling system or a nomenclature
[SPEAKER_00]: system that can be conveyed through the
supply chain and ultimately to the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer, I would propose that we condense
down to nine or so different terpenes that
[SPEAKER_00]: we could use on the label and represent
what are the most concentrated of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very consistently leading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the terpenalene lead, I chose this just
because I like terpenalene leading
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I threw it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenalene is found in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may think of limonene from lemons and
pining from pines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are relatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of understand where those are
coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenalene is a little bit less scarce as
far as known sources, but it's out there
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lot of different types of plants,
some examples here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see the Jack Herrera and the
Black Widow, the Moon Puppies,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Black Cherry Soda, those are all
different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were sitting on the shelf,
how would you really tell the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd see maybe the name, the THC and CBD
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd look at them, smell them,
maybe they look a little similar,
[SPEAKER_00]: they smell similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're really not getting the full
story there, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is in the name?
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly should keep the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings kind of the branding,
the artistic aspect of creativity into the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let the consumer find their
affiliation with the production story and
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality of the product by seeing a
very nice branded product on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there should be on the back,
in my opinion, an easy-to-understand
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling system that conveys the
phytochemicals in that plant so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer can then understand what is
making them have this experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: be it the smell or the physiological
experience that it's had.
[SPEAKER_00]: An easy-to-understand labeling system
should be developed with input by multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is starting the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a presentation of this should
be the labeling system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some ideas that I've come up with
over the last five years working in the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing industry, in the testing sector of
the cannabis industry, and working with
[SPEAKER_00]: other colleagues in developing this
chemotaxonomic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there may be differences in
labeling using the phenotype, or excuse
[SPEAKER_00]: me, the chemotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a very good system for
breeding and cultivation projects compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to the labeling system used for retail and
consumer engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they should both be based on,
you know, what is in the plant and how do
[SPEAKER_00]: we characterize, you know, the plant for
breeding purposes as well as consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes with that makeup, because that
drives the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what's on this slide here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three examples of different
samples, two purple Hindu Kush and one
[SPEAKER_00]: Udub.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that they're very similar from
these Terp donuts, kind of the visual
[SPEAKER_00]: representation, limonene-lead,
beta-cariophylline, and pinene as the
[SPEAKER_00]: three leading terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I was typically purchasing purple
Hindu Kush and I like it, I've had good
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences, I've bought it consistently
for whatever purpose, and I go in and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not there, and Udub is sitting on the
counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I to know if all it says,
you know, typically is purple Hindu Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: 17% THC grown by so-and-so?
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I to know that that Udub sitting
there at 20%, which is the same as 17,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially, and, you know, different name
grown by somebody else, is pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the same experience likely for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, having a naming system that
conveys some of the attributes other than
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC is what's gonna help us get to
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let me throw a couple examples of what
it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it might look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, back to the terpenoline-lead samples,
the Jack Carrera Moon Puppies,
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Cherry Soda, Black Widow,
they are all type one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all THC predominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're not gonna have time
in this conversation, but you'll see the
[SPEAKER_00]: range there of 15 to 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, I think that that single number
on, you know, a product out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory is misleading to the consumer,
does not do the cultivator or the retailer
[SPEAKER_00]: justice in conveying what this product is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's biological variability in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's variability in the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having one number that most people
think that there's a difference between 19
[SPEAKER_00]: and 21 in our valuing product based on
that, there really is no difference
[SPEAKER_00]: because of those variabilities of the
plant and the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's get away from a single number
and put a range on there at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, type one, type two, or type three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It represents the cannabinoid,
THC, mixture, or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: A range of the actual cannabinoids in
percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a representation of the terpenes
in either this key system that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: teasing out saying those nine terpenes,
some of them have the same first letter,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but, you know, if you come up
with a certain letter and maybe even a
[SPEAKER_00]: color that is associated with those
leading nine terpenes and then use those
[SPEAKER_00]: in a block system or some other system
that could be developed standardized by
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry and brought forward by a
collective group to better, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: convey what's in these products,
this is one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Jack Herrera and that Black Widow,
they both have a terpenaline, osmine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and mercine as their three leading
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both type one and they're both in
that, you know, 15 to 30 percent range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet they're both probably 18 to 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just because pretty much where most
cannabis is that we've seen over many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if I were I love the Jack Herrera and
I would go in and purchase that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if it's not there and Black Widow is
on the shelf, it wouldn't click in my
[SPEAKER_00]: brain that Jack Herrera and Black Widow
are similar, but if I had a labeling
[SPEAKER_00]: system that showed me those pieces of
information, I could relate those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know that I'm always a type one Tom
and I really like that, I could go in and
[SPEAKER_00]: look for a type one Tom or whatever that
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the Moon Puppies,
Black Cherry Soda, they're both
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenaline leads.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably going to have similar
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could they all be on the shelf together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the pinot categorization of wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you walk in and I know I like a pinot,
so I'm kind of going here to find which
[SPEAKER_00]: one I like and then I'll choose it based
on the cultivator story and the known
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can walk over and find your cabs
that are all your limine leads on another
[SPEAKER_00]: section in the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got 10 seconds left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably no questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be here for the rest of the afternoon
and later tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all so much for sticking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeremy Saget, one more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually really informative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing I love most about it is like
different terpenes have different smells
[SPEAKER_02]: and different effects, which is just proof
that marijuana loves us, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can just smell a bag and be
like, oh, that's the shit that makes me
[SPEAKER_02]: feel how I want to feel, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: You ever just like smell a bag and like,
oh, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you smell another one and you're like,
that's not the one that makes my body
[SPEAKER_02]: tingle, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it's all science.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, well, that's the presence of
the limine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, I just like the shit that
smells like lemons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very technical.
