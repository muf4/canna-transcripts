[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for that kind
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Alex, I couldn't have said that
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is going to happen in Germany is a
good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, and as a lawyer, you always have a
but, it is probably not as optimistic as
[SPEAKER_00]: we all thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: A year ago, I was standing here at the
same desk and was actually asking,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the government doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the government do with regard to
recreational?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of impact it may have on the
medical market?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to do with you within
the next 45 minutes is have a look at what
[SPEAKER_00]: has happened since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we expect?
[SPEAKER_00]: What may be the impacts on the viable
medical market for cannabis in Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a good German speaker, I have my
agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops, here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I give you an overview about
what has happened since a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will then have a look at the so-called
two pillar model, which is the plan of the
[SPEAKER_00]: German government to implement
recreational cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will then, of course, also have a look
into this new draft act which has been
[SPEAKER_00]: leaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not yet officially released,
but we had the chance to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, what is the time frame?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: When can we expect the opening of the
market?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is really the impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, do we have real
positive potential with regard to the
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use the short form of recreational
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is actually the use of cannabis for
adult use for recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's too long, so I just say
recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's look in what has happened in that
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we all know, the government changed in
2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the federal government and the three
coalition parties, the Social Democrats,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Green Party, as well as the Free
Democrats, have actually implemented in
[SPEAKER_00]: their coalition agreement that they will
go for the legalization of cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a two-sentence statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in June 2022, there was an expert
hearing initiated by Bo Kartblena,
[SPEAKER_00]: the drug commissioner in Germany,
to see what are the positive and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: even negative impacts on the legalization
of cannabis recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has happened since then is,
in October 2022, the federal minister of
[SPEAKER_00]: health, Dr. Lauterbach, actually presented
a key point paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody got very excited about that
because it actually had the framework of a
[SPEAKER_00]: total legalization program for adults of
recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contained very detailed provisions
regarding the cultivation, the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution, and even the control of the
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything under government control,
meaning cultivation under government
[SPEAKER_00]: control, the distribution through license
dispensaries, and as well, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as possible, the use of cannabis by
adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody was very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here again, there was also a but.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that there are legal hurdles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discussed that actually a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually pointing it out,
that we have the various UN conventions,
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular the 96th to 61 convention,
but what is even more important is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the Schengen agreement itself stipulates
very clearly the prohibition of all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of drugs, including cannabis, for
recreational purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Schengen agreement is the basis
for the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there are protocols
following the Schengen agreement,
[SPEAKER_00]: which reiterated that the legalization of
cannabis for recreational purposes is
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though in 2022, the government,
the German government, turned around 180
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They clearly stated and argued that the
prohibition of recreational cannabis did
[SPEAKER_00]: not fit the purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an increasing illicit market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giving you some ballpark figures here,
the current medicinal market is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: region of 20 to 25 metric tons a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The illicit market is around 400,
even maybe 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: metric tons a year and increasing in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives you a little bit of an
outline of what we are talking about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government actually took that position
paper, plus the arguments for the
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization of cannabis, which was very
similar as the Canadian have used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, further protection of the use,
protection of the consumer in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase by increasing the quality of the
respective product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, attacking the illicit
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government went to the European
Commission in October 2022 with this
[SPEAKER_00]: position paper and in an informal process
asked the European Commission,
[SPEAKER_00]: can we do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the Germany and the German
government was afraid that the European
[SPEAKER_00]: Commission and even any of the member
states would initiate a legal proceeding
[SPEAKER_00]: for the prohibition breach of the Schengen
agreement before the European Court of
[SPEAKER_00]: Justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those who are familiar with politics
and Germany and the European Court of
[SPEAKER_00]: Justice know that we have lost just
recently big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Germany has lost recently very big
time before the European Court of Justice
[SPEAKER_00]: for their data protection policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they wanted to avoid another judgment
of the European Court of Justice and have
[SPEAKER_00]: asked the commission, so can we do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what happened is, and nobody said it
that clearly, but I going to say clearly,
[SPEAKER_00]: they said, no, you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government was talking about
productive talks, which they had with the
[SPEAKER_00]: European Commission, but they were not
that productive to say at least,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they did not allow that we are
going to implement this law, which we had
[SPEAKER_00]: actually envisaged back in October 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what has happened, Plan B?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan B was taken out of the box,
and Plan B was presented in April this
[SPEAKER_00]: year with a two-pillar model, which I will
explain in a little bit more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this two-pillar model is, of course,
compared to the approach of October 22,
[SPEAKER_00]: a real setback, to say at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, from our point of view,
disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the industry, it is disappointing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what has now come into the discussion,
what is now stipulated in this new
[SPEAKER_00]: two-pillar approach is, I would say,
not that promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we will see that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concrete draft law was leaked in
May 2023, so just recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will have a look into that law a
little bit more in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the two-pillar model of this
official key point paper actually say?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of interesting,
because the German government looked into
[SPEAKER_00]: the box, what can we do with regard to the
legalization, and took everything what
[SPEAKER_00]: they could find, which was in the
framework, which they believe,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the European agreements and the UN
agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is this two-pillar model all
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the first pillar,
which is now under discussion,
[SPEAKER_00]: allows the individual self-cultivation of
three female plants per adult in a
[SPEAKER_00]: household.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, it is the community
self-cultivation allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have the possibility to establish
in a German fine structure, which you
[SPEAKER_00]: would say is kind of an association.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a cannabis club, as actually
promoted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cultivation association.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an association of up to 500 members
who can actually grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: self-cultivation by the club, by the
association, by this cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: association.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, then forwarded to or handed
over to its members for a fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is that this community
self-cultivation, this association,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a nonprofit organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been clearly stipulated in that
draft law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll come back to that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the licensing and the
monitoring of these clubs will be done by
[SPEAKER_00]: the respective state authorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pillar number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll come back to that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some more interesting facts
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second pillar is a regionally limited,
scientifically-monitored model project.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is possible under the UN conventions,
as we all know, for scientific purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is implemented already in
Switzerland, as we know, earlier this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Netherlands are going a similar
route, maybe not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will be actually implemented in a
second step.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first step is self-cultivation,
individual and community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second step is then the pilot
project, scientifically controlled pilot
[SPEAKER_00]: projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a duration of five years, and of
course, only adults with certain regional
[SPEAKER_00]: limitations can actually purchase them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will look into that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does the leaked draft law actually
say?
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking into that, there are various
articles which are kind of interesting to
[SPEAKER_00]: read.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a relatively long draft, to say at
least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are going to look into the more
important articles right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, of course, we are going
to create a new law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's typically German.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to have a law which is going
to create a new law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just called the
Cannabis-Abgabe-Gesetz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which regulates, actually, in which way
the cannabis association, these
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation associations, can actually
distribute cannabis to their members.
[SPEAKER_00]: How they are established, how they can
grow, and of course, also the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: control of the respective cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Article two, and I think that's important,
is a change of the German Narcotics Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the even more severe
changes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the THC-related products,
and THC will be taken out of the German
[SPEAKER_00]: Narcotics Act, and of course, transferred
to the new Cannabis Dissensory Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some changes, but that means,
actually, that cannabis products will not
[SPEAKER_00]: be any more narcotics, which has
significant impact, and I will come back
[SPEAKER_00]: to that later, also on the medical market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, then we're having a look
into the others, laws which need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: amended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, also the amendment to the
Road Traffic Act, an important issue which
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes is really neglected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's have a look into a little bit
more detail into this law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I said, up to three female plants
can be actually grown by each adult
[SPEAKER_00]: individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the household, and of course,
combined with an obligation to prevent the
[SPEAKER_00]: access to minors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, the respective non-commercial
cultivation in the associations can have
[SPEAKER_00]: up to 500 members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's interesting to see here as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a limitation planned for each
member over 21, which they can obtain up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 50 grams per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: The adults between 18 to 21 years old can
only purchase or get actually cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers of 30 grams per month with a THC
content of 10% or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe somebody can educate me how that is
going to be controlled, because that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant which we know has different
specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we can, to a certain extent,
have that limitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question is, how is then that be
cultivated?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have here a cultivation for adults
above 21, and here we have cultivation for
[SPEAKER_00]: the adults between 18 to 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I believe that this is relatively
difficult to establish, in particular on a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-profit basis, whereby the actually
draft law that's still a draft law says
[SPEAKER_00]: that these cultivation associations have
to finance themselves through the
[SPEAKER_00]: membership fees and not from the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a strict advertising ban,
of course, and the cannabis associations,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivation associations, have a very
strict monitoring and documentation
[SPEAKER_00]: obligation towards the authorities,
which will be randomly checked at least
[SPEAKER_00]: once a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: What comes along with that is the
decriminalization of possession of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in a large amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are talking about 30 grams,
25 grams, 30 grams, which an individual
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually carry without being punished.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain rules, and now we come
to the more practical side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: consummation, which means, first of all,
we have exclusion zones around areas where
[SPEAKER_00]: children are usually present, neighbors,
cannabis should not be disturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In pedestrian areas, the consumption of
cannabis is prohibited between 8 AM in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning till 8 PM in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly what the draft law says.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be the introduction of new
criminal provisions in case of a
[SPEAKER_00]: violation, which will be less strict than
we have it in the narcotics act.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see, from a practical point of
view, we have a number of issues which
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be adhered to, and maybe that is
not what you expected, but that's exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what the draft law currently says,
which is still under discussion in the
[SPEAKER_00]: respective ministries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amendment to the narcotics act,
I think, is an important issue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what the removal, of course,
of cannabis here of the respective act has
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain impact, of course, on the
medical market as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not be longer a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So physicians will not, and we'll see that
later, not be now prescribing a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to reduce to a certain
extent their reluctancy to prescribe
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for the specific patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The narcotics prescriptions are red.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time physicians is using that,
there's a certain barrier, at least
[SPEAKER_00]: psychologically, should I or should I not
actually prescribe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that in the medical market,
there's a certain reluctancy of physicians
[SPEAKER_00]: to widely prescribe cannabis for medical
purposes, which an obstacle which I think
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry needs to overcome with
further education of physicians and,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, more information about the use
of cannabis for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result, the BTMG will not be
longer applicable to cannabis-related
[SPEAKER_00]: offenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will have that now transferred to the
new Cannabis Act, as I said, with leveling
[SPEAKER_00]: down the punishment for the possession and
any kind of violations with regard to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to do right now is
look into a little bit more in detail into
[SPEAKER_00]: that act here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the amendment of the Road Traffic
Act, which is sometimes neglected in the
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions, but it is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's addressed in the law as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see what actually the changes will
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, with regard to alcohol,
a very clear, strict threshold and a limit
[SPEAKER_00]: for the consumption of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not yet established for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you legalize cannabis, this is an
issue which, of course, also the
[SPEAKER_00]: respective police actually, the traffic
police brought up and said, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: what can we do in order to find certain
kind of thresholds here in the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis which has been used by the
respective driver?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is he fit for driving or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is going to judge it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because different from alcohol,
you can still have a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in your blood, but you're still
100% fit for driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will be an interesting discussion,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how that is going to work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are currently discussing in which
way, one, that's how can we test that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, what will be the limits in the
future?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look into that draft law,
it is not as interesting or not as
[SPEAKER_00]: promising as we all expected, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look into the leaked draft law,
the various provisions are, from our point
[SPEAKER_00]: of view, much behind what we have seen in
2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the question is, of course,
how can we react to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the overall possibility in the
future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think what is important to say is
that we have the possibility to open at
[SPEAKER_00]: least the use of cannabis for recreational
purposes by adults, which is positive,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you look into the respective
THC limits, which I just addressed for the
[SPEAKER_00]: use, of cannabis in the social clubs,
I don't see that the argument of the
[SPEAKER_00]: government of last year to protect the use
and further increase the quality for the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of the respective product is going to
be met by the first pillar here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state authorities are supposed to
carry out the random checks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not yet the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not have personnel, nor do they
have the respective financial
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities to really look into how
we're going to look into, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 different cultivation associations here
in Berlin, or let it be five, and just
[SPEAKER_00]: calculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Such association, if it has 500 members
and they are all above 21 and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: handing out 50 grams per month,
if I'm not mistaken, they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate, they should cultivate 300
kilograms per year, one club.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you have to find a space in Berlin,
take into consideration that you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay away from schools, from kindergartens
and other areas which are prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can point out a place in Berlin
where we can actually cultivate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of our clients have done that,
and frankly speaking, there are not many
[SPEAKER_00]: places in Berlin where you really could do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have a concentration of schools
and kindergartens and sports arena where
[SPEAKER_00]: you should not grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: How should it be grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor growth for recreational cannabis is
not actually already defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law speaks about greenhouses,
at least, secured greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't say, hey, what is the
quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it GMP?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it GACP?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it below that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what is the quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: This will probably be more defined in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the security.
[SPEAKER_00]: How should the greenhouses be secured?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know that the three licensees
for cultivating medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany had to fulfill significant
security measurements in order to really
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate cannabis here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: The security measurements are really to a
certain extent, of course, very expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: to establish.
[SPEAKER_00]: But will they be applicable also to the
cultivation of recreational cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really yet defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are lots of questions,
lots of issues which the law leaves open,
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular on the practical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're going to see here is indeed
changing changes, which in comparison to
[SPEAKER_00]: the 2022 approach is really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key point paper of April this year is
significantly behind the October 2022
[SPEAKER_00]: paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The situation under international European
law was clear from the outset.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the German government presented that
plan transparently in order maybe to get
[SPEAKER_00]: an exception, a kind of allowance,
a nodding from the European Commission,
[SPEAKER_00]: which unfortunately the commission did not
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was therefore consistent with its
further policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have countries in Germany which
are very much supporting the German
[SPEAKER_00]: approach of October 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Czech Republic actually is very much
supporting our approach and also has
[SPEAKER_00]: announced that it could be possible that
they would legalize and have been drawn
[SPEAKER_00]: before the European Court of Justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would fight it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that is what some sources say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see whether this is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from our point of view, full
legalization will only be possible after
[SPEAKER_00]: the change of the European law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not be possible by any kind for
the European countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will not be possible to do that in a
different way, which is a long process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a look into the time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can be actually expected?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first pillar actually is now
under discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a draft law which is going to
describe very clearly what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: respects and objectives, next steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, of course,
will there be an implementation of the law
[SPEAKER_00]: before the year end?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's why I said here that's the
time frame according to our Ministry of
[SPEAKER_00]: Health, Mr. Lauterbach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been so far a little bit more
pessimistic about the time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: The law is yet under discussion between
the various ministries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It then has to go actually to the cabinet.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the cabinet, it will be presented to
the parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we will see whether
this can and will be implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it be before the year end?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my doubts on that, to be very
frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the first pillar, it may be
beginning of 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be surprised, because take into
consideration the political discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: which we will have about that law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have already heard from the more
conservatively governed states in Germany
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are not in favor of that law,
that they will need to have the discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: within the parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, can it be then really
possible to release that new law without
[SPEAKER_00]: the second chamber, the so-called
Bundesrat?
[SPEAKER_00]: All laws or new laws in Germany,
which have an impact on the various
[SPEAKER_00]: states, and the question is how big that
impact should be, need to be confirmed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the Bundesrat within the second chamber,
which consists of the member states,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the states in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have currently conservatively
majority in the Bundesrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see some obstacles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see what is possible if this law
will come into the parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the conservatively governed
states will definitely oppose any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: approach which Lauterbach and Özdemir,
when they presented this new law and the
[SPEAKER_00]: position paper in April, say we don't need
the Bundesrat for this law.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can argue that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see what the discussion will
bring out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that will be the case, the whole
process will be further prolonged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will probably see that not
happening before mid of 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see what the outcome will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not believe that the yet discussed
draft law will be in the cabinet before
[SPEAKER_00]: the summer break, which is starting in 14
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be probably after the summer
break in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the whole process
will start, which means beginning of 2024
[SPEAKER_00]: is more realistic than anything in 2023,
for the first pillar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second pillar, actually, the law will
be released after the summer break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why this has been not done together with
the first pillar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite solution, in case the European
Commission would not have approved the
[SPEAKER_00]: first approach, was the second pillar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do scientific control projects,
roll it out over Germany, and have it
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to Switzerland in order
to really have an access for the adults to
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that has not happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the timeline here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the potential impact of the
legalization here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's have a look at that chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers are not from me, to say at
least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an exemplary calculation of
Professor Haukab of the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Dusseldorf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have compared the fiscal impact of
the two pillar model in comparison to the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential full legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see, well, we don't have a
cannabis tax on the first pillar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all those who are going to export
cannabis products, into Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first pillar is anyway not
interesting, because it's self-cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: at home or in these respective cannabis
clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second pillar we'll see,
the government still said, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: we prefer domestic cultivation,
even for the second pillar, compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: imports from outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether this will still be the case,
take into consideration the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity which may be needed to fulfill
the needs of those who may qualify for the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific pilot projects is a different
question and not yet solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Income tax, well, it's one-tenth of what
we have actually as a potential full
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation income.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social security, but if you compare that
altogether here, and very questionable,
[SPEAKER_00]: the police expenses and the legal expenses
here, I believe they are probably not
[SPEAKER_00]: really saving we have a total of 1.1
billion euros for the two pillar model and
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.7 billion of income in the full
legalization process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously that was not a major argument
for the legislator right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the potential impact on the
medical market?
[SPEAKER_00]: We discussed that actually two days ago at
the Investors Forum, and it was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to see also the approach of
the industry on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to share that to a certain
extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what is definitely happening is
that with the reduction of the exclusion
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis from the Narcotics Act,
we have an increase of prescriptions
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, on the other hand, we know that we
have a large number of self-payers
[SPEAKER_00]: currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whether you're familiar with
that health care system in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a so-called statutory health
insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has to be insured, health
insured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these statutory health insurances are
going to reimburse the patients also for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is an approval, which is kind of
an exception, because other products,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't need a prior approval in order
to be reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: The patient is going to his doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The doctor says, yes, I would like to use
cannabis for the treatment of your
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a statutory health insured patient
has to file an application to the health
[SPEAKER_00]: insurance together with his doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be approved or not approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 60, 65% of the cases, we have an
approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, actually, the doctor can
prescribe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patient takes the prescription to the
pharmacy, and the pharmacy is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: reimbursed by the respective health
insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is what is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, of course, a number of patients
who do not want to go through that burden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not want to apply to the statutory
health insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are self-payers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just pay it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to the pharmacy and are not going
to be reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How large that group is is difficult to
judge because they don't appear in any
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of statistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a belief that we have around 40%,
maybe 50%, maybe even 60% of self-payers
[SPEAKER_00]: of the whole market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are they moving over to the
recreational market, yes or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a question, which I think is still
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can have a look into what has
happened in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see here, the impact in
Canada was, to a certain extent,
[SPEAKER_00]: more significant than what we actually
expect here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important to say
because Canada doesn't have any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: statutory health insurance as we have it
here in Germany, with the consequence
[SPEAKER_00]: that, of course, those who are going to be
reimbursed rather would stay with the
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be reimbursed, then move over to be
self-payers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the development actually, from my
point of view, is difficult to be
[SPEAKER_00]: transferred to the German situation
because of the health insurance system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we have some fixed figures from
Barmer, which is one of the statutory
[SPEAKER_00]: health insurers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say at Barmer, 79% of the patient
applications for medical cannabis were
[SPEAKER_00]: approved in 2021, which is a great number.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average, as I said, is somewhere in
the region between 60 to 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: And further applications, by the way,
are not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to apply every time you're
going to be reimbursed or be getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's reasonable to assume that the
patient pool will stay relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent, at least those who are going
to be reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the further impact here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's interesting to see as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important factor is the question
of how do we going to define the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of medical and of recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something which is not yet
defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the production facility look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the price structures,
of course, also of the medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison to the recreational cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the recreational cannabis,
as I said in the first pillar,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whether this is really
economically feasible of a club of 500
[SPEAKER_00]: members on a non-profit basis to really
grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There need to be solutions, from my point
of view, to work together even to have
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis clubs and cannabis associations,
cultivation associations combined in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow cannabis and not leave it to the
500 members to grow it somewhere in the
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard of the respective association.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada, actually, the legalization has
led to supply of shortages for patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: as many producers turned against medical
cannabis in favor for the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether this is applicable in Germany is
also a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the point is despite pillar one,
for pillar two, where do we get the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis from?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have three licensed producers who can,
to a certain extent, ramp up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Konstantin von der Gröben from Demekon
said we can do 20 tons a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, you know these licensed
cannabis producers in Germany are allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce 10.4 tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In four years, which is 2.6 tons in a year
by three licensees, plus 10% in addition,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is only a fraction of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know how the future will look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not seen any sign from the Bay
Farm whether they're going to tender out
[SPEAKER_00]: for medical cannabis cultivation for the
next four years because only for a four
[SPEAKER_00]: year contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's also a question, whether the
three licensees could actually supply that
[SPEAKER_00]: second pillar market.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my point of view, if you really roll
that out on a broadly basis, not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they start building new
facilities, which take some time as we all
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I rather see if we really have a
demand of recreational cannabis for that
[SPEAKER_00]: second pillar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really see the possibility for exporters
here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what extent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government still says we would like to
have domestic supply also for the second
[SPEAKER_00]: pillar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that be practical?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my doubts on that to say at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look into what has happened so
far and what we can expect here,
[SPEAKER_00]: the overall or the key point papers,
as I said, is a little bit behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Various EU members are actually going to
try to influence the respective
[SPEAKER_00]: developments in the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what is important, and I would
really like to cite that because that's so
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting, is from the key point paper
of April 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, the federal government
is continuing its efforts to promote its
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches among its European partners,
including examining the extent to which it
[SPEAKER_00]: will be possible for a sufficient number
of EU member states to take the initiative
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to make the relevant EU legal
framework more flexible and develop it
[SPEAKER_00]: further in the medium term.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a positive statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is medium term?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about five years,
talking about six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we have another change in the
government in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the action, if I'm not mistaken,
is sometime next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be kind of a different
approach here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without changing the EU framework,
it will not be possible to really
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate, distribute, cannabis for
recreational purposes in Germany and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the German system, even if it's a first
step, and that's what I said at my
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, is a good step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will hear today in the various
discussions on the panel here what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: ideas of the implementation, how should it
be done, what is actually the trade-off of
[SPEAKER_00]: the current government in order to
implement the legalization of cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having said that, I'm going to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have a very positive way in the
front of us in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not as quick, it is not as intense
as we actually expected it back in October
[SPEAKER_00]: 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a good step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a long-lasting process which needs
support of all stakeholders in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, of not only the lawyers who are
doing the administrative work and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to do some lobbying, but of course of all
the associations we have about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: stakeholders of the industry in order to
really make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And will Germany make that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it will.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is only when.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter Holmberg.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have four or five minutes left.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone has any questions they want to
ask Peter, you can maybe raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can come down to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also microphones there and
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in the back, we'll start with
this guy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is N'tal Bartanski.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of the exhibitors here and I'm
based out of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So has anyone on your team specifically
looked at the market boom bust cycles that
[SPEAKER_01]: different independent markets in the
United States have gone through,
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly because of the correlation between
the black market and regulation and taxes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I saw the presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't seem like that's really a
sensitivity and I think that's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: paramount for you to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are sitting actually four rows below
my colleague Eric Burden, who is here
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's heading the US cannabis practice at
Dentons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are, of course, steadily contacting
each other and discussing what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: various developments in different states
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the measurements can be taken as
an example and can actually also be
[SPEAKER_00]: positively used for the discussion which
we have currently here in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And indeed, we had last the week before
last week a meeting with representatives
[SPEAKER_00]: from the ministries at our offices
together with the industry representatives
[SPEAKER_00]: and, of course, all of the associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have discussed the current draft.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a draft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether we see that in that form is still
questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I presented here is what this draft
says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it will be really in the cabinet
and through the parliament in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: form is still a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what we actually have proposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discussed that with the various members
of the ministries and they saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: difficulties which, in fact, in
particular, the first pillar will have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is also where do we get
the seeds from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any seed exporters here in the
room?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely interesting for you
because if you have seeds which are
[SPEAKER_00]: approved for import into Germany for the
cannabis clubs, that is definitely a step
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do those who do home-grow get
their seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they get them from the cannabis
clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they are not a member,
they have to go to a member.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this law says and it's not my
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to go to a member and then go to
the cannabis club and then actually get
[SPEAKER_00]: their seeds for growing the three female
plants at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what this law says.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is whether it will be
possible for home growers to really order
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from approved companies and with the
approved variety of seeds is an open
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an open discussion, but not in the
law yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the discussions which are
currently going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you very much for your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bo?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Bo Whitney from Whitney
Economics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm based out of Oregon, but we do global
forecasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the space, the data that I'm going to
present tomorrow at 1015 reflects a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're saying in terms of
requirements and ramps and impacts and all
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually have a forecast going out
to 2030 for Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my question is in terms of influencing
EU policy and in terms of making and
[SPEAKER_02]: accelerating reform, would it be possible
if multiple countries like Germany,
[SPEAKER_02]: Czech Republic and others team up and then
force the EU's hand?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, second question is,
where does Malta play into this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Malta is doing some good stuff on
the medical side, but they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily supporting the recreational
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But where does Malta play into all this as
well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to address that during my
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is actually the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those countries who are in favor of the
legalization of cannabis for recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes have to team up within the
European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Germany will, obviously, that's what
we have heard here as well, hopefully take
[SPEAKER_00]: the lead on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have different member states and
different sizes of member states.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look into France, for example,
we don't see much of a movement in that
[SPEAKER_00]: direction, the opposite of the case,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look into the Czech Republic,
they are supporting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain, Portugal may also be very
supportive on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denmark, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other countries,
which Hungary, for example, who are also
[SPEAKER_00]: members of the European Union,
may see that differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an uphill battle, to say at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are lots of obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more member states are joining
forces, the better is the possibility that
[SPEAKER_00]: the EU Commission is going to think things
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not you can't force them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malta is a very interesting development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be going too far to go into
details here with regard to their club
[SPEAKER_00]: system and the recreational side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I may say so, and I hope nobody is
here from Malta, it's a small member
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: With not that significant influence,
that's the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can learn from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what they have done and in which
way it has been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the time we have.
Let's hear it again.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
