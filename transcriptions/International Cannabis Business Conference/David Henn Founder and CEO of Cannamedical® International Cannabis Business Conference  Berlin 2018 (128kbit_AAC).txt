[SPEAKER_10]: He has an extensive background in
business, banking.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's the CEO and founder of Canna Medical,
[SPEAKER_10]: who imports the finest medical cannabis
into Germany.
[SPEAKER_10]: Please give it up for our next speaker,
Mr. David Hinn.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a big pleasure to be here today.
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is David Hinn.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the founder and CEO of Canna Medical.
[SPEAKER_11]: We are a pioneer in the European cannabis
industry and we are the third company that
[SPEAKER_11]: got ever a license issued by German
authorities to legally import and
[SPEAKER_11]: distribute medical cannabis, which we do
with great success today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Canna Medical Pharma will be the first
company ever being able in Germany to
[SPEAKER_11]: guarantee supply to German patients and to
match the demand up on May 2018.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can do so because we found very strong
new partners around the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were searching for the highest medical
cannabis standards we could find.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were very pleased to announce two weeks
ago that we are cooperating with a
[SPEAKER_11]: Canada-based company, Mad Relief,
that holds multiple prices for the quality
[SPEAKER_11]: of their cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_11]: So most of you came here today because you
are investors, you are LPs around the
[SPEAKER_11]: world, you are very interested into
Germany easily because it's the biggest
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis market in the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: Per today, one year after the cannabis law
was established in Germany, we are facing
[SPEAKER_11]: a demand of 15 tons a year today.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do this with 60,000 patients that are
splitted within the two-peer health
[SPEAKER_11]: insurance system, which equals the private
insured people, which are represented by
[SPEAKER_11]: 20,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have 10,000 patients that are public
insured that enjoy the full coverage of
[SPEAKER_11]: health insurance for their medical
cannabis medication.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have another very big third group
that is very often missing.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the private payer group.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they don't do the way through the
health insurance companies.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't apply for the cost coverage.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just paid for themselves.
[SPEAKER_11]: And besides, Germany is even the highest
price market in the world, which is a
[SPEAKER_11]: problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we do see solutions coming quite soon.
[SPEAKER_11]: For those of you who don't know,
a price of medical cannabis today in a
[SPEAKER_11]: pharmacy equals around 20 to 25 euros per
gram, which is a lot compared to what
[SPEAKER_11]: actually is charged in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: What is also a very interesting number for
the investors that are participating in
[SPEAKER_11]: this speech.
[SPEAKER_11]: The German cannabis market, according to
Forbes, equals up to 18 billion euros in
[SPEAKER_11]: revenues over the next three years.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a massive number.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just heard the number two days ago that
actually during the last two years,
[SPEAKER_11]: Canadian LPs were getting investments over
the last year of $1.25 billion in
[SPEAKER_11]: investments.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the number of LPs in Canada is growing
every single day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Health Canada just improved, increased
their staff by 300%, which is quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are positive that over the next
time, we will have sufficient supply to
[SPEAKER_11]: also serve other European Union countries
that are opening up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm convinced that most of you are very
interested in regarding one question,
[SPEAKER_11]: how do I import into Germany?
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we hear a lot of rumors around the
world.
[SPEAKER_11]: We meet up with a lot of people and we
speak with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_11]: So actually what is required is to have a
German GMP or an equal GMP from a European
[SPEAKER_11]: authority.
[SPEAKER_11]: By today, we only have Germany that allows
the import.
[SPEAKER_11]: So pretty much Germany is your door opener
into Europe.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have four companies on the market
and I'm very proud to tell you that Canon
[SPEAKER_11]: Medical is the only company that is acting
on a privately owned basis.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we did not sell ourselves to any
Canadian LP or any other LP in the world
[SPEAKER_11]: yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do so because we strongly believe that
the market is just at the very beginning
[SPEAKER_11]: stage.
[SPEAKER_11]: The huge potential and economical
potential is just at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we have a big market for flowers
today, I'd be 100% sure that it will
[SPEAKER_11]: change quite soon and we will also get
into more into oils, more into extracts,
[SPEAKER_11]: more into sprays, capsules, oils.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this also requires in Germany clinical
studies.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whenever I speak with Canadian companies
or other LPs around the world,
[SPEAKER_11]: they always ask me one question.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I import flowers?
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I import creams?
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I import oils?
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, Germany is a bit different.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you would like to import oils to
Germany today, this will require a
[SPEAKER_11]: clinical study or the option two is we let
the pharmacy do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That means we are able to import oil as
bulk material.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one option.
[SPEAKER_11]: The other option is, as for example,
Tilray does it, that the pharmacy does the
[SPEAKER_11]: final mixing within their pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a very, very easier way to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But in fact, we are not able to import
finished oil products today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Same goes for capsules.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kana Medical itself is serving a growing
network of roughly about 2,000 pharmacies
[SPEAKER_11]: today.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do so through a very high skilled sales
team that is doing a fantastic job every
[SPEAKER_11]: day The German market mechanism,
for those of you who don't know it yet,
[SPEAKER_11]: is very simple.
[SPEAKER_11]: The patient goes to the doctor,
gets a prescription for medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_11]: goes to the pharmacy, the pharmacy orders
at one of the importers or distributors
[SPEAKER_11]: for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once we did so, we hope that we are able
quite soon to send out our deliveries
[SPEAKER_11]: within only 24 hours time.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the definite goal quite soon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Moreover, will Kana Medical invest over
the next two years up to 10 million euros
[SPEAKER_11]: into research and development,
which is a very, very big number for us.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do so with a strong belief that
actually the clinical studies will allow
[SPEAKER_11]: us to import more products, import a
broader range of products, and that we are
[SPEAKER_11]: able then to serve German patients better.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of you have seen recently Kana
Medical's patients ID cards.
[SPEAKER_11]: We established this ID card to give
patients for the first time in history the
[SPEAKER_11]: option to actually demonstrate whenever
they get into a police control that they
[SPEAKER_11]: are a legal cannabis patient.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a very, very big problem in
Germany when it comes to police controls
[SPEAKER_11]: because we get told a lot of stories that
police takes it away from our patients.
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't like this.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we would like to actually commit
ourselves and give a great support to
[SPEAKER_11]: those patients that this is no longer
happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: The patient ID card, Kana Medical offers
today is free of charge, meaning you can
[SPEAKER_11]: just order it at your pharmacy and have
the opportunity to get it delivered within
[SPEAKER_11]: a two-day time zone.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's it from my side.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very happy to answer any kind of
questions that are coming up from your
[SPEAKER_11]: side.
[SPEAKER_05]: Germans are so efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your 30-minute speeches take 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a question back here.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's Francesco here from Empress
Pharmaceuticals, Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, the question is, you really
think that in the next years, Germany and
[SPEAKER_08]: Europe, Italy, Spain won't be able to grow
up the cannabis we can say they need for
[SPEAKER_08]: their patient and they will still need the
import we can say the buds from Canada,
[SPEAKER_08]: from the U.S., from Uruguay, or the
Canadian companies are growing up in
[SPEAKER_08]: Portugal because, I mean, you mentioned as
well for the price that the retail price
[SPEAKER_08]: is actually 25 euros a gram, which is
really unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a really huge price.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, because we both know how much a
gram of buds of weed, we can say,
[SPEAKER_08]: costs in the end of, we can say,
production, okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: We can consider as well the packaging.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can consider the logistic delivery and
everything you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: But actually, to reach 25 euros is a long
way.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with you in two points.
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, Germany, we're all aware of the
German tender that was fully messed up,
[SPEAKER_11]: but I agree with you that Europe will be
able to serve itself from inside Europe,
[SPEAKER_11]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I'm speaking about import,
it does not necessarily only mean that
[SPEAKER_11]: we're importing from Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: It means we're also continuously
evaluating opportunities.
[SPEAKER_11]: This includes Portugal and other European
Union countries that are just opening up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I fully agree with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: As well, another thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, you said that for import,
you need the GMP license, the ESO and
[SPEAKER_08]: everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, in Europe, if you have the GMP
license, you can absolutely grow up as
[SPEAKER_08]: well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, the same companies are buying
the stuff from you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, in the next years, will be able
to grow up themselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, actually, as well for the
pricing, I was mentioned before,
[SPEAKER_08]: there will be a lot of companies in the
business.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that I hope as well that the
price will get lower as well because it's
[SPEAKER_08]: not just business.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is medical.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just overpricing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got to be aware the price I
mentioned is the price the pharmacy
[SPEAKER_11]: charges to a health insurance company.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not the price kind of medical or any
other imported charges to a patient.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is way lower.
[SPEAKER_11]: As most of you know, the German pharmacies
add up to 100% of the price they are
[SPEAKER_11]: paying to a wholesaler.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have actually two questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first one is from which other
countries are you planning to import in
[SPEAKER_12]: the near future?
[SPEAKER_12]: How is the perspective on this area and
then the other question is, if I
[SPEAKER_12]: understood correctly, Germany is only
allow you only to import flowers,
[SPEAKER_12]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Today, yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe this has to do with the
regulation that will perhaps change and
[SPEAKER_12]: then you cannot say anything about when
and how will oil be imported or if it will
[SPEAKER_12]: be possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I wanted to know what do you know so
far about that, about importing further
[SPEAKER_12]: than the flowers and then if you can tell
me anything else about the clinical
[SPEAKER_12]: studies that are required.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I get you right, you asked four
questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: The first question is from which other
countries are we evaluating to import to
[SPEAKER_11]: Germany?
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are the big ones all of you are
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course we have an eye to Israel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, we are having a partner in
Canada already.
[SPEAKER_11]: Of course, we are speaking to people in
Portugal.
[SPEAKER_11]: We see a continuously growing network of
producers that are just coming up and it's
[SPEAKER_11]: the best thing that can happen to the
German patients because just on your side
[SPEAKER_11]: story, we are just delivering December
orders, which is way too long.
[SPEAKER_11]: The second thing you asked me is regarding
the oils and clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if you want to sell it, in Germany
as a fully finished medicine, it requires
[SPEAKER_11]: a clinical study.
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem with clinical studies is once
you do it, you only do it for one disease.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's say we start a clinical study to
show the mechanisms regarding depressions,
[SPEAKER_11]: then it's only valid for depressions.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do one for pain.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's only very precise and cost intensive
to do so for pain patients.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the third question, if I got you
right, can you repeat the third one?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to remember it right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're consulting the notes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_12]: The clinical studies, he already answered
that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they are very cost intensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're so efficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Hen, you referred to clinical studies
and I was just wondering what standard of
[SPEAKER_04]: clinical studies you refer to?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they European medicine agency?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they European food agency?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which clinical studies are you imagining
for the new finished oil products?
[SPEAKER_11]: We are just into a stage where those
clinical studies get designed.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we'll be able to tell you more
precisely about the way we will do them in
[SPEAKER_11]: the next six months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who sets the standards?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not your company.
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be a European agency, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: We're working with a company we know for
quite a while that does these clinical
[SPEAKER_11]: studies together with us.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have experience of 15 years in doing
so, even for the big pharma industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: We will register the first clinical study
within the next 90 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a private company.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a European agency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any product that you sell
currently that has European medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: agency approval for the clinical study
that it's done?
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, you will understand that we will
come up with the design of the clinical
[SPEAKER_11]: study and all the information I can give
you within the next 90 days and it will be
[SPEAKER_11]: a very big announcement and a very big
step for kind of medical or cost intensive
[SPEAKER_11]: stuff.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one added addition to the question
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are only talking about importation
inside the European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the Latin American market opening up
also for this possibility?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some relations to growers of
cannabis in Colombia, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a possibility to get those
products into Germany in the near future?
[SPEAKER_11]: Indeed, we get contact from a lot of
growers around the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we continuously evaluating
opportunities and see how realistic this
[SPEAKER_11]: opportunity is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Colombia is one of them and the problem we
have with Colombia today is a bit of
[SPEAKER_11]: uncertainty regarding if Colombia will
establish a cannabis agency regarding to
[SPEAKER_11]: the UN Convention of 1961.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we are positive that this will happen
on one way or another during the next
[SPEAKER_11]: month or years and Colombia will actually
become an opportunity for us, of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very attractive due to the pricing
structure and we are very happy and
[SPEAKER_11]: excited to test or do the start dialogue
with our local authorities to see if we
[SPEAKER_11]: will actually be able to import from
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is regarding product
development at Canna Medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: So first part would be are there any plans
to develop a private label brand?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then secondly, how do you decide which
strains to source and potencies of the
[SPEAKER_06]: strains?
[SPEAKER_11]: I can promise you today that we will have
a private label on the market on one way
[SPEAKER_11]: or another within the next 12 months.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just a logic of consequence.
[SPEAKER_11]: So today Canna Medical is based on the
importers and products on the market.
[SPEAKER_11]: We are the only company that is importing
on a medical label.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is definitely a goal on our list
and we follow this with great interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also I think she asked how do you
decide which strains to use?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a selection process?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does your homie just go, this is the dank?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I can promise you today is that
Canna Medical is even the only company
[SPEAKER_11]: that will be very transparent regarding
varieties, regarding turpent profiles.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that there are a few companies on
the market that make a big secret out of
[SPEAKER_11]: it, but we are not afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We will promise that the varieties will
not change for metal leaf products.
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be standardized, it will be always
the same.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you order in January, in March and
April, it will be very standardized.
[SPEAKER_11]: You will get full access to the turpent
profiles.
[SPEAKER_11]: You will get full access to any kind of
information you will need from Canna
[SPEAKER_11]: Medical.
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be great if you could share a
little bit in terms of how does the import
[SPEAKER_13]: actually work?
[SPEAKER_13]: Storage, security, safety and what sort of
regulations are in place there or a post
[SPEAKER_13]: of you from the government?
[SPEAKER_11]: So an import actually is a very difficult
thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: First you need security for transport.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just give you an example.
[SPEAKER_11]: We also had insurance sales against
missile attacks.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a very out of reach thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Missile attack?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, so we have this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Still you need to ensure that your
cannabis is, for example, temperature
[SPEAKER_11]: controlled all over the way when it's on
the plane, meaning you need temperature
[SPEAKER_11]: tracking for 48 hours that they're working
independently so we can see that at no
[SPEAKER_11]: point on time the temperature tracking was
beyond or above a certain level that we
[SPEAKER_11]: defined.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then you have the security problem because
whenever we pick up a product from our
[SPEAKER_11]: Canadian partner, this is very,
very high security risk.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like this is cannabis worth multiple
million dollars.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's another factor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then of course it goes hand in hand with
lab testing.
[SPEAKER_11]: The German government would like to see
that the cannabis we import match it at
[SPEAKER_11]: any point on time, the German Cannabis
Monography, which for example is a very
[SPEAKER_11]: big problem when it comes to THC
specification.
[SPEAKER_11]: The German Cannabis Monography allows a
deviation of up to 10% plus minus from a
[SPEAKER_11]: registered THC level.
[SPEAKER_11]: If this is not fulfilled, I cannot import
it to Germany.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then of course we have stability studies
for packaging to show that actually the
[SPEAKER_11]: product is stable after six, nine,
or 12 months in its packaging.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very quite complex process we get
into and once the product here is in
[SPEAKER_11]: Germany, I can assure you we have a very
high security of 900 square meters that
[SPEAKER_11]: even includes full police control.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a fire brigade, direct cameras
into the vault and we are shipping
[SPEAKER_11]: products from there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very central in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why it costs $24 a gram.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what actually the pharmacy is
charging the health insurance company
[SPEAKER_11]: because they add up to 100%.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have one in Germany today.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very central in Germany located so we
are able to, as long as we have supply,
[SPEAKER_11]: to deliver any product within 24 hours
time zone.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: One question is on the licensing as it
sounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why there's only four people that
are probably importing.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other hand, it sounds like you've
solved all the problems so it's possible
[SPEAKER_03]: and of course probably you don't want to
come out with it because you'd like to
[SPEAKER_03]: stay on top being one of the only
importers because you're making profit of
[SPEAKER_03]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, first, we are not afraid of
competition, first of all.
[SPEAKER_11]: I see a lot of faces.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that certain of you are already
working on licenses and certain of you are
[SPEAKER_11]: already working on a very big opportunity.
[SPEAKER_11]: Canon Medical has solved this problem as a
very early stage import and distributor.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the biggest, and I get this
question quite often, because how is it
[SPEAKER_11]: possible that only four companies serve
the market today?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more cost-intensive as you believe.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's more regulated than you believe.
[SPEAKER_11]: And just very honest, I believe some of
them just give up in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_11]: process because it's just killing their
capacities.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, I'm pretty sure more will join us
and this is good this way.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not afraid of competition.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're very excited to start a good
dialogue with those of you that make it to
[SPEAKER_11]: get a license.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we will see where this ends up,
but there will be new companies on the
[SPEAKER_11]: market, I'm very sure, at some point in
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And probably we can talk to you as well
during the seminar or tonight at the party
[SPEAKER_03]: where you will be and you will probably
help us on some more questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next question is, you're not doing
any CBD products, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's correct.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just THC?
[SPEAKER_11]: Just THC for a very simple reason.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were discussing, like I have this
discussion once a week with our sales team
[SPEAKER_11]: that is asking me at what point in time we
will start doing CBD products.
[SPEAKER_11]: The thing is, I will not start a
competition with an Amazon trailer or
[SPEAKER_11]: wholesaler, very easy, because it doesn't
have a pharmaceutical quality.
[SPEAKER_11]: Kana Medical is in an ongoing process to
do a lot of digillings on CBD producers,
[SPEAKER_11]: but without being disrespectful to
anybody, so far none of them has ever
[SPEAKER_11]: matched Kana Medical's quality standards.
[SPEAKER_11]: So at the point in time, we will find one
that actually successfully finalizes our
[SPEAKER_11]: digillings on them, I will also do CBD
products, yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: But they need to be pharmaceutical
quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and the last one is, I hear that
you're interested very much in doing this
[SPEAKER_03]: and making this business work for the
consumer and the patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other, because it's been in the
papers, you're one of the first ones and
[SPEAKER_03]: you made a bunch of profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: This year already, and if you've been in
the papers, any other goodness from you to
[SPEAKER_03]: go back to Henry Rollins, except just the
patient's idea that your company is
[SPEAKER_03]: putting into social projects or anything
else?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are working very close with the city
of Cologne, where Cologne is a company,
[SPEAKER_11]: so we have certain social projects
ongoing.
[SPEAKER_11]: With the drug support on a local basis,
this is a very big topic for us.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were just contacted by another group
that we are supporting now.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a social school for liable
handicapped kids, which is a very big
[SPEAKER_11]: problem because we have a so-called
non-kids policy, because I strongly
[SPEAKER_11]: believe that THC products and kits,
in certain cases, is a good decision,
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's very tricky and very difficult.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, we are, you just asked about other
projects we have besides the patient ID
[SPEAKER_11]: card.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a few in the pipeline and we
will hear them very soon.
[SPEAKER_11]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_09]: You spoke about how difficult it is to
import cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just wondering about the length of the
process.
[SPEAKER_09]: So how long does it take to get a license?
[SPEAKER_09]: How long does it take if you apply to
increase your cannabis supply from the
[SPEAKER_09]: point the application is made until it's
approved?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'm also interested if you could
tell me what happens when there's a supply
[SPEAKER_09]: shortage.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does the pharmacist contact the importer?
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could just tell me a bit about this
process, please.
[SPEAKER_11]: So these are two questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: So first to answer is the whole process
for importing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very complex process because it
requires, in any case, to have a GMP
[SPEAKER_11]: certification.
[SPEAKER_11]: If this is a foreign company, German
companies don't produce yet.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can tell that we were working for the
last seven months very strong together
[SPEAKER_11]: with our Canadian partner Med Relief to
help them getting the GMP.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know what I'm speaking about.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have them getting it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been involved through the whole
process.
[SPEAKER_11]: I flew several times over with a big team.
[SPEAKER_11]: It worked successfully.
[SPEAKER_11]: So watch out for the news two weeks.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to get deeper into it.
[SPEAKER_11]: To set up the process itself regarding a
transport, logistic transport,
[SPEAKER_11]: this is not the big thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just define actually shipping waste,
transport waste with any other import and
[SPEAKER_11]: export company as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: The second question you had is how do we
treat pharmacies whenever we have shortage
[SPEAKER_11]: on the market?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I cannot deliver them, they keep
ordering.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a waiting list.
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, this will change from May 2018
on because by this time, we will be able
[SPEAKER_11]: to guarantee to our pharmacies that we can
actually serve every patient in Germany
[SPEAKER_11]: with medical cannabis because we have
very, very good contracts.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a very good relation build up with
our supplier network that guaranteed
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis medical to have shipments at
least every 28 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Mr. Hen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple of quick questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, and if I heard you correctly,
that you're delivering product orders from
[SPEAKER_00]: December, that the waiting list was that
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I heard correctly,
so maybe you can clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my question is about your relationship
with Med Relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it an exclusive relationship or are you
also able to work with other suppliers
[SPEAKER_00]: from Canada?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you interested in bringing some of
the other products, like their gel caps or
[SPEAKER_00]: the cream?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: So my relationship with Med Relief,
this is a very, very long-term good
[SPEAKER_11]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we import Med Relief on an exclusive
basis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nevertheless, as long as Med Relief can
deliver the amount we request them six
[SPEAKER_11]: months in before, I promise that we will
always match the demand.
[SPEAKER_11]: But still, I'm free to choose any other
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if one of you wants to come up with
suggestions, we're very happy to receive
[SPEAKER_11]: them at any point in time.
Hello.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next question back here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I cannot hear you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll come back to him in a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: I already ran over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll come back.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the question is all around oils.
[SPEAKER_11]: We are delivering currently December
products.
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, this will all change in May.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my question is all around oils.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the first is a point of clarification,
and then the second is a question.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think you answered this woman's
question here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you said that at present, you can only
import flour into Germany.
[SPEAKER_07]: But previously, you had said that Tilray
is actually importing oils into Germany.
[SPEAKER_07]: So can you clarify that?
[SPEAKER_11]: I said that it's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have two oil products on the market
today.
[SPEAKER_11]: One is from Bionorica.
[SPEAKER_11]: They produce it locally within Germany
with material from Austria.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we have the Tilray oils that are
imported from Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think what I didn't highlight when
saying sorry for the confusion.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are able to import oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have a regulation in Germany that
requires the pharmacy to do the final step
[SPEAKER_11]: before the patient will be able to receive
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The process, therefore, is different.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a receptional pharmaceutical
medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the big difference.
[SPEAKER_11]: The classification matters.
[SPEAKER_11]: You are not able to send into Germany a
finalized oil bottle, let's say,
[SPEAKER_11]: of 10 milliliters and get the doctor
prescribe it for depressions or for a pain
[SPEAKER_11]: bake or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: So from what we know is that the pharmacy
receives extracts, for example,
[SPEAKER_11]: from Bionorica.
[SPEAKER_11]: They add up certain oils.
[SPEAKER_11]: And for Tilray, they bring up bigger
bottles classified as bulk material.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there is no way you can actually trade
it the same way as an aspirin,
[SPEAKER_11]: for example, today.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my second question still around
oils is, it's my understanding that there
[SPEAKER_07]: are different types of oils that you can
then extract.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are different levels of extraction.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you could just ship over a raw oil or a
winterized oil or the distillates,
[SPEAKER_07]: for example.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any rules or regulations or any
sort of themes that you're seeing in terms
[SPEAKER_07]: of which types of oils are being imported
as a raw material?
[SPEAKER_11]: To my knowledge today, they are not
limited.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I would like to get back to you with
this question.
[SPEAKER_11]: We could just have a quick conversation
afterwards this speech.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to answer this question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure you'll be able to have more
talking in the hallway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: As people want to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There he is over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you so far away?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've already reached my step limit on my
Fitbit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm coming.
I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_15]: My question is around, you said you're
importing flowers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you also said these are pharmaceutical
grade.
[SPEAKER_15]: So how do you reconcile that with the
variability you have with flowers?
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you mind repeating the question?
[SPEAKER_15]: You said that you are importing flowers.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that these were pharmaceutical grade
because you're making pharmaceutical grade
[SPEAKER_15]: products.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you controlling the variability
that's inevitable?
[SPEAKER_11]: I can promise you that not only us are
ongoing controlling the quality,
[SPEAKER_11]: but also the German authorities.
[SPEAKER_11]: Meaning we do have a very complex testing
method set up.
[SPEAKER_11]: So every import comes with an individual
release certificate that allows you to
[SPEAKER_11]: track every THC level, CBD level,
absence of having metals, absence of
[SPEAKER_11]: contamination, any kind, mold.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a very, very broad testing that comes
up with every single import we do.
[SPEAKER_11]: But also, beyond the governmental
restrictions, we have established a kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of medical quality code.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the product we import does also have to
match the kind of medical quality code.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is, for example, has lower limits
for the THC variety than the government
[SPEAKER_11]: allows us.
[SPEAKER_11]: So kind of medical is very ambition to
import very standardized cannabis that
[SPEAKER_11]: always have the same quality under the
same level of THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_14]: One question is regarding your contract
with a bee farm.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have annual amounts that you're
allowed to import to Germany.
[SPEAKER_14]: Already somebody asked you, can you
increase those amounts?
[SPEAKER_14]: And then how long are you guaranteed to be
able to import that amount?
[SPEAKER_14]: For a year indefinitely?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a time limit?
[SPEAKER_11]: To my knowledge, this is an unlimited time
frame.
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, I'm very happy to tell you that
also, to my knowledge, Cannamatic is the
[SPEAKER_11]: company with the highest quantities that
are permitted on the market today.
[SPEAKER_11]: To do so, we went through a very complex
validation with the bee farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had to prove them in several.
[SPEAKER_11]: We had to get them very deep into our
contracts to prove that we are actually
[SPEAKER_11]: able to deliver those amounts.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's not so easy for a country to,
every time, increase the amounts a country
[SPEAKER_11]: is allowed to import.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because whenever, let's say, I request
more 20 tons at the bee farm, and they are
[SPEAKER_11]: deliverable, it requires the bee farm to
go back to the UN health council based in
[SPEAKER_11]: Vienna to raise the overall quantity for
Germany.
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is you that is mentioned in the
Kleine Anfrage from the Linke that require
[SPEAKER_14]: it to import 10 tons in the future?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me put it that way.
[SPEAKER_11]: I promise that we will be able to match
the demand from May on.
OK.
[SPEAKER_14]: My last question.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whatever the demand might be.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you repackage in Germany?
No.
[SPEAKER_14]: You get the final product packaged from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: One last quick one, and then we're going
to move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for your interesting talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a follow-up question on your
quality control thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the earlier question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it fair to assume that you're
getting external audits from FDA,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it all internal control?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you explained your control process
on the quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you get external audits on this?
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have external audits.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're working ongoing with external
qualified control consultants.
[SPEAKER_11]: But not because we're forced so,
but just easily because we want to be the
[SPEAKER_11]: best company on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it again for David Hinn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
Thank you.
