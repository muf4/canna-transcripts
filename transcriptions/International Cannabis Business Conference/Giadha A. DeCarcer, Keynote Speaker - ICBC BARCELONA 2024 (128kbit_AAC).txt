[SPEAKER_02]: Right here on the front row, big support,
you know, Colombian Weed Expo,
[SPEAKER_02]: Medellin Expo, Henry right here,
big support of the ICBC right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate you, Henry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got my new gopcho hat now,
so we're ready to rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name's Alex Rogers, I'm the CEO and I'm
the founder of the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our fifth edition in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started our first edition with 218.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made a beautiful partnership with
Spanibus and we decided to rock and roll
[SPEAKER_02]: and bring B2B to Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to thank the Tallman Group
for sponsoring, being the head sponsor of
[SPEAKER_02]: the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go see them, check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a booth here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a big party with DJ Mugs tonight at
9 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to say that, you know,
I heard some coffee shops got raided last
[SPEAKER_02]: night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did anyone hear that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That some coffee shops got raided.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's so ironic, here we are and
it feels like weed is legal, but I always
[SPEAKER_02]: say that the battle's just begun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even when we make progress with policy,
that's really when the work just begins,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the devil's in the details,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they say implementation is 90% of
the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's incumbent upon us to educate
and push it out there in a dishearable
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we all live in the institution,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all have to stay strong and stand
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in some ways, I think I'm preaching
to the choir because I think that's most
[SPEAKER_02]: of all of you right now, right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not complacent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We stand up for what we believe in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not just cannabis, that's human
rights and treating each other with
[SPEAKER_02]: respect and dignity all the time,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because unless you're a total asshole,
then you can fuck up, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have to have tolerance for people
and things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to understand that it's a
magical miracle that we're all here
[SPEAKER_02]: together and share this beautiful life on
this planet for this brief time that we
[SPEAKER_02]: get here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel very blessed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And can you please give you all a round of
applause?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to, let's get it going,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get it going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to introduce first the MC of the
ICBC for the last 10 years, my main man
[SPEAKER_02]: for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, please give a warm welcome to
the one and only Ungaro Bilal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again for Alex Rogers and the whole
ICBC team.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put this whole thing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bienvenidos a Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're really going to enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a great group of panelists and
speakers today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of quick announcements.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says in the program that the party
starts at eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: The party starts at nine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's still kind of early,
but you know, some of you are old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I include myself in that statement,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the party starts at nine o'clock at the
Addition Hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ Muggs is going to spin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be drinks and snacks and food and
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring your badge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, tickets for Berlin are on sale right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Berlin is crazy because their
legalization program is going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is the time to go to learn
about how to get involved, to learn what
[SPEAKER_01]: to do, to meet all the people who are
going to be involved in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't forget to get your tickets to
Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, like Alex mentioned,
we'd like to thank our title sponsor,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Tallman Group, because they are also
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how things get done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on in, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, let's just get it
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our keynote speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that knowledge is power,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: She knows a lot of things because she is
the founder of New Frontier Data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she can break down all the analytics
for you and all the different things that
[SPEAKER_01]: she's going to talk about, a bunch of
different things here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's also the principal at Blue Onyx
Horizons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like you to put your hands
together and welcome to the International
[SPEAKER_01]: Campus Business Conference, Giana
Descartes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking outside, and we were sort of
reminiscing about, wow, it's been 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had the privilege of attending
the ICBC for a decade now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it feels like a college reunion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't feel like work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, ICBC, for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very exciting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalize recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am here today to help draw some
parallels from what happened in the US
[SPEAKER_00]: after the first recreational legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we learn, the good, the bad,
and the ugly, the risks and the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities from the experience that we
can see from the United States and North
[SPEAKER_00]: America in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fun and games aside, we say that
history repeats itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doomed if we don't learn from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that it creates a great
opportunity for us here in Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: given that we have our peers in North
America that have truly had their first
[SPEAKER_00]: chance at making the mistakes,
learned the lessons, and that if we look
[SPEAKER_00]: back, we may be able to expedite and
maximize what we can truly do for the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've had the pleasure to see a lot
of friendly faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are also a lot of new faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came into the industry in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the US, I founded a company called New
Frontier Data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were the first to come in trying to
really look at raw data, draw analytics,
[SPEAKER_00]: and be able to predict where the risks and
the opportunities would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014 was an interesting year in North
America because in 2012, Colorado and
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington state were the first states to
legalize recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite that California was the first to
legalize in the 1990s, we really saw a
[SPEAKER_00]: shift in the marketplace, both from an
investment and a new business perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really in 2013 and 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had the privilege to sort of have
a front row seat at what happened and what
[SPEAKER_00]: was the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened since?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to first take sort of a look at
the globe and then bring it back to
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 100 nations around the world
that have either legalized or
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalized cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember saying that there were 18
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's over 100 nations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone a long way in just a decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's happened in this last decade,
we begin to see some regional trends with
[SPEAKER_00]: some specific specialization in each of
these regions when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, which is really unique
because the cannabis industry went from
[SPEAKER_00]: being an emerging market to a global
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So North America really sort of the
epicenter of consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of sort of plant touching innovation
and B2C sort of types of businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also North America continues to be the
largest consumer market in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mind you, Europe is expected to be the
second largest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have Latin America where we have
seen some serious deregulation and they
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to be positioning themselves as more
of a lower cost cultivation hub with an
[SPEAKER_00]: intent of really exporting to those
consumer markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Europe and North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia Pacific, very interesting region.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the cannabis industry,
really looking to focus in R&D,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it is from medical use or
industrial hemp applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing a lot of new IP in terms
of the graphing nation of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also seeing some very advanced
research in terms of the medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: applications of cannabis for things such
as cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa is very interesting as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: While there aren't as many nations that
have legalized or decriminalized,
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa has been an agri-based economy as a
whole, mostly dominated by tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the decrease in tobacco consumption
around the world, they have been looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for an opportunity to both diversify out
of tobacco, but also, I must admit,
[SPEAKER_00]: cut the bonds from Chinese sort of
financial dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I'm going to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're looking at hemp as an
opportunity to get out of that situation
[SPEAKER_00]: with the hope to also export low cost hemp
and cannabis to Europe with, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: some regulatory challenges they're still
trying to work through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe is the big question mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to figure out what's going to
happen in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe is really specially positioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe has had the opportunity to look and
learn from what's happened around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've taken their time, they've been
very wise as the old nation, to wait for
[SPEAKER_00]: the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe also has the benefit of a very
mature food and beverage and health and
[SPEAKER_00]: beauty industrial infrastructure,
whereby those advanced application of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for those sectors may be the true
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it is a processing hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a consumer goods export hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question mark remains, but the
opportunities are certainly material.
[SPEAKER_00]: How material are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: The global cannabis industry today is at
over 300 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a conservative number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mind you, you're going to see a lot of
numbers from a variety of data and
[SPEAKER_00]: analytics experts, which I'm very happy to
see that since new front data was born,
[SPEAKER_00]: now there are many looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we all agree on is that it's huge
and that it's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, look at Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe, it's almost a $70 billion
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mind you, that does include illegal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have seen in North America is
as states were legalizing, there was about
[SPEAKER_00]: a 30% shift from illegal use to legal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a material opportunity,
an early stage opportunity here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else can we see from a trend
perspective when we look at the US?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we talk about the eight-year
economic cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That really does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real, because that's what we saw in
the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: From 2012 to 2020, we sort of saw a bell
curve type of shift in terms of the volume
[SPEAKER_00]: of investment that went into the industry,
the number of companies that started and
[SPEAKER_00]: went to market, as well as a quite diverse
sequencing of shift of the types of
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses that were ripe to profit and
succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk a little bit more about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's first talk about money.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the capital markets in North
America and the cannabis industry sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that the numbers do not
start in 2012 or in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because the type of investments
that went in early on in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry were primarily from angel
investors, some of them not even
[SPEAKER_00]: accredited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were really small checks.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came in, I raised my first million,
about $25,000 to $50,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was gruesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what happened there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the green rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was money floating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of investors sort of
writing checks, but they were small
[SPEAKER_00]: checks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the overall amounts were enlarged.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did begin to see a shift in 2015 and
2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened is the industry was
getting smarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And folks from outside of the cannabis
industry, venture capitalists,
[SPEAKER_00]: created cannabis-specific funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is still not non-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still not institutional investment,
per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was beginning to sort of operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: These funds were beginning to operate like
more mature venture capitalists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were starting to look at
financials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just about, ooh, you have
cultivation and weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's invest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started to begin to see sort of a shift
in maturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2017 to 2021 is where we really saw the
boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the graph, you can sort
of see that increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first and foremost, institutional
investors finally paid a attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: They began to see consumption in the
cannabis industry go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They began to see states legalizing being
able to have extra revenue to spend in
[SPEAKER_00]: things like education and a decrease in
crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the interest was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one, institutional investment
came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, there was a beginning of sort
of this idea of going public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it wasn't necessarily sort of the
boom that we saw all the way in 2019 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020, but there was a shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019 is where we really had an explosion,
and that was absolutely driven by the
[SPEAKER_00]: public market, both in Canada and the
United States, but mostly Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see this drop in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, COVID happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happened, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting to note in 2020 is
that the size of the checks of the deals
[SPEAKER_00]: were the largest ever in history.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about half a billion plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then 2021, we saw sort of a continuation
of the public market activity with a drop
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, why the drop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest one is poor performance of
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies were just not performing as well
as the investors were expected,
[SPEAKER_00]: and those institutional investors,
that mature capital market that came in,
[SPEAKER_00]: were not okay with the financial
performance and the ineffective operation
[SPEAKER_00]: of some of these businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that the birth of the cannabis
industry in the United States was really
[SPEAKER_00]: stemming from a movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the folks that came in were folks that
might have been in the illegal market
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in, so they weren't necessarily
awards and graduates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that it matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them succeeded, but overall,
they didn't have the level of
[SPEAKER_00]: sophistication in business to grow and
scale a business, something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably going to be very different here
in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting thing to note about
2022 is that we begin to see a shift from
[SPEAKER_00]: equity to debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, equity was too risky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So operators that now really needed to
scale and grow, especially from a surge of
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption during COVID, needed capital,
and they had nowhere to get it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so they went for debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has become very expensive since.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the United States today,
you have a really, really tight capital
[SPEAKER_00]: market, and many of those operators are
coming into Europe, where they feel
[SPEAKER_00]: there's more opportunity, there's more
liquidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both from an operator perspective and
an investor perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't matter if you're looking to
invest or if you're looking to put in a
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we learn from what happened in
sort of that eight to 10-year experience
[SPEAKER_00]: in the U.S.?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that 2012 to 2015, as I mentioned,
really, angel investment, small checks,
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, the green rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was cannabis, you were in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here in Europe, arguably,
we've kind of gone through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, we skipped the green rush
because of all the reasons I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is already a market that is starting
from a much more mature position.
[SPEAKER_00]: The operators and the investors that are
looking at this space are either coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: or North America, where they've already
learned their lessons and earned their
[SPEAKER_00]: stripes, or they are mature investors and
operators already established in Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: that are looking to diversify into the
cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that we skipped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I put in the European opportunities
sort of still a little bit to the left
[SPEAKER_00]: because they still are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some seed and plant touching
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that we truly are in sort of
that second phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we saw in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: between 2016 and 2018, where it really is
post seed, not so much plant touching,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still some plant touching, but really
we're looking at more sophisticated
[SPEAKER_00]: business and value propositions that truly
are looking to support those plant
[SPEAKER_00]: touching operators and the plant touching
vertical of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things that are very unique to
Europe and that we saw in the second phase
[SPEAKER_00]: in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is this introduction of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific, not hemp for CBD, of course,
medicinal use in Europe is extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: important, but advanced industrial
applications that the European market
[SPEAKER_00]: today has the benefit of really
capitalizing on because research and
[SPEAKER_00]: development has had 10 years to evolve
around the world and not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically in the United States or North
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is happening in Asia Pacific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, real estate in the
United States, well, it seems like a
[SPEAKER_00]: no-brainer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're cultivating or you're
processing, you obviously need real
[SPEAKER_00]: estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How come there's not a lot of investment
in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, lessons learned tell us real estate
is going to go up and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very interesting once we reach that apex
of consumption in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real estate is the real estate market and
it's definitely something that Europeans
[SPEAKER_00]: have an opportunity to look at right now
as it pertains to the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: between 2019 and 2022, what we saw,
as I mentioned, really the public market,
[SPEAKER_00]: but specifically we saw the emergence of
REITs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw the emergence of ETFs specific to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of SPACs, for better or for worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have time to dive deeper into
it, but the SPACs phenomenon in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States when it comes to cannabis was quite
tumultuous, let's just say, and a lot of M
[SPEAKER_00]: &A and IPOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the M&A was really sort of a
consolidation phenomena, whereby
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately the smaller companies or the
companies that weren't able to scale and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow or secure capital to scale and grow
were absorbed by others or went out of
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are still at that stage,
I would say, in the United States today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some very high-level key lessons learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mind you, I expected that the audience
today is sophisticated and some of this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to feel like a, duh, we know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is more a way to look at what
happened in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and the mistakes that we did make there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lessons that we learned from those
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also after 10 years of looking at
decks, and for better or for worse,
[SPEAKER_00]: raising capital, these are sort of the
things that truly rose to the surface as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as not what to do and not what to do
at this point in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honest and diverse leadership.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may seem sort of like a silly thing
to say or an obvious statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry, for better or for
worse, is still a little shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having an honest and diverse,
given that it's a global industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and mind you, I'm a woman and I'm a
half-Cuban woman, so that's also very dear
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But diversity and honesty in the industry
from a leadership perspective is extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: important in order to have a successful
business, if you believe in karma,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also to have the trust of an investor
and the capital market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowledgeable and professional management
may also seem obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cannabis industry, you do need
those folks that are veterans in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry that understand the
plant, that understand the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: that understand the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also need folks that truly
understand business and mature business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the competitive environment today
is much tougher than it was when I came in
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have health and beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have food and beverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some serious money and knowledge
that is interested in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your management needs to be up to the
task of navigating it and defending your
[SPEAKER_00]: position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear and substantiated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that's true in
cannabis and it's true anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before preparing for this chat,
I did kind of call all my pals that are
[SPEAKER_00]: still investing in cannabis and not in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of, you know, I asked the
question, you know, what are the three
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I really sort of make it or
break it for you in your thesis of
[SPEAKER_00]: investment, regardless of what you're
investing in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, clear market understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is if you're in the
cannabis industry, choose your vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be like all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be vertically integrated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be very clear and be able to substantiate
what your target addressable market is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are a lot of shiny objects
in the cannabis industry and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to be and they're very
distracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And investors do not like destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And destruction leads to inefficiency for
operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, clear and substantiated product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think doing it all is really the
way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have worked in the United States 10
years ago, but today I think in Europe
[SPEAKER_00]: there's really an opportunity to
specialize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the deeper and the niche, the more
niche you are, the more likely you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be able to defend and plant that
flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that definitely
wasn't on the board 10 years ago because
[SPEAKER_00]: it was new.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you prove traction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And investors are expecting you to prove
it and substantiate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that pilot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show what your consumer wants in that
engagement because it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't the green rush anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The don'ts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, alas, a good idea is not necessarily
a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: A business needs a business plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember my first pitch was in
Austin, Texas in like 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the only woman on stage and I was
the only one talking about something that
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't involve smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, someone on stage, and I tell this
a lot, literally booed and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can't smoke it, we don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was talking about data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that point, basically if you have a
PowerPoint and it said cannabis in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a business plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's no longer the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a real business plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not a 50 page PDF, but certainly
something that's well thought out with a
[SPEAKER_00]: mission, a vision, an actual financial
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all of the sort of infrastructure
of a real house when it comes to business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, competition cannot be ignored
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a global market where you're getting
competitors no longer just locally or
[SPEAKER_00]: across the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your competition is regional and global.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it at least to number three
that you need to be extremely thoughtful
[SPEAKER_00]: about your strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So businesses that do not have a very,
very clear operational financial and
[SPEAKER_00]: strategic plan are not only likely not to
be of interest to a sophisticated
[SPEAKER_00]: investor, but also likely not going to be
able to truly make it and succeed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, history does repeat itself,
but every time it does, the price goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that for us, that means that
we can make more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wish for all of you to be very
successful and very profitable in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much.
Thank you.
