[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Bridget.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Chief Science Officer of Pasha Brands
and how we look at product development and
[SPEAKER_03]: commercialization is really kind of
harnessing the essences of craft cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: coming out of small business owners that
did it just immensely well in the legacy
[SPEAKER_03]: market and should come in with their
extraction techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: To join me on today's panel, we welcome
Todd Delota who is the President of Zebra
[SPEAKER_03]: Brands and Todd has a legacy also of
really advocating and doing consulting for
[SPEAKER_03]: medical cannabis policy and representing
medical patient users.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had an immense amount of expertise
working with the Oregon Health Authorities
[SPEAKER_03]: and how that translated into giving more
medical patient access.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, educating the educators and I
think that's translated into Zebra's
[SPEAKER_03]: business model which will effectively help
cannabis producers get more sustainable
[SPEAKER_03]: practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much for being here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next on our expert panel is A.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: Braddock.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is not at all unfamiliar in this
sphere as CEO of Eden Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: A really prolific cannabis extraction firm
and technology innovator.
[SPEAKER_03]: A.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: has brought lots of R&D to this space,
almost 10 years in hardware and processes
[SPEAKER_03]: to bring cannabis cannabinoid oils to
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 years, there we have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's really representing the
heartbeat behind how we're going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: quality products to serve the demand that
today is here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next in line is Marcus Richardson,
Chief Cannabinoid Officer of MBARC Health.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mark has an immense amount of
expertise in cannabis extraction science,
[SPEAKER_03]: has worked at length with the equipment
and is going to give us our insights today
[SPEAKER_03]: on how really we bring the heart of the
farm flower back to formulations that are
[SPEAKER_03]: carefully put together through chemistry
art.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also how we're going to make them more
bio available and more attractive for more
[SPEAKER_03]: product diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks for being here, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last on the panel is of course our
representative legal counsel, Liam Ulster
[SPEAKER_03]: is an associate at Watson and Gopal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he represents a lot of commercial and
corporate law.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe he's going to bring to us an
examination of how IP and trademarking can
[SPEAKER_03]: create value for your organization,
especially in acquisitions that he carried
[SPEAKER_03]: out in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll talk a little bit about that
value chain when we start to bring this
[SPEAKER_03]: type of technology and formulations out to
the global marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well thanks everybody for
agreeing to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to start by discussing the
anticipated extracts regulatory release
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're expecting by Health Canada and
other jurisdictions who have coached on
[SPEAKER_03]: the matter in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: and what we can expect as challenges with
those regulations now recategorizing
[SPEAKER_03]: extracts, edibles and vape products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Liam let's start you off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, you have your mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you think we're going to
anticipate as challenges or issues with
[SPEAKER_03]: the new extracts regulations and how that
will affect your business adjusting
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially?
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad to find the mic is turned on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the good news is that a lot of
businesses who are active in the space
[SPEAKER_02]: have the tools needed and they're already
dealing with the problems that the new
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations are going to cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: October 17th, the supplementary
regulations for edibles, concentrates,
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts, there's already drafts of the
amendments online.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what that is going to require of
Canadian industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the good thing is there's now hard
guidelines, which means businesses can
[SPEAKER_02]: plan around those.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know hard caps about how much can be in
individual packages.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what the regulations are going to
require in terms of cleaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bad news is, like all Health Canada
regulations, I mean they've worked very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very hard to advance a specific public
health policy agenda.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means there's more onerous
requirements on businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the big changes which a lot of
businesses aren't planning for today is
[SPEAKER_02]: how it treats ingredients in the new
regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people are needing to treat
ingredients which would otherwise not be
[SPEAKER_02]: required to meet the high standards that
cannabis is treated inside a facility to
[SPEAKER_02]: that higher standard, which means more
cleaning requirements for equipment that
[SPEAKER_02]: deals with non-cannabis ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means that it's not just things like
your extraction technology which is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to need to meet that higher standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also means that segmented parts of your
equipment production line which don't
[SPEAKER_02]: touch cannabis are also going to need to
meet those higher quality standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of extra work to meet those
additional regulations, which means
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses really need to be thinking who
they're working with, what experience they
[SPEAKER_02]: have, and are they up to date on the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and how to create efficiencies and
how you've documented your practices and
[SPEAKER_03]: how you stick on that track and how you
get off, how you recognize when you get
[SPEAKER_03]: off track.
[SPEAKER_03]: So quality assurance, how do we educate
our the firms we're working with,
[SPEAKER_03]: our own business within our LPs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd, how do we look at extraction and
efficiencies with quality management,
[SPEAKER_03]: supply chain management?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you do it with Zebra?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, we're in this really
interesting situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're licensed to cultivate and extract in
Columbia, and if we want to export to the
[SPEAKER_01]: European market or many of the other
markets, we have to of course meet GMP
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the unique thing about Colombian law
is we have the requirement to get 10% of
[SPEAKER_01]: our biomass from small growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as many people may know, the
regulation in Colombia is a result of the
[SPEAKER_01]: peace process between a lot of the old
cartels and paramilitaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the small growers pretty much
represents them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to get a complete supply
chain of GMP of high quality, we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: have to educate and help these smaller
producers through to get their production
[SPEAKER_01]: up to GMP certification.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually document what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not deviate from a work order,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so fortunately, you know,
I have a lot of, you know, background in
[SPEAKER_01]: education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're establishing connections with
indigenous growers and trade associations
[SPEAKER_01]: that are focused on small growers getting
involved, not just for the relationships,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also to kind of convey this type of
education and training, as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: desire to play the game and meet these
standards, you know, for providing
[SPEAKER_01]: economic opportunities to these small
growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, there's such a demand for high
quality distillates, isolates,
[SPEAKER_03]: across obviously the main ones CBD is
always in high demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as the other cannabinoids come to
therapeutic market, there's quite the
[SPEAKER_03]: demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from the extraction sciences,
what can we expect the future of CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: isolates, distillates in that market?
[SPEAKER_03]: AC, why don't you give us your
perspective?
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to remind everybody with what
we're still in prohibition.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only reason we're still talking
and we talk about CBD at all, is because
[SPEAKER_07]: of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we didn't have prohibition,
we would be talking about all the
[SPEAKER_07]: different cannabinoids and all the terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we would have products that are
actually medically relevant.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a fan of going down this path.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's extremely detrimental to
medical applications, conscious
[SPEAKER_07]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, you are hearing that full
spectrum oils and formulations are still
[SPEAKER_03]: the hot item to bring from prohibition
time, or would you be shaping more towards
[SPEAKER_03]: the demand for isolates?
[SPEAKER_07]: The very, very first thing that was taken
out of a plant, because they thought it
[SPEAKER_07]: was the strongest thing out of the plant,
and this was the best thing to do,
[SPEAKER_07]: was in 1805, which set our whole medical
industry down this path, was morphine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So is that a viable pathway?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, why are we not talking about the
endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just established in 1992, that is current
medical science.
[SPEAKER_07]: Going back and taking a plant apart to
study it, especially clinically,
[SPEAKER_07]: will take decades.
[SPEAKER_07]: Decades.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to be doing it from the other
side, where we're looking at a system
[SPEAKER_07]: treating a system.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is real medical science.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you would then suggest that if we do
extraction from the flower, or obtain
[SPEAKER_03]: formulations in the natural health
products category, how do they come
[SPEAKER_03]: applicable for clinical work, health and
wellness work, and or even just adult use?
[SPEAKER_03]: Small business.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's a small business ever going to go
through a clinical trial?
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll wipe out the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it'll limit access to patients,
if we can continue to go down this path.
[SPEAKER_07]: This whole vape pen thing, which is
really, really tragic, I think though in
[SPEAKER_07]: the end, it may be better for the cannabis
industry to have differentiated between
[SPEAKER_07]: nicotine and additives, and what this
industry has been built on, and that is
[SPEAKER_07]: whole plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Marcus, quiet over there, and I see you
nodding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is your perspective on full
spectrum products, you know, holding the
[SPEAKER_03]: quality and making it out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, I have my own opinions on
all of these things, of course,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I've learned that my opinion,
well, that the industry itself and that
[SPEAKER_05]: the people that require to access this
medicine are bigger than my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was like the most hardened water
extraction, solventless, dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people know me as that guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now being involved with a company where
we're going to be processing all sorts of
[SPEAKER_05]: different ways, it surprises some people.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, for me, I see them both
having a place.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see full spectrum all the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were, you know, Dave Watson,
Skunkman Sam, the original breeder from
[SPEAKER_05]: Horta Farm, who bred the cultivars for GW.
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally the first CBD cultivars,
he was the one who taught us in 2000,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you can imagine, 18 to 19 years ago,
we were in his apartment in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_05]: and he did this with Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_05]: He did this with Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the people that are really leading
the conversation in the modulating effects
[SPEAKER_05]: of terpenes came from Dave.
[SPEAKER_05]: He taught us all.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the one that had all the pure
cannabinoids, all the pure terpenes,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then sat us down and one by one gave
us bong rips with and without terpenes to
[SPEAKER_05]: modulate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that really sort of, at that point in
time, I became very like, these are the
[SPEAKER_05]: most important, they're so important,
they're modulating the effects,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're creating all these medicinal
components.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of was also in the same,
you know, boat as AC, kind of thinking
[SPEAKER_05]: like, what, do we really need to separate
and isolate everything?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the more I started learning about
the science, the more I started meeting
[SPEAKER_05]: people who were extremely sensitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them were Dravet syndrome
children, gastro-Lennox children,
[SPEAKER_05]: extremely sensitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Neurological disorders, cannabinoids can
be extremely beneficial for them,
[SPEAKER_05]: whole plant cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the problem is, is that from grow to
grow, depending on your terroir,
[SPEAKER_05]: depending on how much of your environment
you're controlling, little things can
[SPEAKER_05]: change and alter the profile of your
terpenes in that known cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now you have a small child,
she's using this medicine, it's working
[SPEAKER_05]: for her.
[SPEAKER_05]: After three months, she gets a new crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not working the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see the value from a perspective of
taking cannabis apart, isolating the
[SPEAKER_05]: components, and creating formulations for
patients like that, that are accurate each
[SPEAKER_05]: and every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And more importantly, we don't have to
pick sides.
[SPEAKER_05]: We now can all choose the avenues we want
to go down.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can go down full spectrum, we can go
down distillates and isolates,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think that we just shouldn't spend
time working against methods that we don't
[SPEAKER_05]: see eye to eye with as much as just
focusing on the methods that we want to
[SPEAKER_05]: promote.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is cannabis, and there's
literally like 1,000 pathways to take.
[SPEAKER_07]: And fortunately, in Canada, you have
multiple pathways, because you also have a
[SPEAKER_07]: nutraceutical pathway, which we don't have
in the US.
[SPEAKER_07]: You actually have a definition for that
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's medical, nutraceutical,
and then there's also conscious
[SPEAKER_07]: consumption or lifestyle.
We don't want that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point I wanted to make too,
and I'm not against isolates.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that we should look at
everything instead of hyper focusing on
[SPEAKER_07]: something because of a political situation
that we're in.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Tikim Olam in Israel has been doing
studies on CBD for well over a decade,
[SPEAKER_07]: and on CBD, and they discovered it has a
bell curve.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's effective, it's effective,
it's effective, and then it stops being
[SPEAKER_07]: effective.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can add more CBD, but it doesn't
increase the efficacy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It actually starts to drop off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs competition with another
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to have the full plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And once they added that back in,
and they found a strain out of Spain that
[SPEAKER_07]: they utilized, and once they added that
back in, efficacy increased and
[SPEAKER_07]: stabilized.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's something there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to make sure that we pay
attention to what that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But upon identifying this race ratio,
say, of these synergistic-like chemical
[SPEAKER_03]: molecules, then you could dial them back
into a dose for an application,
[SPEAKER_03]: still leaving the heartbeat behind
somebody who just wants to take it through
[SPEAKER_03]: a natural health product.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very powerful if you bioassay it,
if you have access to pure cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_05]: and pure terpene fractions.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no denying the fact that hitting
THCA pure in a pipe is a very wonderful
[SPEAKER_05]: one-dimensional experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very couch lock.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very sedative.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you put a single terpene with that
THCA, and it is literally like curtains
[SPEAKER_05]: opening up and the whole band showing up,
which is literally why Ethan called it the
[SPEAKER_05]: entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Dr. Lester Grinspoon called it
the ensemble effect, which really,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's profound.
[SPEAKER_03]: So lots of companies are going to be
investing and trying to be versatile in
[SPEAKER_03]: their tech, right, to accomplish exactly
what we said.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what in your mind right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll start with Liam on the
acquisition or tech companies that are
[SPEAKER_03]: putting in extraction equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you put the value?
[SPEAKER_03]: What type of extraction is leading for
large, scalable companies?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everyone on the panel has said it
well in their own different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a thousand different ways that
you can go in this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Companies are valuing very different
things based on their values, based on
[SPEAKER_02]: their business models, based on the people
they're working with, based on their
[SPEAKER_02]: partnerships, based on the jurisdiction
that they're in, which wildly changes the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations they need to comply with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, the short answer is every
business values something different,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there are a few common things which
everybody's looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's looking at integration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, for example, there's a specific
concentration with a specific formula,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're looking at how can we use this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who can we partner with that this
formulation makes sense if it's used in
[SPEAKER_02]: vape cartridges or if it's given direct to
consumer or if it's used in some other
[SPEAKER_02]: ancillary derivative product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's looking at how they can use
different formulas.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are looking at strategic
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who can use this if you work with them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what they're doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows how to maximize the value?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the value of this thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I can tell you everybody on this
panel has a different knowledge of
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of products and they'd all
use it very differently in their own
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are looking at IP rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what comes with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of companies, there's nothing magic
to their formulas.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no special concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have Plant Breeders Rights Act
rights in any product that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people look at what rights come
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a brand name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it from a specific plant that has some
interesting genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people look at not just the
formulation but where it comes from,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the sourcing of not just the plants
but the producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That carries a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to look at all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A business has to look at all of these
different metrics and find out what makes
[SPEAKER_02]: sense as part of its business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Todd, you are actively pursuing
partners in different geographies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Countries that will likely have access to
different equipment, different expertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where do you put value back as an
aggregate as you look at all these
[SPEAKER_03]: countries you're partnering with?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you see the value back in pursuing
international partnerships like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, about 95% of the global cannabis
industry is entirely on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: They exist solely on pitch decks and
PowerPoint presentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just amazing how some of these
companies get tens of million dollar
[SPEAKER_01]: market caps when all they really have are
a few LOIs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I read business plans like this,
people who are kind of seasoned in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis can really sniff out the BS
really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're saying they're producing on a
couple hundred hectares but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: running it through a 20 liter CO2
extractor, there is something amiss there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look at all these business plans and
I really look for a sensible flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something about what they're doing that
really makes sense from cultivation and
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding through extraction and finished
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Formulation as well as their distribution
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the end, could you then conclude how
much inventory is going to come from that
[SPEAKER_03]: particular producer?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be their yield?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think you'll get better at cutting
through the BS of we've got this square
[SPEAKER_03]: foot, we've got this many shifts to get
this product to the secondary processor.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you think you will get more clear
on determining that part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: partnership in Columbia actually returning
world class supply, world qualified
[SPEAKER_03]: supply?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just if you get through the
executive summary of a business plan,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really just about finding out
who's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not actually growing and
extracting and doing their operations,
[SPEAKER_01]: do these people have the capacity to do it
well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have the track record in another
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really about going out there
and finding out what's real and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: just on paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we'll segue a little bit now into
technical formulations and the laws that
[SPEAKER_03]: perhaps prohibit them into things like
vapes or edibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the controversy of certain stigma
around vape pens being prefaced in
[SPEAKER_03]: California is perhaps leading to illness
or even fatalities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could I just make one point on what he was
saying in regards to your question on how
[SPEAKER_05]: you see the value of international
relationships?
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I will go right back to the vape pens,
but it was a really important point that I
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted to make was for me as an extractor,
the value of relationships outside of
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada relate directly to terroir and the
earth and the ground and all of the
[SPEAKER_05]: environmental details that that plant is
growing under.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why lavender expresses itself
very specially from France.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's known as like the best lavender in
the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cannabis isn't going to be any
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And places like Columbia and Thailand and
Jamaica have for many decades been known
[SPEAKER_05]: to produce nice cannabis, but there are
going to be some places in the world where
[SPEAKER_05]: novel cannabinoids and terpenes are
produced where they won't be produced
[SPEAKER_05]: elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in a tropical environment where the
cultivars are narrow-leafed drug cultivars
[SPEAKER_05]: rather than the wide-leafed drug
cultivars, those are also part of
[SPEAKER_05]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the problem with prohibition is that
the greedy prohibition mindset of how much
[SPEAKER_05]: can I get and how fast can I get it cut
out narrow-leafed drug cultivars and made
[SPEAKER_05]: an in pathway for wide-leafed cultivars,
indicas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we lost a lot of novel
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: We lost a lot of novel terpenes,
those exotic flavors that only come... But
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd have to be able to measure them in
those places that they were cultivated and
[SPEAKER_03]: that legacy was there to build lots of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will tell you not all countries have
labs that can test this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't necessarily ship it around to
get mass spec data.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be amazed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been like Jamaica, which is
definitely has much less of an
[SPEAKER_05]: infrastructure than Columbia.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have two proton NMRs at the
University of West Indies.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like proton NMRs are like beyond...
Right, but you also need expertise on
[SPEAKER_03]: identifying new phyto cannabinoid
features.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think where you're going though is maybe
the value is on actually getting research
[SPEAKER_03]: collaboration so that samples can actually
travel so that we can study them to that
[SPEAKER_03]: nature to see if there are any
differentiating products in Egypt,
[SPEAKER_03]: Lebanon versus the cultivars that would be
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that has some value to then partner
across universities and other places,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you now have some IP perhaps that
associates with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, up until this point, we've seen
cultivation go where the legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that legalization is going across
the globe, we're seeing the cultivation go
[SPEAKER_01]: to where cultivation is best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are some countries like
Columbia that have very good laws in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of being able to grow a lot of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Columbia also has several climate
zones as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's going to places,
Jamaica, Caribbean Islands, Southeast
[SPEAKER_01]: Asia, going to different places in the
world that may not see the best
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities for broad scale cultivation,
but you could find those unique cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where then maybe you need now extraction
technology with the right chemistry output
[SPEAKER_03]: that at least you get a high quality resin
that can be further distilled and then
[SPEAKER_03]: characterized specified.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we identify new things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can mix them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can build partnerships that could
bootstrap commercial value to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the next wave?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we have to do to cannabinoids to
get them out commercially?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some emulsification
techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think the next wave is?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think nano emulsification is
definitely a cool way to get cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_05]: that are otherwise non soluble and liquid
to be able to disperse properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I first saw it as a liposome based
nanoparticle and then I saw the mesial
[SPEAKER_05]: based nanoparticles and each one seemed to
create more of a bios availability.
[SPEAKER_05]: The onset is very quick and I think that
people will enjoy, you know, drinking
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think they're all kind of all of
those techniques are so similar,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's gonna be hard to figure out what
really is real, what really could be a
[SPEAKER_03]: game changer for availability in different
tissues?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure the cream will rise to the crop
as it always does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like he said earlier, Todd said
earlier, it's about trying to find out
[SPEAKER_05]: who's real.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like, we're probably gonna be
in that for a couple more years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these companies in California have
been building these nano emulsification.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not many more waters in California
that I would say are amazing because I can
[SPEAKER_03]: drink an amount of emulsified formulation
of cannabinoids in my water.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think it really needs to pull
it ahead?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it more bench science?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it more scalability?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it more QAQC?
[SPEAKER_05]: Personally, I think it's about maybe
convincing people that THC isn't dangerous
[SPEAKER_05]: and that you don't have to protect your
children from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They still haven't come out from the
massive lie that this is a dangerous
[SPEAKER_05]: compound.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they still wanna protect it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just plutonium or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just always listen, we lied,
we just wanted to arrest brown people and
[SPEAKER_05]: do all the heinous things that they did
under prohibition, which they've continued
[SPEAKER_05]: to do and which AC mentioned earlier,
they're still doing today.
[SPEAKER_05]: While we talk about this, try not to
forget that this is not legal all around
[SPEAKER_05]: the world for everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's still people even in
California having their doors kicked down
[SPEAKER_05]: and having all of their businesses
destroyed.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a reality that we're in still.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everywhere, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's astounding what prohibition
and that propaganda that came out of early
[SPEAKER_07]: 1930s in the US did to the entire world's
perception of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's astounding and it's sticking hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they lacked the education and or
knowledge to decouple potency against THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're all gonna say that,
I've smoked or had extracts that had
[SPEAKER_03]: weighted to the other families of
cannabinoids and I still feel high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that linkage of potency or impairment
has got to be decoupled from the word or
[SPEAKER_03]: the acronym THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the question about new
technology is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've been doing extractions on
multiple different kinds of things for a
[SPEAKER_07]: really long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have talked about it about
extractions on multiple, multiple
[SPEAKER_07]: different panels for years.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what I find interesting now is not
how, but why.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you gonna do it that way?
[SPEAKER_07]: What social ill is that curing?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your mission as a company?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you gonna do it like that?
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I would like to see as a
improvement into this industry is coupling
[SPEAKER_07]: it with natural products.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have, I mean, there are two hockey
stick industries and we suffer from the
[SPEAKER_07]: same prejudices from Big Farm and from
multiple other areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we can get together as one unified
plant medicine, plant nutrition industry,
[SPEAKER_07]: we would have tremendous power.
[SPEAKER_07]: And think of the products.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, marrying cannabis with ginger for
nausea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Huge, but are we seeing much of that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm shocked really that I'm not
seeing more of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on September 4th, actually Health
Canada did put out a consultation of which
[SPEAKER_03]: we could consult back on somewhat of these
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll call them cannabis health products.
[SPEAKER_03]: How could they be put to market without a
medical practitioner's oversight?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did voice, but now that's gotta get
digested and roll out of some kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: standard policy that could either
alleviate risk or help products really get
[SPEAKER_03]: to market that were done in a documented
traceable way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, it might help them understand
or get over treating cannabis that's not
[SPEAKER_07]: molecularized into CBD or something else
that has all the danger components taken
[SPEAKER_07]: out and just recognizes it's a plant,
like the other plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can create policy around plants
instead of separating them all out into
[SPEAKER_07]: ones that are more dangerous than others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we do it on maple syrup too up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: A and B grade, C grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll go to the audience,
please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe kick out a few questions for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a question over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start over here and we'll work our
way down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here I come, here I come.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it again for the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very informative, entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is high CBD hemp going to be
to your industry to provide broad spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: but high CBD products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would, as a plant breeder,
when we say high CBD cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully we're thinking of other
phytochemicals as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now a lot of the breeding effort
is going to spiking that CBD level as high
[SPEAKER_01]: as we can and the THC level as low as we
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the innovative breeders that are
also looking to look at all of the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: levels in their breeding and not just
looking at the high CBD and low THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think as we go, keep on engaging in
research with CBD crops, we'll discover a
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic and phytochemical relationships
that may be unique to some higher,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we call higher CBD plants that may be
unique compared to high THC plants or that
[SPEAKER_01]: express themselves in different ways in
different climates and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we need to really be thinking way
beyond those two cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and it's a real problem right now
and I can tell you from eating and
[SPEAKER_07]: supplying these extraction systems to help
companies that a lot of them are not doing
[SPEAKER_07]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's happening is they're finally
starting to get harvests in and a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: them are hot and they're trying to figure
out how to remediate out that THC and
[SPEAKER_07]: because a lot of these, because the
point's been made, they're grown in
[SPEAKER_07]: different places, they do different
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they go through milling processes that
are the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: To just be sitting there focusing on this
one cannabinoid for multiple reasons,
[SPEAKER_07]: but the whole 0.3 is so arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, where did that come from?
[SPEAKER_06]: And stupid, stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll also say, I would say more than any
other question that I get asked,
[SPEAKER_02]: those of you in the room, don't raise your
hands, but a lot of you have asked me
[SPEAKER_02]: questions about this this weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get asked about the industrial hemp
regulations in Canada and the arbitrary
[SPEAKER_02]: cutoff of the 0.3% THC content,
what parts of the plant do you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: process or license for?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a ridiculous system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the reality is that high CBD,
low THC plant matter has very specific
[SPEAKER_02]: uses, but it's regulated in an incredibly
complicated way with very specific
[SPEAKER_02]: restrictions on use and business has to
deal with the consequences and it makes my
[SPEAKER_02]: life a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know everyone in this room,
it makes your life harder too.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some states in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_07]: where the regulatory bodies don't
understand it so much and law enforcement
[SPEAKER_07]: don't understand it, that when their
fields come up hot, they are required to
[SPEAKER_07]: burn them instead of remediating.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so my question is when we talk about
industrial hemp, that's cleaning up dirty
[SPEAKER_06]: nutrients in the soil, what happens to
that dirty nutrients and that dirty hemp?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're talking about the phytoremediative
properties of cannabis, of hemp,
[SPEAKER_05]: because hemp has been known to remove
radioactive nucleotides out of soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really is up to the integrity of
who's planting that hemp, what are they
[SPEAKER_05]: doing with it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they burning it and glassifying the
ash?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they like throwing it into a river?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as you know, a lot of different
people do a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so the question really is,
we know that these are dirty properties,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we're not regulating against it,
we're regulating so vigorously against
[SPEAKER_06]: THC, but then we're not regulating on
things that really matter to our health as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, if we were regulating things that
really matter to our health, we would
[SPEAKER_05]: regulate the air that we breathe and the
water that we drink and the food that we
[SPEAKER_05]: consume on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But everything has been so deregulated and
lets everyone complain about cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations now and deregulate them too,
so we can go buy hot dog water at a gas
[SPEAKER_05]: station that burns a hole in our lung.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have to understand exactly
what remediation is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bioremediation is too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some things that the plant will absorb
that toxic molecule into, but others,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a full transformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times it's not even the plant
that's doing the transformation,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the soil microbes that associate with
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually some toxins, depending on what
you're talking about, can be completely
[SPEAKER_01]: just disappeared and reconstructed,
but some of them, the more radioactive
[SPEAKER_01]: types get, and of course those types we
don't want to enter into our food chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's appropriate to grow fiber hemp as a
way to bioremediate soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We shouldn't be bioremediating soil that
goes into any consumable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiber hemp, especially for industrial
purposes, is very appropriate for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really have to understand what do we
mean by bioremediation and what types of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis crops are most appropriate for
bioremediation.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want a quick little history lesson,
how phytoremediation in cannabis was
[SPEAKER_05]: discovered was in Canada in 1994 when Joe
Strobel, a tobacco farmer, tobacco farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: notoriously spray their tobacco with a
radioactive nucleotide called Radium-226.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he had been spraying his field with the
Radium-226, and him and Jeff Keim,
[SPEAKER_05]: the lawyer that got the license,
they got the first license in Canada in
[SPEAKER_05]: 1994 before all of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all got our licenses the next year,
like four other groups.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they measured the field, which they're
forced to do for these tobacco fields,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they measured the radioactive levels,
and they found out that the levels were
[SPEAKER_05]: shockingly low.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were like, where did it go?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they looked over at the hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that actually birthed the idea of a
company called Consolidated Growers and
[SPEAKER_05]: Processors where we went, it was a company
I was a part of, we went and planted a
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp in Chernobyl to remove radioactivity
out of the soil there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was absolutely working.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's hear it for Bridget Simons and the
rest of the panel here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very informative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
