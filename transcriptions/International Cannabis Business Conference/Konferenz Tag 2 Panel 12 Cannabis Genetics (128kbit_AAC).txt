[SPEAKER_05]: So really happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got a great panelists of well quite a few
Canadians actually on the on the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna go through we don't have a ton
of time but we'll go through some
[SPEAKER_05]: introductions.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll find out what got each of these guys
into genetics and then we'll just kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: start a organic conversation and see where
it takes us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess we'll start with you Manny if
you just want to introduce yourself and
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe you know give a little bit of a
background.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have a ton of time so it's like a
couple of minutes to three minutes each.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just what got you into genetics and how
you ended up on this pathway?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: What up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada's in the house I can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm Manny De Silva.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was originally born in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hold dual citizenship as I'm a Canadian
citizen as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: My experience started with cannabis when I
was about 14 and started growing when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was about 15, 16 and quickly learned that
there was more to this plant than just
[SPEAKER_02]: putting a seed in the ground and we
started experimenting with different males
[SPEAKER_02]: and females and it just became a lifelong
passion to be able to see the different
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions that we could get out of each
individual cannabis strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That led me to make transition into the
legal market in early 2015-2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: Owned my own facility which I just sold
last year and in the meantime I had met
[SPEAKER_02]: some wonderful people in Israel and we
started a company out of there called
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Boys and we do import-export of
high-grade, only high-grade cannabis out
[SPEAKER_02]: of Canada to various parts in the world
and we also supply genetics to various
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well Ja bless you for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dave same question you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little introduction and how you got into
the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Dave Auger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the Commissioner for Big League
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been selling genetics across Canada
for the past two and a half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my start in cannabis breeding and
genetics the first time I ever grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew some Panama Red and some Blueberry
and White Widow, ended up with a male,
[SPEAKER_00]: threw some pollen around and was pretty
excited about the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a 20,000 square foot grow that
we produce cannabis for international
[SPEAKER_00]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have some new stuff doing an
epic drop here in Germany in the next few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks and we sell flower into Israel and
we provide genetics now all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about you Steve?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Steve Tan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started growing 26 years ago,
turn of the century.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did I get into it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew three strains for nearly four
years, NL5 Haze, Sensei Star, UK Cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came out of the dot-com boom making too
much money going into weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since then I've traveled the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoyed Marcus's company when he had
dreadlocks in a tent coming out of
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: Must have been what, 2001, 2002.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fast forward that, mucked around in
California for three or four years,
[SPEAKER_04]: played in the Bay Area, grew in hybrid
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the moving ship.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indoor bores me these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cater genetics for greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like a lot of the minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to put flavor on CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like these little interesting niche
markets and I think weed should be for
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can all debate about high THC and all
that jazz, but I think there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: areas that I think in two or three years
will become more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I invite everyone here to push against the
boundaries and release products that your
[SPEAKER_04]: marketing companies are telling you we can
only have these kind of profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sensory panels in Canada just started and
I think those things are good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really understanding your supply chain
after genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Innovation happens after you have to
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcus talked about something about rosin
and supply chain with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you can have a cold line going
straight through, and I remember that talk
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere, you can't show the strength of
those genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Extraction genetics are going to be very
different from dry flower genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Equatorial greenhouse genetics are going
to be very different from Canadian
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'll just stop there.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll finish off with Jameson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Marcus.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Jameson Wellborn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm managing director of the Banyan Tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with a lot of legacy participants
to leverage their intellectual property,
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly through seeds and cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: My relationship with the plant started a
little later at the end of high school,
[SPEAKER_01]: and by university I was lighting up
multiple houses and having a really good
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was an ADHD child, and so when I found
cannabis, I really found what worked for
[SPEAKER_01]: me, and it curtailed my alcohol and other
drug consumption and made a major positive
[SPEAKER_01]: impact in my life, and it's something I
continued on.
[SPEAKER_01]: After university, I kind of came clean
with what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing for my beer money to my family,
and what I wanted to continue doing with
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, and they quickly put a stop to
that, so I worked in the corporate world
[SPEAKER_01]: for about four or five years before seeing
the light at the end of the tunnel in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada and legalization, and started
consulting in the space, working with a
[SPEAKER_01]: few publicly traded companies,
and then ultimately helping a few startups
[SPEAKER_01]: get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: One cultivation business, one genetic
business that's up here beside me,
[SPEAKER_01]: before I decided to go off on my own and
start my own business, and yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spent more time putting my focus and
energy into championing the breeders and
[SPEAKER_01]: phenohunters and hash makers than I have
actually done in breeding myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I really like to think of myself as
more of an agent that is able to speak and
[SPEAKER_01]: bring these talented artists into these
newly legal markets and leverage all the
[SPEAKER_01]: work that they've done in the quote
unquote gray space.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that brings me to the next question,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: The legacy market and the market,
the history of breeding in cannabis has
[SPEAKER_05]: often been connected to these almost
savant-like people who are spending time
[SPEAKER_05]: with the plant, they're going in and
they're checking subtle nuances in the
[SPEAKER_05]: grows, whether it's outdoor, greenhouse,
indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm wondering what you guys all think,
and I'll give you all the chance to answer
[SPEAKER_05]: this question.
[SPEAKER_05]: How you see breeding moving into the
future away from traditional methods and
[SPEAKER_05]: into tissue culture, CRISPR methods,
DNA fingerprinting, where we can now
[SPEAKER_05]: identify very easily through tissue
culture and fingerprinting what gene
[SPEAKER_05]: synthases are present on the plant,
whether they're turned off or turned on,
[SPEAKER_05]: and how is this going to help us breed for
novel cannabinoids, novel volatile organic
[SPEAKER_05]: compounds as we move out of traditional
methodologies and gain these scientific
[SPEAKER_05]: advantages?
[SPEAKER_05]: We can start with you if you like,
Manny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that we're starting
to see is the recognition between the
[SPEAKER_02]: human and cannabinoid system and the
cannabinoids that are produced by the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The outlying area that we're missing is
the connection between those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not every single strain is going to work
for every single patient, and point in
[SPEAKER_02]: case you look at Charlotte's Web that was
an amazing discovery for Charlotte,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a lot of children that were brought
and given the same medicine did not do
[SPEAKER_02]: well with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The efficacy wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think through breeding and
through using things like DNA,
[SPEAKER_02]: human DNA, we can find that connection and
be able to prescribe better medicine for
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Manny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dave?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not growing in basements and attics
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're big league genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the big leagues now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting scientists involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA is a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are viruses and all kinds of
different things that you need to look out
[SPEAKER_00]: for as it relates to the commercialization
of a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because something worked in
somebody's backyard or their tent doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that you're going to be able to
operate 100,000 square feet of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And put food on family's tables and
participate in international commerce and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more and more science is going to be
dedicated to this over the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marker assisted breeding is already
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to continue that
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve?
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcus?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that topic, I might hijack that
topic because we have a startup and we've
[SPEAKER_04]: already done two CRISPR Cas9 edits.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got these seeds now at the
University of Guelph.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've done knock-ins and knock-outs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't actually realize you were going
to pose a question like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to plug our biotech startup
called Hypercan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're working with a molecular
biologist who has also developed
[SPEAKER_04]: best-of-class yeast-based enzymes with
improved cannabinoid synthases.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to go backwards and forwards on the
question, Jonathan Page at Anandia really
[SPEAKER_04]: did a lot of great work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think he was based maybe in Berlin,
I forget.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at that stage, corporate cannabis
definitely knocks good R&D down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because to do good plant R&D, you're
really talking 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way the corporate cannabis
situation that's happened in Canada has
[SPEAKER_04]: made me realize that working with
universities provides me with a longer,
[SPEAKER_04]: more stable pathway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've taken these seeds which,
for the record, are non-GMO point mutation
[SPEAKER_04]: edits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we breed these seeds,
we will be crossing these point mutations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our first knock-out is actually taking
THC out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can produce a plant that is truly 0%
THC for markets like the Asian market,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Japanese market, which want to grow
cannabinoids but they don't want THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, editing and engineering
won't come up in our space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, at least three to five
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Marker-assisted breeding and pangenomic
work is happening very strongly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll plug, you know, a great company
in Switzerland called Pure Gene.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've done amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are also other companies,
I believe, in Canada and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: many more in different states that are
working on these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what they have and what we didn't
have is they have scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: They obviously have science.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to measure minor cannabinoids like
CBCVs and these kind of things,
[SPEAKER_04]: you really need science behind you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we can't test smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't use our CPG values to understand
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we don't have the ailments.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I couldn't tell you if a CBD
product works.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just couldn't tell you as a user.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, you know, science is going to
take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe in legacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the CPG, the flavor, the Louis
Vuitton, the Louis XIII alcohol,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's all going to come from a
CPG value brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel that we'll all be in that
empowerment.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think, you know, we will have to
play with these guys because they are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to build bulletproof plants that are
PM resistance, viroid resistance,
[SPEAKER_04]: but then they'll need our flavor profiles
to layer with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's where that relationship
will be.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll build powerhouse cars,
but they'll still need us to put the
[SPEAKER_04]: flavor on it, or at least I hope.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, yeah, I think that's where we
are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Jameson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that over the next 10 years,
there's going to be a clear and definitive
[SPEAKER_01]: line between artistic breeding and
phenohunting and scientific backed
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I say that is just like
tobacco, we're seeing the actual smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: combustion of tobacco reduce, but we're
seeing the vaporization of nicotine pens
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see that same thing take
place over these markets in any legalized
[SPEAKER_01]: or unlegalized market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each market happens to be at a
different point in its evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you really look at the ability to
assign drug identification numbers,
[SPEAKER_01]: make medical applications, you're going to
see individuals using CRISPR and things
[SPEAKER_01]: that Stephen talked about to separate out
different parts of the plant where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have certain breeding projects
made for specific volatile organic
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the THC and CBD that that plant
produces or the overall inflorescence of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant isn't going to be a vital key
factor because that's going to be destined
[SPEAKER_01]: for isolation and extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those different marker-assisted
breeding projects where one will be for
[SPEAKER_01]: high THC, one will be for CBD,
one will be for beta-karyophylline,
[SPEAKER_01]: one will be for valencine, will all be
utilized en masse and extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're not looking for the
optimal concert of all of the different
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics that you're looking for
that we see in artistic phenohunting and
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding where the plant needs to hit
hard, taste good, be powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_01]: mold-resistant and, you know, resistant to
drops in cold temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those factors won't have to all line up
when you're only focusing on one
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that will be isolated to the
medical side where extraction focus drug
[SPEAKER_01]: identification numbers are being sought
after and that will likely be the larger
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the craft, you know, artisanal
side is going to still remain with the
[SPEAKER_01]: phenohunters who are looking for that
overall experience in that plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I definitely don't think you're
wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see in these pharmaceutical markets that
they want to stabilize and I mean they're
[SPEAKER_05]: scientists so they have to understand that
stabilizing volatile organic compounds is
[SPEAKER_05]: impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is what Jameson's saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got one group who are like,
let's stabilize it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how do you stabilize it?
[SPEAKER_05]: You short path molecularly distill it,
you reduce all of the volatile compounds
[SPEAKER_05]: out of it and then you're left with
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh look, it's stable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but now it's boring.
[SPEAKER_05]: It no longer has those volatile organic
compounds but it does fit into the
[SPEAKER_05]: pathways that are this sort of,
this medical pharmaceutical pathway.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also wanted to talk to you guys a little
bit about the importance of tissue
[SPEAKER_05]: culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the clonally produced plants on the
planet currently being clonally produced
[SPEAKER_05]: are done through tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis is one of the only plants that's
not done through tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question I wanted to pose to each
of you as breeders that are producing
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics or representing these artisan
breeders that you're selling their
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics, how important is it for you guys
to understand because if you give someone
[SPEAKER_05]: a plant that is completely impregnated
with viruses and bacteria and fungi and
[SPEAKER_05]: they go and try to grow this genetic,
it doesn't matter how good of a grower
[SPEAKER_05]: they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to be able to get the
plant to express itself the way it should.
[SPEAKER_05]: Often in the industry, this looks bad on
the breeder instead of the grower who's,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's not even the grower's fault in
that sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how important do you guys think it's
going to be to have your genetics
[SPEAKER_05]: initiated through tissue culture to have
any type of anything, bacteria,
[SPEAKER_05]: fungi, viruses removed from the plant
before it goes into production?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do any of you guys think of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, tissue culture's immensely
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a silver bullet, but it's
absolutely, especially with Germany and
[SPEAKER_00]: European markets and international markets
operating all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like Marcus said, if you've got
viruses, you've got problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds aren't necessarily safe,
and so we have a tissue culture lab for
[SPEAKER_00]: Big League.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure others of you up here also
working with tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a very useful tool in the
toolbox to be able to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got stuff stored in vitro that is
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of phenohunting at our
facility, and so we will run large
[SPEAKER_00]: populations of different types of seeds
that we don't know what might have been,
[SPEAKER_00]: what might be contracted, and so you want
to make sure that when you're starting a
[SPEAKER_00]: new facility or taking in genetics from
somewhere else, that it's been tested,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's safe, or at least as safe as you
can be, and then making sure that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got the fail safes in place to be able to
take care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I completely agree with Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're selling championship racing
horses or premier breeding dogs,
[SPEAKER_01]: they need to come with their hip shot and
all the test results, and that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: what this is, bringing this into a time
where all the T's need to be crossed and
[SPEAKER_01]: I's need to be dotted, and when you're
realizing the value and having,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the time that we save these
cultivators through these phenohunting
[SPEAKER_01]: processes, a lot of these cultivators,
I know we saw it in Canada where they
[SPEAKER_01]: would raise a bunch of money, they'd make
a bunch of promises to their shareholders,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they'd say, you know,
we've got a bunch of seeds, and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to hit the ground running,
and we're going to have a crop ready in
[SPEAKER_01]: four months for you guys, and then the
C-suite learns about this phenohunting
[SPEAKER_01]: process, and the growers at the board
table trying to explain what phenohunting
[SPEAKER_01]: is, and he's going, okay, if you and your
wife have a hundred kids, they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be short and tall and fat and wide and
skinny and smart and stupid, and we've got
[SPEAKER_01]: to find the LeBron James of your kids,
and that's what phenohunting is,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that can take eight months or 12
months or 16 months, depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: lucky you are, and so I think there's a
tremendous amount of value that us as
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic providers add that sometimes is a
hard learned lesson for newly created
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and C-suites that aren't as much
educated on that process, and with that
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility, and with the price that,
you know, is demanded needs to come proper
[SPEAKER_01]: testing, so I mean, tissue culture is just
the start, there's a lot of other stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that needs to be done and provided,
whether you're doing nodal tissue culture
[SPEAKER_01]: or meristem tissue culture, you know,
you need to educate yourself on that
[SPEAKER_01]: process, and you know, where it's coming
from and all the tests you need,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hot blatant is what's on the tip
of everyone's tongue, but there's tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: mosaic, there's a list of other,
a lettuce chlorosis, there's a list of
[SPEAKER_01]: other tests that need to be performed to
really feel confident in the genetics that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're bringing into your facility,
and even when you have all those things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to have a quarantine program in
place before those genetics go into
[SPEAKER_01]: commercialization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to elaborate a little bit on what
Marcus was saying about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: good genetics and growers, a lot of times
the growers in these companies get a very
[SPEAKER_02]: bad rep because they have a bad genetic,
and a good grower, you know, can be
[SPEAKER_02]: brought down by a terrible genetic,
just like a terrible grower can be brought
[SPEAKER_02]: up by a good genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that's important is that a
lot of people think that you can just get
[SPEAKER_02]: a genetic and start growing and it's gonna
be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned over time that it takes
roughly eight turns of any single genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to have a good understanding of
that plant and how it's gonna express
[SPEAKER_02]: itself and what it likes, what it doesn't
like, what temperatures you can take it
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot more to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I think it's somewhat
disappointing that the industry has such a
[SPEAKER_02]: low value for genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all believe that, you know,
they should be able to pay next to nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: for them, yet genetics are what these
companies are making their money off of.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they don't have good genetics that
produce good quality flower, how can you
[SPEAKER_02]: expect to sell it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, you know, to pick up on that,
yeah, I mean, you know, I have a slide,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know, Microsoft invests,
you know, 10 to 12%, 15% on R&D.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when I talk to big LPs and,
you know, I sit them down, I'm saying
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you guys need to invest two and a
half to five percent of your revenue on
[SPEAKER_04]: your innovation, on your plants,
on your genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you want to run your own programs,
do your own feminizing, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: do it in-house, have a good guy,
you know, has a good background,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, there's a lot of people that are
doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you want to, you know,
go to the market, pick the latest Cali
[SPEAKER_04]: hype strains, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, to focus markers on tissue
culture, the reason why cannabis hasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: turned into bananas and everything else,
it's actually quite easy to maintain
[SPEAKER_04]: mothers if you know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the disease element is there,
yes, biobanking has an advantage,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if you try and send a thousand TC cuts
across the border at the moment,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we send fresh cuttings.
[SPEAKER_04]: We put fresh cuttings in a bag and we send
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's worked great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, the history of tissue
culture is trying to fit a triangle into a
[SPEAKER_04]: square, and you know, cannabis is very
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the reasons why we don't use tissue
culture is, you know, banana and durian
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot of other bamboo propagation is a
lot harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, these plants root in six to ten
days, and they're pretty bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, hoplates and viroids and
some of these stuff, I know guys that put
[SPEAKER_04]: that into their TC room because that's
such a mess on its own.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just because you have TC doesn't mean,
you know, you're going to avoid diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more about your baker, who does it,
how they do it, and you know, your
[SPEAKER_04]: formulations between different strains
and, you know, all of that kind of jazz.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, after coming out of about a hundred
years of cannabis prohibition and all
[SPEAKER_05]: living under the mentality of how much can
I get and how fast can I get it,
[SPEAKER_05]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering times and vegetative growth,
how much does it affect you guys in your
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding of your genetics now that people
seem to be more understanding and
[SPEAKER_05]: interested in the production of
cannabinoids and volatile organic
[SPEAKER_05]: compounds, which don't necessarily
correlate to vegetative yields finishing
[SPEAKER_05]: in seven to eight weeks?
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't understand the question?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, if you want to look at some
companies, you can value their output by
[SPEAKER_04]: pure cannabinoid output, so rather than
biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, to start there, you know, as we know,
extraction plants have slightly more open
[SPEAKER_04]: profiles, you know, your oil per kilo
ratio, you know, your value chain is to
[SPEAKER_04]: your extractor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you draw extraction strains,
you add a value chain to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you grow dry flower strains,
then that's that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at your whole plant as a total
cannabinoid output and you value that as
[SPEAKER_04]: pre-roll trim, dry flower, and you take
that type of strategy, then you start to
[SPEAKER_04]: understand and don't do what, you know,
and I lived in Canada for the last few
[SPEAKER_04]: years, don't do what the Canadians do,
which is, oh, yeah, we're just going to
[SPEAKER_04]: make a hash line from the trim of the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, that's... Not this
Canadian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we all know the first hash products
that came out weren't built for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, hash plants actually don't
do well indoors because of their
[SPEAKER_04]: leaf-to-bud ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, so you're going to see
different environments and different
[SPEAKER_04]: markets being operated for different
segments because it's clearly,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and we're building good auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, California, who hated feminized
seeds, who hated auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, now they're making a lot of auto
flowers, field extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some of the Emerald Cup winners
are now being turned into auto flowers out
[SPEAKER_04]: here, and, you know, people are trying to
run these, so you're trying to get an acre
[SPEAKER_04]: of, you know, cannabinoid output.
[SPEAKER_04]: So calculate your stuff, not on biomass,
because that's not really where you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to win.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to win on quality
cannabinoids or volatiles, depending on
[SPEAKER_04]: the market you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: So put that into your business plans,
figure that out, and that works a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: better, I think, you know, getting you
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your customer, like,
I mean, at least for us, the customer's
[SPEAKER_00]: desire and outcome is really, you know,
kind of where we start the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly, you know, I don't know
how many times today I got asked if we
[SPEAKER_00]: have high THC strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's obviously the first and foremost
on anybody's mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we try to look after our
customer and their goal for what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of our customers right now are
selling dry flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, sometimes that's where
it ends up for extraction, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times it's, you know, this is what they're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yield and potency is still,
you know, it's on the front of everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: mind right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: High THC opens the door, whether you move
the conversation forward or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can really, dependent on the
company's structure and how they make
[SPEAKER_01]: their decisions, the overall yield,
the flower time, and the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: volatile organic compounds all play a role
in a different order for different
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a situation that we're
facing right now where the uneducated and
[SPEAKER_01]: uninitiated want to assign a value to a
percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's how they're able to
achieve sales volumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how they're able to communicate
value to the end sellers and users.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even though most of us up here have
had 18% cannabis that has far outdone any
[SPEAKER_01]: 35% cannabis that we've smoked,
that's not the reality right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having a threshold of a THC-A
number that is going to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can start looking at,
okay, well, this one finishes in eight
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks and this one finishes in six,
but the six-weeker doesn't yield as much
[SPEAKER_01]: grams per square foot as the eight-weeker
and is a little bit less powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're dealing with powdery mildew in
our facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to weigh all these variables
and work with your cultivators and your
[SPEAKER_01]: clients to find the right fit for that
genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really think that cannabinoids opens
the door to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a full stopper start.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't go, okay, I've got something
that finishes in six weeks, yields great
[SPEAKER_01]: per square foot, but it's only 18%.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to say, we don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be the greatest thing since
sliced bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you get over that 25%,
26% threshold, then other characteristics
[SPEAKER_01]: and factors start being put in play.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to go back on the whole THC thing,
it's something that I don't think we talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a real misnomer that we use
THC as the barometer for quality in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to equate THC in the same way
that they do with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is with a bottle of alcohol,
if it says it's 40%, it is from the top to
[SPEAKER_02]: the very bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have that with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have 1,000 plants with 30,
40 colas on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not all going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's unfortunate that this industry
has been so pigeonholed in how we present
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to the customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the days when we were doing it and we
were doing packs, you basically opened up
[SPEAKER_02]: a bag, you liked how it looked,
you liked how it smelled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the reason why you bought it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, the consumers, all they have is a
number to go by.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's terrible way to represent
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it leads me to our last question,
because I believe we are close to the end,
[SPEAKER_05]: Engail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another four or five minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this will be a perfect question for you
guys, each of you to answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: In your perfect world, in your utopian
cannabis breeding world, how does the
[SPEAKER_05]: future look?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the future looks really good
because we are making some really big
[SPEAKER_02]: steps in cannabis breeding with the
science base that we have now and the
[SPEAKER_02]: legacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ways that we did things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting to come together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that in future, we're going to
be able to develop genetics that are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to target certain cannabinoids
and certain profiles even better than we
[SPEAKER_02]: do today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's a bright future on the
genetic side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's good and bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's a bright future and a
lot of exciting things with genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: still yet to be discovered and explored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of an old bean head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been collecting seeds for a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the old stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with new countries coming online,
if we're pulling out of genetic banks from
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, the population that we get to pull
from is going to get smaller and smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be breeding projects that
expand on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there will be stuff that's truly lost
and I guess a bit of a preservationist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, land race preservation and stuff
that's just old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Thailand has gone through
legalization right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Cali genetics are over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's an impact to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be cross breeding that's
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pure Thai land races, that genetic
bubble has now been penetrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there will be less things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I guess that's a little bit
sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the future is definitely
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marker assisted breeding towards going
after a certain potency or a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid or terpene value effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that's very exciting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess the old bean head in me is
still like, I'd like to pop some old
[SPEAKER_00]: Durban poison and see what we find.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It started optimistic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It went medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if I could go downhill.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel on the future of cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could say half of us might not be here
in three to five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'll touch on Dave's optimism.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so cool at my age, 46, to come in and
have all these tools and to be able to go
[SPEAKER_04]: back into my old seed bank and open it up,
pull it out, turn it left, right,
[SPEAKER_04]: center, get support, have stuff that I'm
not worried about the door getting knocked
[SPEAKER_04]: down and losing that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, if you collect winning race horses,
you should be able to hold onto them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We never had that privilege.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the future is going to split like
the artisan corporate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's inevitable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think DNA fingerprinting and all
these things are going to give the small
[SPEAKER_04]: guy a little bit more tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the pressure will be on
maintaining facilities, maintaining
[SPEAKER_04]: biobanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think good relationships, exclusive
relationships will become stronger as
[SPEAKER_04]: things close down, as the market matures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be more science and
less art.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you take all the colors of the
rainbow and mix them together,
[SPEAKER_01]: you end up with brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dealing with a lot of just Paulies
on Paulies on Paulies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the names are the only things that
differentiate these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you open up a large enough
population, you're going to find
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that you were looking for in
your other packs in one pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that, unfortunately,
like Dave said, the bubble has been
[SPEAKER_01]: popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spent a lot of time in the Caribbean,
and you can see auto flowers, and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see wide leaf different expressions that
have been brought into the country to help
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis population.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, it's heard it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that as we move to a more
scientific and cannabinoid value-based
[SPEAKER_01]: world, we're moving away from the magic of
selecting based off experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think that that's sad,
but I think it's the reality that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: heading towards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until there's going to be some type of
renaissance that we saw in alcohol,
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar to 100 years of six different
beers in Canada, those were what you had
[SPEAKER_01]: to pick from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually, there's this
renaissance of beautiful craft beers
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when individuals like guys on
this panel who've been holding onto beans
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time are able to bring them
forward and find value in a market that
[SPEAKER_01]: currently doesn't denote value for those
quality markers and characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's going to get dark,
and then it might get a little light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have a utopian view of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way I see it is once the
regulatory... Once we have to stop
[SPEAKER_05]: promoting the lie that is you need to
protect children from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: once the regulatory dissipates and is
removed massively, I look forward to
[SPEAKER_05]: personally, because for me, genetics are
nothing without the Appalachia and the
[SPEAKER_05]: terroir to allow those genetics to express
themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I look forward to the day where I can
purchase Lebanese hash in Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: I say that all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to taste the Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can buy French wine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could buy Australian wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'd pay a lot of money for it,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd pay a lot of money for it,
wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would pay a lot of money if I could get
some Afghani hash in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'd give you 100 euro right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We may find that there are Appalachians
and terroirs that we have never tasted
[SPEAKER_05]: because they were so prohibited.
[SPEAKER_05]: They weren't Afghanistan or Morocco or
Himachal Pradesh, Parvati Valley,
[SPEAKER_05]: Nepal, all of these hash producing
countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: There may be countries that come up and
surprise us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you say things are lost,
things can also be found.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to end it on that note.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a way to end the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
