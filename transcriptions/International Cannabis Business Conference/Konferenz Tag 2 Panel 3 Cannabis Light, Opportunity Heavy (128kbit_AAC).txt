[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Nick Easley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm CEO of 3C Consulting Multiverse
Capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you look familiar, a lot of new
faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to know though that we're going
to get into is that half of you won't be
[SPEAKER_00]: here next year and there's going to be
four more, four times more people here,
[SPEAKER_00]: all with the same hopes and dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like learn from what I'm about to
share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep doing what you're doing, but like
things are hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only going to get harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, cannabis light,
plan B, you know, what's happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really exciting, kind of sucks though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, where are the actual
opportunities in Germany, in Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then still globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause everything kind of sucks if you've
been following the news.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, welcome to the party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, little disclaimer, I look like a
lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I talk like one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure to use good lawyers in this
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good CPAs without them, you will be
screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even with them, you're kind of screwed
sometimes and no matter what they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they always get paid, win or lose,
but like without good legal interpretation
[SPEAKER_00]: or tax understanding of like how things
work between countries for where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get like the best deductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you will, even if you have the best
business in the world, if you don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: plan it correctly or do the tax side
correctly, legally, you're just screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, don't even do business.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think you can do it without good
lawyers and tax accountants, unless you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to like sell lemonade outside your
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I might be offensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do swear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do make fun of things, but I'm not
guessing this is literally the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you fight the truth, you lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, been in the space for 16 years,
um, originally from Wisconsin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was in the military, um, disabled vet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I actually got into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went to Colorado 16 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right place, right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical had just happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the first state that allowed like
commercial medical production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were also the first state that allowed
commercial recreational adult use 21 and
[SPEAKER_00]: older production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We beat California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We beat Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: We beat everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the guinea pigs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like right place, right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really just saw when it went from like
caregivers, kind of like your club thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to happen here where it's
like, you know, you can grow certain
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for people and like kind of sell
them, but not make money to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you can have a GMBH or an LLC,
a corporation that actually like makes
[SPEAKER_00]: profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started working in Colorado, other States,
other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then by 2015, first German tender here,
second German tender and all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like what we've learned from all these
markets is very indicative of what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see continuing to evolve here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I finished my slides five minutes before
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like it's going to be really fun what
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, like, what's the current
status of the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I made the joke the other day,
like everything's just great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, there's no need to even have a
conversation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like good job everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the worst that it's ever been ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, what do we need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of made like jokes, like
everything's kind of on fire, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of people you're talking here
are like really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing awesome business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things are doing crushing revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Main thing we got to remember though is
like we are still getting medicine to
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, which is the most important
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been the bedrock of our foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is like a benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the adult use side hemp, legalized
hemp, that only came from legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started that in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even get hemp until 2014 back in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just keeps getting re
clarified and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like right now, if you want to survive
this, like we have to get to work bitch is
[SPEAKER_00]: if you know the Britney Spears song,
you should, you should watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I mentioned this last year
as well, like in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're like the fifth largest commodity
already cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even federally illegal in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about globally,
like it's only going to be a matter of
[SPEAKER_00]: time until cannabis again is the largest
agricultural commodity in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not just talking about like
medical cannabis and recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, CBD flowers and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about like the clothes we
wear, the protein sources that like make
[SPEAKER_00]: our bodies, how we print ink, how we wipe
our asses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like 8 billion of us now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be 16 billion of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't keep doing cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't keep doing timber.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't keep doing the same shit
different day and expect different
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this plant used to like keep us
alive, sail around the world with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: print our money on it, write our
constitutions on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case doesn't really have that much
merit anymore, but you know, so no matter
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do, just know like this is
something that's been illegal for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time and only actually in a short time of
our human history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we're taking the power back,
which is a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we think about global medical
cannabis, like what are we looking at in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2023?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same shit, different day.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the biggest like problem that we
have as a medical cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: globally is that doctors are terrified
about writing a prescription for something
[SPEAKER_00]: they were told was always a narcotic or
like the devil's lettuce or like addictive
[SPEAKER_00]: or the same as heroin or cocaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like doctors are not stoked on writing
prescriptions for heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mean, maybe in America,
if it's fentanyl or other drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But geez, like how do we educate doctors?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we continue to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's going to be more clinical trials
and it's not going to happen anytime fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like one of the things you got to know,
if you're in medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to be as fast as you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to go from selling a
hundred kilos this month to like 20,000
[SPEAKER_00]: kilos and have your 20,000 hectare farm
and be like a fucking dole of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had those thoughts in 2015,
16, 17, 18, and then they started to
[SPEAKER_00]: fizzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like now it's just like a reality
where I've been a part of a company that
[SPEAKER_00]: went from like one employee to 250 and now
it's got 10 employees, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: large farm in Columbia, similar to a lot
of producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we think about like,
this is one of the most important things
[SPEAKER_00]: that happened that still no one talks
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still am like, this is so critical y
'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember during coronavirus, like we
rescheduled cannabis at the UN level with
[SPEAKER_00]: the WHO, the commission for narcotic
drugs, like the CND.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like cannabis is not like scheduled one
in their opinion anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just needs more evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember like we're, well,
most of us are members like the UN and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, if they agree on something,
we're going to do it kind of like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to in the European commission,
unless you're Germany or Hungary,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the time, you know, oddly enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most countries are not in compliance
with UN law anymore, where it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're supposed to amend their controlled
substances act to match what the UN,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the WHO, what the CND said.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of countries are in compliance,
more and more are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, if we change that, those tax
crazy shits about America, like IRC2EDE,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those things go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just know like internationally cannabis
is medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most countries are just choosing not to
like believe that yet or adopt that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they will just a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think globally, like what's
happening with like recreational adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Uruguay, where's Uruguay again?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, small little country,
the first country to have the courage,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the tenacity to like actually
legalize and go like this to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada followed suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have like the Netherlands with the
weed experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the social clubs that are going
to be happening here ish TBD, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: like how that that worked when we get into
plan B, you've got like the medical clubs
[SPEAKER_00]: in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, other than Malta, Luxembourg
asked of two days ago with their vote,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we're going to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Canada and Uruguay, they're the
only places doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, the United States,
those blue things, I'm going to make a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of parallels between the United States and
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that that's not really fun for
most Europeans, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, like we left here because shit
sucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went and did some crazy shit,
learned from us, take that back this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the switcheroo getting a
little retro here, but this is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been saying federally in the
United States is going to be five to 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years until we have legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been saying that for like more
than five to 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even someone who's been around this
long, like a dinosaur fuck, it's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen as fast as we think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that don't want it to
happen, the longer this goes, the more of
[SPEAKER_00]: us bleed, the more they devalue us,
the easier it's going to be for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: acquire us, which is going to happen
eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just know it's like, it's going to
suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to entrench.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be like a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be like taking over
France.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, it's going to take a
long time to know France, France.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make fun of France a little
bit too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So United States, fuck and cowboys boom,
boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yesterday someone was really
funny, like you cowboys always come over
[SPEAKER_00]: here and like, yeah, we are kind of
cowboys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit is a little crazy, but this is one
cowboy that's like still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we've learned in the United
States, I'm telling you is going to be so
[SPEAKER_00]: indicative of what's happening here
because it's already started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like here future, you know,
here's some future thoughts for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in America, just remember we've got
almost 350 million people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did almost $37 billion US in revenue
last year as an industry and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our whole country, like assets been
like changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember Texas has medical now,
but each state is its own little country.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I want you to like
remember, even though like we've got cross
[SPEAKER_00]: border and like one government and like
states do have certain little rights
[SPEAKER_00]: compared just like countries in the
European union.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got little rights, not really,
but kind of, but when you can flex those
[SPEAKER_00]: rights, that's when shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when amazing things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's when we can undo on justices.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we can start new industries
and policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we can actually like
illuminate that there was a problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: something that the federal government or
the European commission in this context,
[SPEAKER_00]: like do you have a joke for like uncle Sam
of like the European commission or
[SPEAKER_00]: something?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you had like some figure we could
make fun of, but like our uncle Sam
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to your uncle Sam or like aunt
Patty or whoever, you know, she is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like each state has been like choosing
to break federal law and write their own
policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is our government,
like our FDA, food and drug
[SPEAKER_00]: administration, or our USDA, like
department of agriculture, they can't tell
[SPEAKER_00]: states how to regulate this or how to like
deal with pesticides or testing or like
[SPEAKER_00]: potency or quality control because it's
federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still in America, we're schedule one,
narcotic heroin, no medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't study it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the rest of the world's like,
Hey, it's changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, big up to date here,
there's only one only three states that
[SPEAKER_00]: still don't have some sort of cannabis
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's 50 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 21 now that have adult use like
legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And DC like in Washington, DC,
our capital, which is not a state or
[SPEAKER_00]: district.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's recreationally legal there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like as this is happening, just like
it's happening here with Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: with Malta, with Luxembourg, yeah,
Czech Republic, the pilot program that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every little country is like, Hmm,
how are we going to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all going to do it different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all going to fuck it up in a
different way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be successes in some
failures and other parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could go a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at what's been working in the
United States, what products work,
[SPEAKER_00]: what concentrations work, what tax rates
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you overtax this, the illicit market
just continues to take market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you make it like too cheap,
the illicit market is going to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give way too many licenses,
free market, tons of businesses die.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only give like one or two licenses,
it's a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just think like from this map,
we started in Colorado as the first green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just spreading around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more and more initiatives
happening, but we're not going to legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: anytime soon in America either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though like there was some like leak
news, like Biden's going to de-schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, who knows what's going to happen
politically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're into Europe, your world here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been pretty interesting to watch like
having worked over here for now eight
[SPEAKER_00]: years and seeing like what's happened with
the bee farm with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany is amazing and how like they've
allowed medical cannabis, but then seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: how Portugal came in, how Spain's doing
with their clubs, how the Netherlands with
[SPEAKER_00]: their weed experiment happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at the same time having bedrock can
like one of the like the first highest
[SPEAKER_00]: quality like EU GMP producers ever that
didn't scale and like take over the world
[SPEAKER_00]: like we thought, because the Canadians on
the other side legalized first and they
[SPEAKER_00]: thought they would dominate and take over
Europe, which obviously didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we think about this little area
here, this will be the largest cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: market in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's based on your population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when we look at like drinking
correlations with other things,
[SPEAKER_00]: disposable income levels, like eventually
like preferences will change, things are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to happen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not been good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one of the big news from yesterday,
you know, Canopy that came over that spent
[SPEAKER_00]: like what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 90 plus million in Spain trying to
get their medical license and like all
[SPEAKER_00]: these acquisitions and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canopy growth at one point was had a 19
billion dollar market cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, it just went under 400 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, there's a big difference
between a billion and a million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when you're like 78% down for the
year and when your stock or your market
[SPEAKER_00]: cap is 2.1% of what it was in 2021,
what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think that's going to be like
for y'all over here and your public
[SPEAKER_00]: company stocks and like this company is
going public on like the Tel Aviv
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange, this one on the Frankfurt,
this one in London.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that working for everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not super great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we think about this, just think
like it's America, but not America,
[SPEAKER_00]: but America, but not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot more rights as countries,
you know, than we do as states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just thinking like Luxembourg,
Germany, Czech, I mean, Schengen with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Swiss, like it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got sanctioned production happening
in the Netherlands through the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment, which I love how in Europe you
can actually it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can say some sort of word and then
everything's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's not the weed like
legalization project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's the weed experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not legalizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to give licenses and allow
people to reduce cannabis and sell it to
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone who's 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: 21 or older.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like legalization to me,
but it's an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like Putin can be like, it's not a war.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a military exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm just, you know, bad,
bad joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter where you are here,
think like, as soon as a couple of these
[SPEAKER_00]: countries start to fall and like change
their positions, it's going to be a matter
[SPEAKER_00]: of time until they all do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not everyone's going to come on quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you've got Indiana's, like who's the
biggest asshole in Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't, I don't actually know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like there's going to be like a couple
of holdouts and there's going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that are slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's going to be some that don't
want to have production and only want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: How that's all going to play out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know, but it will be very,
very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't cross borders.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do what you want in your own
little house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be similar to Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did Curaleaf take like a preemptive
position to purchase one of the three
[SPEAKER_00]: medical domestic producers in Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they didn't spend that 20
million euros yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 19.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, Hey, if we want to,
we can execute this option because most
[SPEAKER_00]: likely domestic production is going to be
required for when domestic supply happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to do it with these
social club things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I got my three plants a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people can grow 500 for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1500 plants ain't shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can, I can grow like a 10 kilo
plant in Columbia or somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're cycling through a lot of
plants, which still that leak law said
[SPEAKER_00]: three plants per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not that, I mean, that's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like unless you grow really, really big
plants, you know, most people are,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not even enough cannabis to smoke
in a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, plan B program, like kind of
seems like a failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Germany was really excited and got
everyone excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you get in power when you say you're
going to like do some shit and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to deliver on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess politicians do that sometimes just
like, you know, it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now like when the rubber meets the
road, like the tire is like moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, how is Germany actually going
to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that leaked draft doesn't look
that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some things that could change
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But realistically there is not much
business opportunity for when you read
[SPEAKER_00]: what plan B is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've got the clubs, there's
going to be the real estate for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest opportunity, which I've
mentioned already is like the home grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: like who's going to sell lights,
who's going to sell soil, who's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell fertilizer and nutrients to like
everyone who thinks I'm going to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: these three plants at home and like in my
garden or like where there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: some like big uptake and like those kinds
of sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, there's really not a commercial
viable opportunity right now based on like
[SPEAKER_00]: what we see for the leak draft,
which sucks for y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I made definitely a joke about
this the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan B is like a birth control pill in
America for it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the condom breaks or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of like what plan B is to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, we were going to do
something cool, but like it didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just do this to like hope for the
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like realistically, plan B for no
matter how you read it, I don't see an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity other than these clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now through that opportunity, though,
those clubs could start to make brands
[SPEAKER_00]: that could get like consumer reputations
known.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bummer too, you're going to be a
member of one club.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be a member of another club.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, it was so radical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like originally our medical, you would go
to one dispensary and make them your
[SPEAKER_00]: caregiver for while you were there and
assign your six plants to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you could go to another store and
do the same thing the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just kept making more plants by
like people going to more stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would still be their care provider,
even though they came in one time four
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still would grow their six plants for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's going to be really weird
what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like brands, consumer reputation,
the tech software, there's like the deal
[SPEAKER_00]: between those clubs and deal with their
compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see some opportunities with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But realistically, for like mass market,
like 37, 40 billion revenue, like what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing in the US illegally,
not going to happen here as quickly as
[SPEAKER_00]: most people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some big changes happened, though,
in the last couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Luxembourg, Baller, voted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been talking about it for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to what is it,
like four plants or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: one more than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One plant, it really isn't that much
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, like one plant can change the
world, like this one's about to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Luxembourg's got the courage to kind of
come forward, even in this last couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is almost like my joke with this one
is just unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like doing this to like help
alleviate like war trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you're still in the fucking war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, don't get everybody stoned yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, keep fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I understand, you know,
but this is a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember going to Ukraine before the
war, really focused on some like big HEM
[SPEAKER_00]: projects and thinking about like what that
country could do and like just seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural production, the costs,
and then all this bullshit's happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is still happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then to like come out and say like,
hey, we're going to legalize medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you actually read through what he
had said, he's sanctioning and going to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow like domestic medical supply first,
which would then allow export if you do it
[SPEAKER_00]: compliantly with law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they make it as part of the EU,
you know, and win the war, like that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be a really big thing because what you
produce there, 12 hours away by semi,
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 euros to get something here and a cost
like who won, like how much is a hectare
[SPEAKER_00]: of land to lease in Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what, like 600 euros?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 20 euros there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like Ukraine is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why everyone's like likes
it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The climate and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was talking about your stocks as
well, like this was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not that long ago, they're all worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about 30% worse than they were
even from when I screenshotted that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, don't just go public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just think that you can do the same
thing that everyone else has done because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be very similar to like
what's happened with everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that you had one more France
joke too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So meanwhile, Luxembourg is going to allow
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: France now allows you to pay your taxes or
you like, you're fine instantly like to
[SPEAKER_00]: bribe like a police officer, AKA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like every country is going to do
something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to decriminalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are going to allow a little
production in some clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some like Malta, Malta might actually just
do like a large production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let some of their medical switch over to
the adult use side, which is a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of the time what happened in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we had a medical state go to a
recreational state or an adult use,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first people who get to like switch
over are the current license holders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you think Cureleaf bought that
position in Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like a hundred percent of the
time on the other side of the pond it
[SPEAKER_00]: happened probably going to be the same
thing here where they're going to give new
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses to like new producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's possible too, because you got
insurance paying for one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's so much unknown with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where there's the opportunity,
which we're about to just dive into in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last couple of moments here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that I do love about America
that I've learned is like real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had been into real estate 15 years
ago, I'd literally be the richest person
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single time you have cultivation,
manufacturing, retail, delivery,
[SPEAKER_00]: there has to be a property involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: That property typically can't be bank
owned, has to be owned outright.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have the consent of the owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically has to be zoned something very
specific based on whatever that burger
[SPEAKER_00]: meister or like local position decided it
should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically can't be too close to a church
or a daycare or an addiction center or
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call this green zone real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Europe starts to unfold,
just like they did in the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_00]: like with the weed experiment,
like where you position those 10
[SPEAKER_00]: operators, which was a fucking lottery and
a joke, but like there was big constraints
[SPEAKER_00]: on real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where are they going to allow the
sales?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it'll be at the pharmacies owned by
like all these different families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it'll be at different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where will clubs be allowed?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to just let them be like
next to parks and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, this is Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are a little bit more strict than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though you can walk down the
street from the beer or in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: like after 8 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: at night, you can like walk down the
sidewalk smoking a joint now, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: after seven in the morning to eight at
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, you know, set your timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But real estate will be one of the biggest
things that you can actually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be like over a five,
10 year play.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically for real estate,
we get three to six times the returns that
[SPEAKER_00]: we do on any normal real estate deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I still get 12 to 18 percent debt for
real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because banks can't finance it,
it's going to be very similar here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Large scale institutions are not going to
be stoked to give big old loans to like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis companies or like social clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give them a business loan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where there's going to be some big
opportunities for investors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to raise money in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we're federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one wants to invest into Pablo Escobar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're like the big guy,
like we're not Pablo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard as hell to raise money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just know that like in these processes,
if you're an investor or an operator,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to start looking for like where
my capital is going to be safe and who's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to manage it well or how to actually
get real capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And debt is by far like so much easier
than equity, especially when it's asset
[SPEAKER_00]: backed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going to think the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned this every single time I talk
is this has been a 10 year thing and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: only been right about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't see it just like spiking back
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bubble's already happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bubble's already happened here in
Europe, too, for stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If Germany had come out with a plan A of
like a massive we're going to give 50
[SPEAKER_00]: production licenses and 50 manufacturing
licenses and we're going to give 2000
[SPEAKER_00]: retail licenses based on population and
all these burgers or like little towns,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that could have been cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not how it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like that bubble is not going to happen
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, whenever these big news,
the bubble was from like 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: It popped so bad in 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll never recover like worse than like
the tax side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember that was, you know,
originally here's our five year plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see those original bubbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm even 3% lower than I was two days
ago at the GIF, which just is like not a P
[SPEAKER_00]: value, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's got not 5%, but like 3%
more in like three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like public is not the way to like
raise capital right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're not going to take over Europe
and like raise this big thing and oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be like the next canopy
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not even cool to say anymore
because remember, they're only 2.1% the
[SPEAKER_00]: value that they originally were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like don't compare yourself like we're
going to be like them, like a failure,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need money, if you're an
operator, if you're an ancillary company,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a packaging company,
if you're a producer in Portugal,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're like anything, I guarantee you,
you, well, other than maybe 5,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% of you, you don't have enough money to
survive the next two to three years
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not going to be as awesome as
you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how are you going to survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to downsize?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to get efficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to start to prepare your
financial models to get capital?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like because as soon as you see like
the light, like, oh shoot, we only got
[SPEAKER_00]: cashflow for three months, you're fucking
dead already as a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like thousands of clients, like they come
to us desperate, like they'll get merchant
[SPEAKER_00]: cash advance loans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll like do personal guarantees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they'll take out a second mortgage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already screwed if you're doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so you've got to plan your business
farther in the future than you could
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone always thinks like we're going to
build this brand and everyone's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course it's going to have Kana in
the name or 420 or something stupid as
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like pharma can just come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so if you're going to build a brand,
just stay away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've learned in America, it's
companies that don't have anything to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis or anything green as part of
it that are actually like brands that
[SPEAKER_00]: people like, or that we've had like
massive exits on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've built a company from one thing
to like 19 locations and sold it to
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay-Z's public company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's name had nothing to do with cannabis
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, those are the ones that are
really recognizable or like to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little creative, but like don't just think
like it's all about the brand either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if your product sucks, your brand
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's going to rebuy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spend a million dollars on a logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like spend your time like unlike legal
protections, IP, knowing that like
[SPEAKER_00]: litigation is going to be so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bigger you get, the more bullshit
you'll have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staff are going to steal from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clients are going to steal from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's going to be more and more
lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: People aren't going to pay you like
litigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another big thing for like
investors right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where to focus like litigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are carcasses and dead companies all
over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've been buying things from Canada,
importing them into America, not cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like lights, greenhouse equipment,
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, you've got a clever
leaves, all these other companies in
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal, other places like de-stressed
assets are fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get BD in that, like get, get deep into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where there's opportunities,
even though it seems weird, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: cannibalize things that were failures and
actually put them towards opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where distressed assets for
investors now, so much opportunity in
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, what's the wisdom of like,
don't do what everyone did in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it like the failures did in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything like they did in Canada
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, legalizing first is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalized medical is good, but like that's
where the opportunities are.
[SPEAKER_00]: World's changing hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously on my Grand Canyon pictures,
like we've got heat pressure, we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: all these shifting changes, new things
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't evolve, you're dead
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like that business plan of yours,
like if you, every single person in here
[SPEAKER_00]: who owns a business or works in one,
if you ask yourself or your owner,
[SPEAKER_00]: like what's the business plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's our five year plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't know it, start looking for
another job.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know it, fix your fucking
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start thinking hard in the future or like
you're not gonna have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you can't see like what's,
like it's always like, oh I gotta survive
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's gonna happen next week?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's next month?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you gotta take that moment as a
leader or an investor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like, what is this thing gonna be in
five years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it worth anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it not?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's changing so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most startups, most companies are gonna
fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be like everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't like fight everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like your collaborators, everyone
that's here, everyone that's at this
[SPEAKER_00]: conference, don't be a dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to people, get to know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going through the same things as
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might even have a solution to your
problem and you're like, oh they're a
[SPEAKER_00]: competitor and I'm like too cool to talk
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're in this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lifelong mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have so much time because like
I've been doing this for a long time and
[SPEAKER_00]: the things I would have done differently
compared to like what we could do
[SPEAKER_00]: differently, like we have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like how are you gonna look at this in
the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some of these lessons from like what
this was because realistically,
[SPEAKER_00]: we only have so much time and time's now.
Peace.
Thank you.
