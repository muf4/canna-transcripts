[SPEAKER_01]: We're very proud and excited to present
here to discuss medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the partner at Dittens and he's the
head of the European Cannabis Group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please welcome Peter Humber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for this kind
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladies and gentlemen, after lunch on a
Friday the 13th, it's always difficult,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a lucky day or it can be a
difficult day.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me it's a lucky day because I have the
pleasure to speak for such a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: audience here about the medical cannabis
developments in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming back to difficult, I don't know
whether you have listened recently to
[SPEAKER_00]: German politicians because they are using
the word difficult very often,
[SPEAKER_00]: also in the connection with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look into what they really mean,
what difficult means, it looks like it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: synonym for either unacceptable,
out of question, or outrageously stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If ever a politician is used difficult,
you have to really look what he is
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having said that, I would like to make a
couple of remarks before I start my
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation about our discussion which we
had earlier today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was from one of the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say use the other
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: This one might be easier for us to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a little... This is a little
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear me better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think somebody asked of you should
Slovenia copy the German model?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is that would be difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to differentiate between the
recreational part, of course, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recreational part, and thank you very
much, my dear friend, that you left the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical part for me this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recreational part, which you so nicely
outlined today, is a step forward,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not what actually everybody wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will come back to that in a minute,
but with respect to the medical part,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, from my point of view, a good model
to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next 30 minutes, I'm going to show
you a little bit why it is a good model to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at, even for Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a number of advantages,
and I would say it is really a success
[SPEAKER_00]: story since we started with the
legalization of medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany back in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part, the recreation part,
the recreational, you know, as I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not copy it in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides the fact, me as a lawyer,
I would never advise on copying something,
[SPEAKER_00]: not even the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be like I would actually
recommend copying the German Employees
[SPEAKER_00]: Invention Act, which is the most elaborate
and most difficult act regarding this
[SPEAKER_00]: topic to a Japanese employer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at it, having a look at the
advantages, and of course then use them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Slovenia is now on the move into the
medical cannabis market, into the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be worthwhile to consider what
Germany has done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the outline what I would like to
discuss with you this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, a very brief review.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it all happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is actually Germany so now in Europe
in the forefront of the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course we have a look what has
actually happened since 2016, what has
[SPEAKER_00]: recently happened since the legalization
of recreational or partial legalization of
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course we look into the
potential problems which this all may or
[SPEAKER_00]: may not cause in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also take into consideration that we have
elections next year, and the government
[SPEAKER_00]: may change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have looked at what has happened
in Germany, particularly just recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a likelihood that the current
coalition will not be represented in the
[SPEAKER_00]: government end of next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having said that, let's have a look
into the development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the year 2016, there was the
possibility for medical patients to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: for a special permission to use cannabis
as a medicine for the treatment of their
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those patients actually wanted to
grow at home, the home-grow model,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he got a cease and desist order from
the Bayfarm, which is the federal medical
[SPEAKER_00]: authority very much like the FDA in the
US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he went to court.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in June 2016, the matter was taken up
by the highest, in April of 2016,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the highest administrative court in
Germany, and they allowed him to cultivate
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for his treatment at home,
which for at that point in time was a
[SPEAKER_00]: nightmare for the legislator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they came up with the, respective
rules and regulations for narcotics or the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of a narcotic, meaning cannabis,
as a medicine in June 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: In March 2017, it all became legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, and that's now,
I think, the important points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, cannabis can be prescribed as
a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why has that been so outstandingly
important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, it has been defined as an
extemporaneous mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking this morning about
finished products and the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: finished products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finished products, as you know,
need, of course, a marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: authorization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for marketing authorization,
you need costly clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the consequence that if the trial
fails, you have lost a significant amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of money and, of course, also reputation
for that specific product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can only be done for a certain
indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the importance of the definition of
cannabis as an extemporaneous mixture
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot be underestimated, because as an
extemporaneous mixture, and I'll come back
[SPEAKER_00]: to that in a minute, you do not need any
kind of clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: The physician can prescribe cannabis for
the treatment of his disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patient gets a prescription,
goes to the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pharmacist is preparing the product
according to the prescription and is
[SPEAKER_00]: handing it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no need for clinical trials,
no need for marketing authorization,
[SPEAKER_00]: as cannabis in Germany is defined as an
extemporaneous mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: First important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, there is no limitation,
no official limitation, at least,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which indications?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that in the UK, as you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very limited indication for
which cannabis can be prescribed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the case in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Germany, each and every physician can
actually decide whether cannabis could be
[SPEAKER_00]: used as a treatment for the disease of
that specific patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he can select, today, out of 400
different flower products, which are on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market, in order to treat the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second very important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, this product,
the extemporaneous mixture product,
[SPEAKER_00]: does not need to be used to go through a
price-finding process with regard to the
[SPEAKER_00]: reimbursement for patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we have a very detailed health
insurance system in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody has a health insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these products, these treatments with
cannabis, are going to be reimbursed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the health insurance companies upon a
specific application by the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: together with the physicians to be
reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the years 2017 and following,
around 60 percent of these applications
[SPEAKER_00]: have been granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the health insurance companies have
reimbursed the patients for their
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we will look at that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has changed on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that may be the important points which
actually led to an increase of patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: an increase of prescriptions since 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: In April, 2024, as I just mentioned,
and Kai has outlined this very nicely
[SPEAKER_00]: today, the Kanji, the New Cannabis Act,
came into force.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, the Medical Cannabis Act,
which contains also, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: new provisions on the medical cannabis
prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will look at that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the significant changes since
2017?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are new prescription
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has Germany done with the partial
legalization for the recreational market?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we mentioned that this morning,
whether Slovenia should go in this
[SPEAKER_00]: direction as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you have mentioned it just
about this morning in your presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany has taken cannabis out of the
German Narcotics Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is not longer a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been transferred into the cannabis
law and the new cannabis law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean that you can do everything
with cannabis right now, because the same
[SPEAKER_00]: limitations which we had before with some
exceptions, which we have seen on the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational side this morning,
apply to cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot actually freely trade it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot actually sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow it at home, as we have heard
this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, these cultivation
associations are going to be established.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, hopefully, the pilot
projects, scientifically controlled pilot
[SPEAKER_00]: projects, will be established.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is important is that this
decision has an influence on the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now, physicians are not going to
prescribe a narcotic which is
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly more difficult than
prescribing just a regular RX product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that has changed since the 1st of April
this year, so very brand new, that every
[SPEAKER_00]: physician can actually now prescribe
cannabis as a regular product.
[SPEAKER_00]: A regular RX product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not longer a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this eliminates, of course,
a number of bureaucratic requirements,
[SPEAKER_00]: not only for the physicians who actually
had to register with the B-Farm to be
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to prescribe cannabis,
but also for the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they have to safeguard the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a product which has certain
requirements, but it is not longer a
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next big issue, and that has an impact
on the future businesses, which we will
[SPEAKER_00]: see as well, is that the requirement for
cultivation medical cannabis in Germany
[SPEAKER_00]: has been significantly changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may know that after 2017, the B-Farm,
the federal health agency or medical
[SPEAKER_00]: agency, has tendered out to the public the
possibility to cultivate medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in Germany, and three companies actually
finally succeeded in that long-winding
[SPEAKER_00]: process who actually were allowed to
cultivate 10.4 metric tons in four years,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means 2.6 metric tons per year plus
an additional threshold of 10%,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is compared to the actual
consumption, we will see that in a minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a fraction of what is actually needed
in the medical market.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been changed, which means every
producer who thinks he is in a position,
[SPEAKER_00]: he can actually cultivate cannabis,
can apply now to the cannabis agency to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a license for the cultivation of
medical cannabis, which of course we all
[SPEAKER_00]: know is not easy because of the quality
requirements, at least the security
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will not be loosened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those three who actually won the
tender back in 2019, if I'm not mistaken,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those three have already applied to
increase the quantity for the cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis in Germany for the medical
market and have all been granted,
[SPEAKER_00]: as of today, respective permissions to
increase significantly the production,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivation of their medical cannabis
products, which will have a significant
[SPEAKER_00]: impact on the market as well, in
particular for those exporters from
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, the Netherlands, and other
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I come back to that at the end of my
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this has a significant impact on
the medical market, as you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not only since April 1st we have a
partial recreational market.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the decisions made there had an impact
on the medical market as well to its
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have now three charts which I would like
to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is the comparison between
the estimated demand versus the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: import of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the actual figures for 2022
and 2023 are not yet available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have other data which are a little bit
more actual than these ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you can see is actually that the
respective demand, which the so-called
[SPEAKER_00]: Bundes-Opionstelle, which is actually a
department of the German Bay Farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: has actually estimated because this has to
be, and that's important also for
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia, you have to actually indicate to
apply to the INCB, the International
[SPEAKER_00]: Narcotic Control Board, for getting
permission to import cannabis for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot just order it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the government in this case,
through its respective ministry or through
[SPEAKER_00]: the respective agency, has to apply for
the importation of cannabis into the
[SPEAKER_00]: respective local market and gets it
usually granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a big hurdle, but it's a
formal process which each country who's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to import medical cannabis has to
follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here that originally the
estimation was significantly higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual imports.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 2021 it already leveled out,
and it will probably be leveled out but in
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly increased for the next
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look into that here,
now I have some more actual figures which
[SPEAKER_00]: are the imports of cannabis by quarter
from the year 2017 to 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a significant increase over the
years in kilograms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2024, in particular in the second
quarter, we have significant increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: The figures estimated for the third and
fourth quarter 2024 are even significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will show you in a minute what kind of
impact the recreational changes had on the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least, these are the
number of prescriptions within the
[SPEAKER_00]: framework of sedentary health insurances.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are only those patients'
prescriptions which are registered with
[SPEAKER_00]: their health insurance who get reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, and you will see that in a minute,
we have a much more self-payer market
[SPEAKER_00]: which has been increased over the last
couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, that is a figure which is
only looking into those patients who have
[SPEAKER_00]: actually been reimbursed by their health
insurance companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that there is a significant
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's prescriptions, not patients,
but today I think we are looking into what
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say around 100,000 patients
currently under treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a significant increase in the
number of patients under treatment with
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis in Germany, which to a
certain extent is, for all those who are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the business, a little bit
disappointing because everybody thought
[SPEAKER_00]: the market would be higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, it is by far the largest
markets in Europe with over, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say 100,000 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look into the other markets,
it's 29,000 patients for Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands, around 9,000 patients,
and Poland, 5,200.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, of course, also due to the fact
that their prescription policy is
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sales in the medical market in
Germany are actually to be expected around
[SPEAKER_00]: half a billion in 2024, which is,
I would say, already significant,
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing by estimated approximately 4%
per year, I believe, it will be probably
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That market is going to hit, I would say,
in 2029, so five years from now,
[SPEAKER_00]: from my expectations, the 1 billion euro
mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very conservatively calculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming back to the latest developments,
and we are now in September 2024,
[SPEAKER_00]: as such developments just took place
between 1st of April and now, the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis market has significantly
increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, through the facts which I
mentioned before, the change in the
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription requirements, and what has
happened actually is that shortly after
[SPEAKER_00]: the legalization of recreational cannabis,
there were IT platforms created.
[SPEAKER_00]: IT platforms which are bringing together
physicians, patients, and pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, actually, a patient can actually
book an appointment with a physician via
[SPEAKER_00]: this platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can use telemedicine for his
consultation, and is getting then an
[SPEAKER_00]: electronic prescription either directly to
the pharmacy or back to him, and then can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually get his cannabis, even without
having a physical appointment with a
[SPEAKER_00]: physician, delivered to his doorstep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look into the various different
platforms there, and we are advising five
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, there are, of course,
some means which may be at least
[SPEAKER_00]: questionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, some of them are using
physicians not in Germany, but outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany within the European Union,
for example, in Croatia, where the
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements for a telemedicinal
consultation are significantly looser in
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison to Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he doesn't even have to see the
patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just files in a questionnaire with all
his data, and is getting his prescription,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even not, but most of them are getting
the prescription, delivered to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can then actually go to the online
pharmacy, file his prescription,
[SPEAKER_00]: and gets it back to deliver to his
doorstep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have here citations of three cannabis
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are importers or distributors,
which is Canturage, Cansativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Calimedical, and you see that they
have a significant increase in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the facts and figures which you saw
on the chart will be significantly higher
[SPEAKER_00]: in the third and fourth quarter 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calimedical actually forecasts a seven to
tenfold increase in sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can say, well, are they all
patients, or do we see kind of a shift
[SPEAKER_00]: from the recreational market into the
medical market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, to make it easier
for patients to get a prescription is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been in the pharmaceutical
industry for many years, and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely one of those who supports the
use of medical cannabis as an alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine for various diseases,
for various indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we are definitely going into
the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether the prescription policy,
which is so liberal currently in Germany
[SPEAKER_00]: for the prescribing cannabis will stay in
place for the next years, I can't tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you, because the authorities are already
very much looking into these kind of IT
[SPEAKER_00]: platforms and distributions of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is all legal, because we
have respective arrangement between the
[SPEAKER_00]: European member states that, of course,
a physician in a different member state
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually prescribe cannabis for a
patient who is residing in another state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether this has been foreseen here or not
is a different question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look into what has happened
since then is that 80% of the current
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis prescriptions are self-payers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ratio was totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 60 to 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shortly after the legalization of
medicinal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's 80% are self-payers,
which is surprising or not surprising,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how you see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is also important is that the
so-called GBA, which is the Federal Joint
[SPEAKER_00]: Committee, which is the highest
self-governing body within the German
[SPEAKER_00]: health care system, will loosen the
requirements of applying to the health
[SPEAKER_00]: insurances before the treatment of his
cannabis will start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is, by the way, kind of strange,
because there is, from my point of view,
[SPEAKER_00]: no other Rx product where a patient has
actually to file an application to his
[SPEAKER_00]: health insurances to get reimbursement
first before the treatment starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be now a group of physicians,
probably those specialists, specialized
[SPEAKER_00]: groups like physicians who are specialized
in pain treatment where this actually
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement will be waived.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last but not least, despite the partial
legalization, there are currently,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we said this morning, no ways to buy
recreational cannabis freely in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, from my point of view, would be the
ultimate solution in order to fulfill the
[SPEAKER_00]: arguments for the legalization of
cannabis, which is A, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting the use, B, to deliver better
products to the recreational users,
[SPEAKER_00]: and C, to attack the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this is still on hold,
as we all know, because of the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements or the legal hurdles which
the European Commission has actually
[SPEAKER_00]: established within the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, Germany didn't want to go
to the European Court of Justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you may remember, the German government
had just big losses before the European
[SPEAKER_00]: Court of Justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was with regard to that car
fees or the respective payment for using
[SPEAKER_00]: the German Autobahn also for private cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one was with regard to the
storage of personal data for a longer
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't want to risk, again,
losing before the European Court of
[SPEAKER_00]: Justice, and as such actually went back to
that partial recreational system,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we saw this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, looking into what is going to
happen in the future, these two questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, are imminent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, will legalization lead
to patients buying cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational purposes instead of medical
cannabis, or will both industry be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: fully coexist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we saw that in Canada after this,
I would say, full legalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: where everybody can actually buy,
every adult can buy cannabis in a licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medical market went not significantly,
but went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Germany, through that system which
we have implemented for partial
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization of recreational cannabis in
1st of April, the opposite was the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obtaining recreational cannabis through
fewer bureaucratic hurdles, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: has its benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, whether this is going to be in
the future is difficult to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The approach which we heard this morning
of various European countries to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: change that policy for recreational
cannabis within the European Union is the
[SPEAKER_00]: right step of doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last but not least, will there be any
changes with regard to imports of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they decrease drastically?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer to that is, yes, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: More and more, and of course, all those
cultivators which are already present in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, more and more cultivators will be
coming up to cultivate medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany, with the consequence that the
more you domestically produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: the less you are allowed to import.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though the INCB is, of course,
monitoring not only the imports of a
[SPEAKER_00]: country, but also what the country
actually self-cultivates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you that these three
cultivators already are looking into
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly broadening their portfolio
with other plants, with other seeds which
[SPEAKER_00]: they are going to import in order to
really be competitive on that market,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the consequence that if they come to
the market, which will be in due course,
[SPEAKER_00]: then of course the import quota for
medical cannabis will be reduced,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has a significant impact,
of course, on the respective exporters
[SPEAKER_00]: from, of course, Canada, the Netherlands,
and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having said that, the situation with
regard to medical cannabis, from my point
[SPEAKER_00]: of view, is a model which I think to a
certain extent cannot be copied,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can be implemented by others.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a success story.
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect to the changes in the
recreational market, I would say they have
[SPEAKER_00]: been difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's hear it for Peter
Homburg.
Thank you.
