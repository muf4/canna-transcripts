[SPEAKER_08]: My name is David Wenger.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here with Karina Lanakoski,
John Conroy and Francis Scanlon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna introduce the panel and then
we're gonna try to cover a few areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: First we'll start with the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: regulatory situation for cannabis and then
Karina will cover the Canadian,
[SPEAKER_08]: Karina along with John will cover the
Canadian landscape and Francis will talk
[SPEAKER_08]: to Europe.
[SPEAKER_08]: First I'll introduce my fellow panelists.
[SPEAKER_08]: So starting at the end is Francis Scanlon,
the managing director and founder of
[SPEAKER_08]: Cloud9.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a Switzerland based manufacturer
and producer of compliant hemp derived
[SPEAKER_08]: chocolate products.
[SPEAKER_08]: John Conroy is QC from Vancouver deeply
involved in the Canadian cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Karina Lanakoski is a VP of quality and
regulatory for Cannabis Compliance Inc.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're a global regulatory compliance
firm that provides end to end business
[SPEAKER_08]: solutions for cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm David Wenger.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a long time investor in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I started investing in Canada in 2016 and
then in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: in 2017.
[SPEAKER_08]: My background is as a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I spent most of my career at DLA Piper in
New York.
[SPEAKER_08]: DLA Piper is a global law firm.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wrote a white paper last year called the
Green Regulatory Arbitrage, a case for
[SPEAKER_08]: investing in U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: multistate vertically integrated cannabis
companies that was read all around the
[SPEAKER_08]: world including in Congress and got me
invited and I'm part of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: Senate and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: House of Representatives cannabis working
groups.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm in D.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: twice a month working with senior
congressional staffers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm drafting and advancing federal
cannabis legislation in the United States.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're missing today Leah Hesse who is the
chief compliance officer and chief
[SPEAKER_08]: experience officer at Forefront.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's not here so I'm going to cover the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: side of things in her place.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the rest of this panel is going to be a
Q&A but we'll just start off with an
[SPEAKER_08]: overview of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: landscape first and then I'll address that
and then we'll move on to Canada and
[SPEAKER_08]: Switzerland and Europe.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the United States we are seeing
historic progress on cannabis legislation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unprecedented what is occurring on a
federal level and a state by state level.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the 115th Congress that concluded in
January there were some 60 measures to
[SPEAKER_08]: legalize cannabis federally in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is more than all previous Congresses
combined in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year there were about 900 bills filed
across the United States in various states
[SPEAKER_08]: to legalize cannabis in various states for
the entire 2018.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just halfway through March of 2019 there
were more than 1200 bills filed in states
[SPEAKER_08]: across the United States to legalize
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: In this Congress there is already pending
legislation covering every single aspect
[SPEAKER_08]: of legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is advancing right now is the Safe
Banking Act just passed through the House
[SPEAKER_08]: Financial Services Committee.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to move on to the full House.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fully expected to pass the House and
there's a good chance it will pass the
[SPEAKER_08]: Senate too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Along with banking we're going to see a
lot of major catalysts in the next six
[SPEAKER_08]: months including protection for research
of cannabis, protections for veterans,
[SPEAKER_08]: for federal employees using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to see major progress and I
think leading to legalization within 12 to
[SPEAKER_08]: 18 months in the United States.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're at a point now where there's a
snowball rolling down a hill that started
[SPEAKER_08]: an avalanche and it's just a question of
how long it will take for that snowball to
[SPEAKER_08]: pick up enough momentum but the momentum
cannot be reversed.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are congressional cannabis co-chairs
working hard in the House and in the
[SPEAKER_08]: Senate.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are meetings and people working
full-time in Congress to legalize
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the state side we have 10 states that
have adult use legalized along with
[SPEAKER_08]: Washington D.C., 33 medical states.
[SPEAKER_08]: New York and New Jersey are racing forward
towards legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: New Jersey hit a little bit of a hiccup a
week ago but I think that this time next
[SPEAKER_08]: year cannabis will be sold in New York,
probably New Jersey or will be well on the
[SPEAKER_08]: way towards selling cannabis on the East
Coast in those major states.
[SPEAKER_08]: Michigan, just legalized cannabis,
Illinois is about to legalize cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: too.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have now most of the West Coast with
legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once those middle states in the Midwest of
Illinois and Michigan legalize and when
[SPEAKER_08]: one East Coast states legalizes like New
York, like New Jersey, like Connecticut or
[SPEAKER_08]: Pennsylvania all the others will legalize
at the same time or very quickly
[SPEAKER_08]: thereafter.
[SPEAKER_08]: At that point Congress will be forced to
act.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have the West, the Midwest and the
East Coast so we're moving very quickly
[SPEAKER_08]: towards legalization.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just gonna address the farm bill and
hemp for a little bit because there's a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of interest in hemp CBD products from
mainstream companies, not just cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: companies, there are now large CPG
companies looking at our industry and
[SPEAKER_08]: looking at hemp products in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: as an initial entry point.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the farm bill passed at the end of 2018
moved the hemp product off of the
[SPEAKER_08]: Controlled Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hemp is no longer a drug, it's now an
agricultural product, no longer under the
[SPEAKER_08]: authority of the DEA, the Department of
the Drug Enforcement Agency, it's now
[SPEAKER_08]: under the FDA's authority, the Food and
Drug Administration.
[SPEAKER_08]: The FDA has stepped in and said hang on,
hemp is federally legal but we still have
[SPEAKER_08]: authority over food and over making health
claims so the FDA has put out three pieces
[SPEAKER_08]: of clear guidance so far.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't add hemp or CBD from hemp to
food, you can't market or sell hemp as a
[SPEAKER_08]: dietary supplement and you can't make
disease or therapeutic claims relating to
[SPEAKER_08]: hemp or CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of the complication is that the FDA
has licensed drugs containing CBD and THC
[SPEAKER_08]: but CBD and Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once something is a drug, it can no longer
be added to a food, it can't be sold as a
[SPEAKER_08]: dietary supplement but with the hemp
derived CBD, my prediction is that the FDA
[SPEAKER_08]: realizes that this is a product unlike
anything else we've encountered,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's both medicinal, it's used for
wellness, it kind of goes across the
[SPEAKER_08]: spectrum especially for cannabis so the
FDA realizes there is tremendous demand
[SPEAKER_08]: for this product.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can't be a toothless tiger,
it can't just issue regulations that
[SPEAKER_08]: people won't follow, there are thousands
of companies selling CBD food products in
[SPEAKER_08]: the United States so the FDA is gonna come
out with regulations that reflect the fact
[SPEAKER_08]: that there is no real downside
demonstrated to CBD, just an upside and I
[SPEAKER_08]: think they'll issue new regulations that
will allow CBD to take the form of to be
[SPEAKER_08]: in a medicine, in a drug and make specific
disease claims if it goes through trials.
[SPEAKER_08]: There'll also be I think a dietary
supplement route, there'll be an OTC route
[SPEAKER_08]: and there'll be a GRAS route for food
products so unprecedented but I think the
[SPEAKER_08]: FDA is gonna figure it out and let's move
on to Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Canada legalized cannabis federally.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a major step towards the
whole world legalizing, the US will come
[SPEAKER_08]: next and I think after that Europe will
quickly follow.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's look at Canada as a test case so
to speak for recreational and medicinal
[SPEAKER_08]: use.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's start with the differences
between medical and adult use cannabis in
[SPEAKER_08]: Canada and Karina, you wanna take that
first?
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, yes we are definitely a test
case and the world is watching.
[SPEAKER_07]: On October 17th, 2018 we legalized
recreational cannabis while we had a long
[SPEAKER_07]: time that we had already legalized medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of the cultivation and processing
of the products, there really is no
[SPEAKER_07]: difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: Health Canada requires them to be
manufactured under good production
[SPEAKER_07]: practices.
[SPEAKER_07]: The main difference lies in how the
products are distributed so if you're a
[SPEAKER_07]: medical patient you will register your
prescription with a license holder and
[SPEAKER_07]: have that product delivered to you
directly from that license holder.
[SPEAKER_07]: The license holder can be anywhere in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas recreational product is
distributed by our provinces and each
[SPEAKER_07]: province has its own model.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be private based model or it can be
a provincially run store.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any adult over the age of majority or the
age that the province has decided can
[SPEAKER_07]: access recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: John, do you wanna add to that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, recreational use of cannabis does not
involve any constitutional rights in
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was established in a case I was
involved in in 2003 in the Supreme Court
[SPEAKER_06]: of Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: We started in 1995.
[SPEAKER_06]: Medical on the other hand, it was a case
called Parker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Matrullo mentioned epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Parker had epilepsy, tried everything
with his doctor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing worked, told his doctor that he
took a couple of puffs that would stop his
[SPEAKER_06]: seizure and so we established that a
medically approved patient has a right of
[SPEAKER_06]: reasonable access to his medicine in order
to prevent the violation of his
[SPEAKER_06]: constitutional rights to the security of
his person and the right not to have that
[SPEAKER_06]: taken away arbitrarily essentially was the
bottom line.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was back in 2001 which led to our
medical marijuana access regulations
[SPEAKER_06]: eventually to the Marijuana for Medical
Purposes regulations where the new
[SPEAKER_06]: government was trying to take away the
right to grow for yourself or have
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody grow for you and ultimately in a
more recent case called Allard we
[SPEAKER_06]: established that that was unconstitutional
what they were trying to do and to make a
[SPEAKER_06]: long story short we've now evolved into
from the access to cannabis for medical
[SPEAKER_06]: purposes regulations to part 14 of the
Cannabis Act.
[SPEAKER_06]: The big defect however is that while the
provinces get to distribute cannabis in
[SPEAKER_06]: retail stores for recreational purposes
there are no equivalent medical
[SPEAKER_06]: dispensaries or compassion clubs.
[SPEAKER_06]: They exist and they have existed since at
least 1997 in British Columbia but the
[SPEAKER_06]: government has not provided for that for
medical patients and there's a huge
[SPEAKER_06]: difference between medical patients and
their access and recreational.
[SPEAKER_06]: That issue we are still currently
litigating in Vancouver and it's in the
[SPEAKER_06]: Court of Appeal so time will tell and
hopefully we'll establish that having the
[SPEAKER_06]: ability to go to a medical dispensary will
be part of the patient's reasonable
[SPEAKER_06]: access.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks John.
[SPEAKER_08]: Quickly are extracts extracted products
legal on the adult use market in Canada
[SPEAKER_08]: today?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not currently.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about edibles?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are edibles legal?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well edibles extracts and topicals are
subject to consultations at the moment in
[SPEAKER_06]: order to they're going to be regulated as
of October of this year one year from the
[SPEAKER_06]: date of legalizing rec.
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is they're going to limit the
amount of THC to I think it's 10
[SPEAKER_06]: milligrams in the edibles and the
extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my clients in Allard is a 25 gram a
day approved medical patient who was brain
[SPEAKER_06]: damaged and who's now off all of his
opiates and only on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: He would have to buy 2500 packages from
the store in order to get his supply so he
[SPEAKER_06]: would probably get sick from the sugar in
the edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're simply going to encourage the
underground market to continue because
[SPEAKER_06]: novice users may need small amounts but
there are established medical users who
[SPEAKER_06]: will not overdose or take too much.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there won't be separate regulations for
medical users for edibles and extracts?
[SPEAKER_06]: No currently they don't plan to do that
but that's something that we will be
[SPEAKER_06]: pushing for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Karina what about importing and exporting
cannabis to and from Canada?
[SPEAKER_07]: So import into Canada right now is allowed
for medical scientific purposes and export
[SPEAKER_07]: is permitted so in both cases you need to
have the correct import export permits and
[SPEAKER_07]: the correct licenses on both sides of the
border where you're importing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And John what about for hemp?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you can you import and export hemp and
not extract the cannabinoids from hemp?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes it's the limitation as I understand it
is you can only import or export and you
[SPEAKER_06]: need a permit for each importer export for
scientific medical or industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_06]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is provision for import export of
industrial hemp and there's some technical
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff to do with very minor amounts of THC
which make it easier to import export but
[SPEAKER_06]: generally the same rules apply.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the same for CBD isolate from hemp?
[SPEAKER_08]: My understanding would be the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: Karina what are the kind of highlights and
maybe mistakes or things that could have
[SPEAKER_08]: gone better in Canada's rollout of adult
use legalization?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one of the highlights is seeing
the market really expand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Historically we've been limited by a few
large players in cannabis and now that the
[SPEAKER_07]: licensing is picking up there's a lot more
opportunities for new players to bring in
[SPEAKER_07]: their bring in their products bring in
their brands.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also with October 17th legalization they
opened up companies are now allowed to
[SPEAKER_07]: declare new genetics into the system which
is very important for diversification of
[SPEAKER_07]: products.
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of areas for improvement
definitely I think the advertising and
[SPEAKER_07]: labeling restrictions need to be
critically assessed.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you know Health Canada has said that
one of their objectives is to eliminate
[SPEAKER_07]: the black market but if you can't build a
brand that's going to be very challenging
[SPEAKER_07]: for businesses.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things that I think that I
thought was true Justin Trudeau Prime
[SPEAKER_08]: Minister Trudeau was most effective in
convincing people that adult use would be
[SPEAKER_08]: a good for Canada actually was a high rate
of teen of teen usage in Canada and the
[SPEAKER_08]: fact that legalization regulation
eliminates or reduces the black market.
[SPEAKER_08]: How is that actually played out?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still very very early.
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly it is another one of Health
Canada's policy objectives is to keep it
[SPEAKER_07]: out of the hands of youth.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a 14 year old it's also one of my
objectives but it's still very very early
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean the market still has supply
limitations and it's going to be a few
[SPEAKER_07]: years before we actually realize those
objectives.
[SPEAKER_08]: John what do you take away from Canada's
legalization for adult use highlights
[SPEAKER_08]: things that could have gone better the
effect on youth usage?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well currently the underground market
continues to thrive there's lots of
[SPEAKER_06]: complaints about product quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: The good thing was the announcement that
they'd have micro producers and
[SPEAKER_06]: microprocessors to bring in the craft
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately the cost of trying to do
that has become prohibitive and so we
[SPEAKER_06]: don't have all of a sudden many micros
that have been approved so we're not doing
[SPEAKER_06]: well and bringing in the smaller producers
who have been part of the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: My biggest criticism is that Canada has
tried to create a new market instead of
[SPEAKER_06]: bringing everybody in rolling everybody in
as we did for alcohol years ago with the
[SPEAKER_06]: Kennedys and the Bronfmans and the
Seagrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not roll them in regulate them give
them licenses and that way we could
[SPEAKER_06]: continue the existing industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Karina how is Canada going to compete
globally when cannabis can be grown for
[SPEAKER_08]: much much cheaper in South America and
Africa and the US and California is where
[SPEAKER_08]: many many global brands come from.
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree we have work to do and we do have
a first mover advantage so I think that by
[SPEAKER_07]: using our homegrown talent as well as the
research that's taking off now in Canada I
[SPEAKER_07]: think those are advantages for us
certainly growing outside in Canada is not
[SPEAKER_07]: as good as growing outside in Colombia but
we do have a lot of talent in our industry
[SPEAKER_07]: to bring that to the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: John I just think you need to understand
that Canada has legalized a little bit you
[SPEAKER_06]: can grow four plants per household and
they were going to make it had to be a
[SPEAKER_06]: hundred centimeters and no more but I
think they realized that the police would
[SPEAKER_06]: then have to have tape measures on their
belts and that the plant might suddenly
[SPEAKER_06]: sprout between Friday and Monday but so
they abandoned that at least but you can
[SPEAKER_06]: possess 30 grams and you're out and about
so that's the that's the legalization if
[SPEAKER_06]: you breach that and go slightly over say
five or six plants or 50 grams or whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a ticketing scheme that's what we
call decriminalization with a maximum fine
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's $200 something like that but
if you go above that there's still a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of criminal law Canada's legislation that
their constitutional power they've used is
[SPEAKER_06]: still the criminal law and they've simply
given the provinces the permission to do
[SPEAKER_06]: the the retail distribution and so when
you're above the ticketing scheme we have
[SPEAKER_06]: still summary and indictable offenses you
probably understand better if I use the u
[SPEAKER_06]: .s.
[SPEAKER_06]: misdemeanor for summary and felony for
indictable and the maximum penalties on
[SPEAKER_06]: indictment in Canada is still 14 years
imprisonment which the conservative
[SPEAKER_06]: government jacked up from seven years and
the ladain Commission back in 1972
[SPEAKER_06]: recommended a max of five years so that
has all kinds of legal consequences in
[SPEAKER_06]: terms of the continued use of the criminal
law so that's the the Canadian model it's
[SPEAKER_06]: not I mean I think a lot of its smoke and
mirror is in order to pacify the right
[SPEAKER_06]: wing and I'll be surprised to see people
getting busted for those sorts of
[SPEAKER_06]: indictable offenses but that is the
landscape and so there's gonna be a lot to
[SPEAKER_08]: watch as we roll along do you want to talk
about the single convention we didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: rehearse this but do you want to address
that all I can address that people need to
[SPEAKER_06]: understand that unlike the u.s.
[SPEAKER_06]: where I think when you pass a treaty it
becomes part of the law of the land that's
[SPEAKER_06]: not the case in Canada in Canada we have
to pass domestic legislation in order to
[SPEAKER_06]: implement a treaty and when Canada
implemented the treaty and passed the
[SPEAKER_06]: Controlled Drugs and Substances Act that's
the the current act we expressly provided
[SPEAKER_06]: that the minister could make exemptions to
the act in relation to a drug a type of
[SPEAKER_06]: drug classes of persons and so on so we
reserved the ability to do what we're
[SPEAKER_08]: doing so sorry for interrupting so in
Canada basically you've been able to
[SPEAKER_08]: legalize notwithstanding your
participation we're not technically in
[SPEAKER_06]: agreement with the international treaty we
signed but we're in compliance with our
[SPEAKER_08]: law understood right in the in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_08]: that that's one of the issues that they're
grappling with in Congress it's an
[SPEAKER_08]: international treaty called a single
convention that would prevent the United
[SPEAKER_08]: States from effectively complying with the
treaty and federally legalizing cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: for European countries it's a big deal too
I think that the just like in Canada the u
[SPEAKER_08]: .s.
[SPEAKER_08]: will find a way around it and at that
point it's going to cause I think the rest
[SPEAKER_08]: of the world to follow suit well let's
move to Europe Francis and you show me a
[SPEAKER_08]: picture of your fine Swiss chocolate which
and one thing that struck me was that your
[SPEAKER_08]: your packaging what was very very clever
to comply with the legal landscape that
[SPEAKER_08]: you have to navigate so can you just give
us an overview of what is the status of
[SPEAKER_08]: hemp derived products in Switzerland and
the EU more more broadly okay this this
[SPEAKER_03]: should be entitled navigating a minefield
because it's a really complicated topic
[SPEAKER_03]: you know up until 2018 it was already a
very difficult subject because in the
[SPEAKER_03]: different countries in the EU you have a
lot of fragmentation in terms of how the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations are interpreted by the
authorities but things became a way more
[SPEAKER_03]: confusing in January because the European
Commission decided to update what's called
[SPEAKER_03]: the novel food catalog and if you're
familiar with the novel food regulation
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it's a regulation that dated dates
from May 1997 at that time the the
[SPEAKER_03]: European Commission decided to enact this
regulation in order to protect public
[SPEAKER_03]: health so the the spirit of the regulation
is actually to to ensure that food
[SPEAKER_03]: operators they continue to innovate but
when within a framework which allows for
[SPEAKER_03]: an approval process of anything that would
be considered novel that means not eaten
[SPEAKER_03]: prior to May 1997 and also to to give
guidance so to operators and to regulators
[SPEAKER_03]: so in January what happened was that in
the in the catalog you can Google it you
[SPEAKER_03]: can go on to the the novel foods catalog
it's very simple and you can type in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and you will come up with
actually three entries at the moment one
[SPEAKER_03]: has been cancelled and that was kind of
video the other one is cannabis sativa L
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they created a new one called
cannabinoids now up until the 20th of
[SPEAKER_03]: January of this year we only had two we
only had one which was cannabis sativa L
[SPEAKER_03]: and cannabidiol so under cannabis sativa L
there was a wonderful green tick meaning
[SPEAKER_03]: that it could be used in a food product
okay because it's been used for centuries
[SPEAKER_03]: in Europe it's not novel it's not
considered novel the plant all right but
[SPEAKER_03]: it also depends on the part of the plant
whether you're talking about the seeds the
[SPEAKER_03]: flower the leaves and this all is
interpreted differently in different
[SPEAKER_03]: legislations as well because the bottom
line with the novel food regulation is
[SPEAKER_03]: that the European Commission also defers
to the individual country in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: their own specific regulations so then you
can have these torques and tweaks in the
[SPEAKER_03]: application of that right so it's very
confusing and you really need to know the
[SPEAKER_08]: regulations so in your packaging you
cleverly intimate that there is CBD
[SPEAKER_08]: because you're getting a full spectrum
hemp product without saying there is CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: in it which I thought was a clever
solution because in a full spectrum hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: back you know product you have CBD it's
natural right right and but I don't say
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD I can't say CBD if you and this is why
you see what's happening since probably
[SPEAKER_03]: the last since November December and a lot
of countries in Europe like Austria they
[SPEAKER_03]: started removing a lot of products from
the market from the shelves in Italy that
[SPEAKER_03]: took place as well cannabis stores were
getting fines so it's kind of like the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulators suddenly woke up you know
because they they enacted a new novel food
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation from January 2018 replacing the
97 regulation and it was like it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: delayed effect because it was at the end
of 2018 the different countries in Europe
[SPEAKER_03]: started to actively remove products and
send warning letters to operators to
[SPEAKER_08]: remove their products but don't you think
though it's really just a matter of time
[SPEAKER_08]: because if we talk about something like
alcohol or even pharmaceutical products
[SPEAKER_08]: the regulators are struggling with the
advantages and the disadvantages the side
[SPEAKER_08]: effects the bad effects right here we have
a product without there are some minor
[SPEAKER_08]: example situations and certain people have
certain problems maybe can't have too much
[SPEAKER_08]: CBD but in general terms there is not
really recognized downside to this right
[SPEAKER_03]: so no and you saw what what happened at
the United Nations with the WHO with the
[SPEAKER_03]: expert committee and drugs independence
last year so there was a lot of good news
[SPEAKER_03]: around CBD there was two sessions last
year the 40th and 41st sessions in the
[SPEAKER_03]: 40th session they actually made a
recommendation that CBD and also cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: extracts should be deleted from the
schedule one of the 1961 single convention
[SPEAKER_03]: of narcotics right and then in another
session I think it was October November
[SPEAKER_03]: October and then I was I attended both of
them as a guest yeah and in the second one
[SPEAKER_03]: then they talked about THC and they talked
about analogs of THC in that and then you
[SPEAKER_03]: saw that the recommendations were
published in January 24th there was the
[SPEAKER_03]: letter they sent the letter to the
Secretary General of the United Nations
[SPEAKER_03]: with the recommendations to delist these
products from the scheduling and on the
[SPEAKER_03]: 7th of March there was supposed to be a
vote but it was postponed by the the
[SPEAKER_03]: Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna so
that's still pending I mean it's good news
[SPEAKER_03]: and it will give a very good positive sign
to all the different countries that have
[SPEAKER_03]: signed up to that convention but I think
we're still you know it has to be
[SPEAKER_03]: translated into you know legislation I
mean legislation and regulation is
[SPEAKER_08]: important and safeguarding all these
products making that keeping the public
[SPEAKER_08]: safe is of course of prime importance but
in the United States we have cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis edibles for years and years in
markets and nothing has ever happened to
[SPEAKER_08]: anyone I mean no one has died from having
cannabis edibles some people go to the
[SPEAKER_08]: hospital maybe from having way too much
THC and ER doctors say that they just tell
[SPEAKER_08]: them to go to sleep so what's not we're
not dealing with a very dangerous
[SPEAKER_08]: situation I think and the regulators will
just have to wrap their hands heads around
[SPEAKER_08]: all it and recognize that the market
demand is there and they have to meet that
[SPEAKER_06]: demand did you want to add something John
just I'm always entertained by Health
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada has on its web page information for
health care practitioners so advise
[SPEAKER_06]: doctors what to do so there's a section at
the very end of it that talks about
[SPEAKER_06]: overdose and toxicity and of course the
first line is there's no lethal dose and
[SPEAKER_06]: the second one is is that yes some people
get panic attacks and anxiety and in those
[SPEAKER_06]: rare cases doctor when you see something
like that you sit the person diet down and
[SPEAKER_06]: quietly assured them that everything's
going to be okay and maybe in a rare case
[SPEAKER_06]: give them a benzodiazepine and I'm not
sure that's a good advice anymore what we
[SPEAKER_08]: were learning about benzos anyway all
right so I think we covered a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: ground this industry and it is the title
of my white paper from an investor's
[SPEAKER_08]: perspective this is a regulatory arbitrage
from a business operators perspective
[SPEAKER_08]: you're as Francis said navigating a
regulatory minefield but I think if you're
[SPEAKER_08]: looking at this from an investor's
perspective there's a lot of mismatch of
[SPEAKER_08]: value in this industry there's regulatory
risk and overhang that suppresses
[SPEAKER_08]: valuations especially in the United States
right where we have robust state legal
[SPEAKER_08]: economies but federal illegality which
causes a wall to institutional capital to
[SPEAKER_08]: big related industry companies to enter
the industry to things like sovereign
[SPEAKER_08]: wealth funds and pension funds and the
Church of England can't invest in the
[SPEAKER_08]: United States cannabis and also in the
industry has enormous burdens like paying
[SPEAKER_08]: 80 to 90 percent marginal tax rates
because they can't deduct the cost of
[SPEAKER_08]: goods sold we can't do research you can't
have interstate commerce still hard to
[SPEAKER_08]: attract top professionals all these
barriers will come crashing down with
[SPEAKER_08]: federal legalization so if anybody is
looking at the investment landscape I
[SPEAKER_08]: think look at it from the regulatory lens
because that's where you'll find arbitrage
[SPEAKER_08]: opportunities where things are not valued
at where they would be if this was a
[SPEAKER_08]: regular industry and it will be one day
but but it if you wait till then you might
[SPEAKER_08]: as well just invest in a restaurant or any
other industry right now there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: opportunity here that regulations are
creating David can I add one more thing on
[SPEAKER_03]: the European situation just to finish the
European chapter we spent a lot of time in
[SPEAKER_03]: North America so yeah we're in Berlin so I
really touched on just one or two things
[SPEAKER_03]: but just to finish on the European
situation at the moment because of what
[SPEAKER_03]: happened in January with the changes in
the novel foods catalog in March the
[SPEAKER_03]: European Industrial Hemp Association they
met with the working group of the standing
[SPEAKER_03]: committee of what's it now plants animals
food and feed and this is the group of
[SPEAKER_03]: experts basically that the European
Commission deferred to in terms of their
[SPEAKER_03]: approval process and signing off approving
or not approving anything related to novel
[SPEAKER_03]: foods it was an important meeting because
the Hemp Association were able to put
[SPEAKER_03]: before this committee good reasons and
they actually showed 14 different examples
[SPEAKER_03]: of how hemp has already been consumed in
Europe since the oldest example they
[SPEAKER_03]: showed was from a tour in Bologna an old
tower from 1220 and it was a wonderful
[SPEAKER_03]: inscription on the walls because it what
the inscription said bread is life
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis protects yeah and protects in the
sense of homeostasis bringing equilibrium
[SPEAKER_03]: to the body and then the one I like wine
is joy right that that's how they they
[SPEAKER_03]: wrote it on the 1220 because there's a
huge history of the consumption of hemp in
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe even the even Pope Martin the fifth
was was eating hemp soup you know so
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a there's a lot of good arguments
they they made their case I think they did
[SPEAKER_03]: a very good job and if there's anybody
from the IHA in the room hats off to them
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was great because they they're
really trying to clarify this gray area
[SPEAKER_03]: between what's medical and what's
recreational you know because there's this
[SPEAKER_03]: whole area of relating to cosmetics
relating to food food supplements also
[SPEAKER_03]: construction and industrial uses of hemp
and they're they're really pushing to have
[SPEAKER_03]: clear regulations on that the last thing
that's happened just recently on the 22nd
[SPEAKER_03]: of March so just a few days ago an MEP
from Italy called Marco Zullo he made a
[SPEAKER_03]: written question because a politician or a
political party or a political
[SPEAKER_03]: organization in Europe has the right to
make a what's called a written question
[SPEAKER_03]: has to be a written question to the
European Commission and it was a very
[SPEAKER_03]: great question because with all this
confusion going on he clearly stated he've
[SPEAKER_03]: clearly asked the Commission so are you
going to come out with legislation
[SPEAKER_03]: regarding the area of food and cosmetics
right he really he's put that he's put
[SPEAKER_03]: their back up against the wall with the
request to answer that question in six
[SPEAKER_08]: weeks and if you mentioned that Francis a
bunch of Congress men and women also
[SPEAKER_08]: bipartisan basis sent a letter to the FDA
Commissioner same exact letter two weeks
[SPEAKER_03]: ago by the time of the next ICBC in Zurich
that should correspond to when hopefully
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll have an answer from the European
Commission which will hopefully clarify
[SPEAKER_08]: things so stay tuned so that it's a moving
target a lot of this a lot of these topics
[SPEAKER_08]: and yeah as Francis said it's rapidly
changing things will look different a year
[SPEAKER_08]: from now let's open it up to some
questions
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah who's got a question question
question who's got a question anyone okay
[SPEAKER_05]: of course well we'll go this way and then
we'll go that way and we're coming around
[SPEAKER_05]: good thing I wore comfortable shoes here
we go all right hey I'm Vincenzo American
[SPEAKER_02]: attorney question about we currently have
state regimes wildly disparate in how they
[SPEAKER_02]: enforce say Massachusetts and Maine right
next to each other and completely
[SPEAKER_02]: different laws on how you grow who can
grow how much it costs do you think when
[SPEAKER_02]: we have congressional action and it's
legal everywhere that the states that
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't legalized are gonna have an easier
time moving forward because they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to undo all of the restrictive
regimes that are in place now under the
[SPEAKER_08]: current proposed legislation that is most
likely to succeed it which is a state's
[SPEAKER_08]: act or some modified version of that the
states are gonna still be left to regulate
[SPEAKER_08]: what happens in their own states I mean we
see that in many other industries right
[SPEAKER_08]: just if you want to become a barber in New
York State it's different than becoming a
[SPEAKER_08]: barber in another state it's just a little
different and every state has their own
[SPEAKER_08]: regulations I think we're gonna see that
with cannabis too I think it might be some
[SPEAKER_08]: time before cannabis is sold in
Mississippi or Alabama but it's just their
[SPEAKER_08]: loss I think but every state is gonna
proceed differently and they'll have their
[SPEAKER_08]: own regulations now cultivation though is
gonna change once there's interstate
[SPEAKER_08]: commerce so it's naturally gonna have an
effect on the realities within each state
[SPEAKER_08]: but I think that in the US we have a
strong state powers states are assigned a
[SPEAKER_08]: high degree of powers versus a federal
government and they're gonna continue to
[SPEAKER_08]: be able to assert their authority over
cannabis for sure there's a little bit of
[SPEAKER_07]: parallel with Canada and the EU because
the states are gonna have to be careful
[SPEAKER_07]: that they do have a standard quality
management requirement for the product
[SPEAKER_07]: otherwise they're going to create more
trade one of the things we're struggling
[SPEAKER_08]: with in the United States is that it's on
a state-by-state basis now to regulate
[SPEAKER_08]: things like cannabis in food and states
are not equipped they don't have health
[SPEAKER_08]: departments that are capable of regulating
food products the FDA regulates food
[SPEAKER_08]: products for the United States and states
are looking to the FDA for guidance but
[SPEAKER_08]: the FDA is not regulating cannabis so once
there is federal legalization I think
[SPEAKER_08]: there will be a much more unified
situation in the United States but despite
[SPEAKER_08]: that states can go off and do their own
thing despite on top of that and there's a
[SPEAKER_06]: big distinction to appreciate between
Canada and the US criminal law is federal
[SPEAKER_06]: in Canada whereas its state power in the
US and that's why if you go back and look
[SPEAKER_06]: at history prohibition started in Utah and
crept across the country mainly against
[SPEAKER_06]: the Mexicans and eventually Canada may
prohibited in 1923 and your federal
[SPEAKER_06]: government didn't do it till 1937 now
history is rolling back the other way and
[SPEAKER_06]: we've legalized so we expect your federal
government to do it in the next 12 months
[SPEAKER_08]: but it actually is the federal criminal
law in the United States that impedes the
[SPEAKER_08]: industry right the schedule one status
which makes it a crime right to engage in
[SPEAKER_08]: commerce with with cannabis is what makes
it a federal crime so we have state
[SPEAKER_08]: criminal legislation but also federal
crimes for being involved in interstate
[SPEAKER_00]: commerce related to cannabis any other
questions okay free cannabis hemp in
[SPEAKER_00]: Avalon Glastonbury my question relates to
the food regulations novelty foods and
[SPEAKER_00]: novel ways of getting around it why
because I've been selling CBD drugs about
[SPEAKER_00]: five years now one of the first in Britain
I think and since January what I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing is selling Bangsar Amrita Sindhu
temple incense with the disclaimer that
[SPEAKER_00]: legally this product is not for use by the
person the person is the legal fiction and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the awareness is happening in
Britain now is people becoming aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fraud of the name the fiction and all
the criminality of prohibition my question
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to is there a movement within
Europe who people have had enough of the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual blatant crime of cannabis
prohibition and we all have an essential
[SPEAKER_00]: need for this plant so any legislation
prohibiting that must be criminal it's
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-human and is there movement in well
worldwide to actually people being
[SPEAKER_00]: empowered to just get on with it grow the
plant and share it within their
[SPEAKER_03]: communities you're touching on the whole
topic of hypocrisy and and I can't give
[SPEAKER_03]: you a straight answer for that because it
still is that situation unfortunately
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a mass uprising that's right and
that's why I think you said like it can't
[SPEAKER_03]: be stopped it's a wave that's moving
forward can't be stopped it's a wonderful
[SPEAKER_03]: thing it's fantastic it's amazing well
we've seen what we've seen in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_08]: ultimately is is that business and tax
revenues are what is moving the
[SPEAKER_08]: conversation forward this is ultimately
about individual liberty and about people
[SPEAKER_08]: being able to use whatever medicine or
whatever makes them feel good but
[SPEAKER_08]: ultimately what is driving politicians who
might otherwise not be convinced is the
[SPEAKER_08]: dollars right so that's what causes
political progress to be made that's the
[SPEAKER_06]: reality I've been involved in this since
1972 so it can't happen quickly enough
[SPEAKER_05]: sorry I'm coming here I go
[SPEAKER_01]: if you do like analyzing realize you from
Berlin as much as I understand that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's an outcry in the industry about
CBD entry in the novel food catalogue but
[SPEAKER_01]: if CBD and hemp products are food then
they automatically fall under the food
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation that was not made to legalize
CBD it had nothing to do with it so CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts are now treated like any other
plant extract like rosemary oil or a
[SPEAKER_01]: protein extract so it's for me it's
completely plausible that the moment you
[SPEAKER_01]: enrich and isolate something you fall
under the regular food regulation exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: how it should be yeah in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_08]: we have a company application though where
CBD has been approved as a drug so you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't add drugs to food so it's a
different story so if I look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing claims there is another issue
coming but for me it's completely logical
[SPEAKER_01]: that an extract as food has to be treated
like any other extract sorry yeah it's
[SPEAKER_03]: either it's either medical or food in
Europe it's very clear cut between the two
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no but this gray zone for sure
because a lot of operators don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: where to go but there it's that's the way
the regulator looks at it it's either
[SPEAKER_08]: medical or food one or the other but if a
big pharmaceutical company gets a patent
[SPEAKER_08]: for CBD to be in a drug product that means
that you won't be able to have it enough
[SPEAKER_03]: in the food anymore but if I have I'm
using a full spectrum hemp and it's
[SPEAKER_08]: naturally present right yeah the question
I think was directly related to CBD right
[SPEAKER_03]: in an isolate no there any extra I
remember you know in the beginning of my
[SPEAKER_03]: little journey over a year and a half ago
I went to my regulator I went to my local
[SPEAKER_03]: regulator and I went to the controlling
laboratory and I said so I want to do this
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make chocolate help me what do I
need to comply with and they and they said
[SPEAKER_03]: well basically there's three main things
one the plant has to be EU news from the
[SPEAKER_03]: EU certified hemp meaning that it has to
be one of the hemp varieties on the the
[SPEAKER_03]: common registry in the EU 16 at the moment
two it's got to be a traditional
[SPEAKER_03]: processing technique so very very
specifically you can't add CBD to it or
[SPEAKER_03]: take it away you can't manipulate it has
to reflect what's extracted from naturally
[SPEAKER_03]: from the plant okay and three no THC no
THC is zero in Europe in Switzerland is 1%
[SPEAKER_03]: Switzerland is an outlier you know Swiss
is pioneer when it comes to a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: things but but zero also depends on the
country you know because you have some
[SPEAKER_03]: some people say oh my analytical technique
goes down to zero point zero zero zero
[SPEAKER_03]: something that's my zero or in another
country at zero point three or zero point
[SPEAKER_03]: five or zero points it's and that's where
the headaches start because if you're an
[SPEAKER_03]: operating you're producing a Swiss
chocolate like I am I mean I do other
[SPEAKER_03]: things too besides chocolate we've got
farmers as well but you know and you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to make a product that's compliant for the
whole of the EU it's tricky yeah it's
[SPEAKER_06]: tricky you have to be very careful Canada
the limit is point three percent THC which
[SPEAKER_06]: I think is the same in the US and but
there's no limits on kind of a dial or
[SPEAKER_06]: other cannabinoids in the hemp but it's
because it's not a controlled substance
[SPEAKER_06]: CBD yeah it never was you well we have
industrial hemp regulations and
[SPEAKER_06]: historically that really allowed you to
make hemp hearts and really nothing much
[SPEAKER_06]: else until these regulations were put
under the Cannabis Act and those
[SPEAKER_06]: limitations don't exist anymore and there
are specific exemptions if your hemp
[SPEAKER_06]: product is made from the seed and is less
than 10 micrograms of THC that's not
[SPEAKER_06]: governed by the act other than
requirements of what you put on the label
[SPEAKER_05]: when you're importing or exporting
fantastic we have time for one more brief
[SPEAKER_05]: question and then we're gonna I'm sorry
you guys I got it back here but I'm sure
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll be they'd love to talk to you in
the hallway here one last question hi Mike
[SPEAKER_04]: Hogan from the United States thank you all
could you elaborate on the disparity
[SPEAKER_04]: between the single convention and US
federal law and what might be done to sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of reconcile those two regulatory
frameworks thank you so so right now I
[SPEAKER_08]: don't think there's a there's a disparity
I think if the US wouldn't legalize
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis which is one of the drugs that's
included in the single convention then
[SPEAKER_08]: there would be a a disparity and I think
that it would require the US probably to
[SPEAKER_08]: withdraw from it or get the treaty amended
because treaties are that the US signs on
[SPEAKER_08]: to become part of US federal law basically
so something will have to be done but the
[SPEAKER_08]: US has dealt with more complicated
international treaty obligations than that
[SPEAKER_08]: and there are ways for the Congress to
address that Senator shots from Hawaii is
[SPEAKER_08]: particularly focused on this I can connect
you with him if you want to take this take
[SPEAKER_05]: up this issue further thank you all so
very much I'm sorry that we're out of time
[SPEAKER_05]: one more time for our excellent panel was
an excellent overview we really appreciate
[SPEAKER_05]: your time and your energy and your
thoughts and your discussion
