[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot the Raptors won the championship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've been smoking a lot of
Canadian weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I am now, along with my wonderful
daughter, Tyler Milan, I'm the CVO of
[SPEAKER_00]: Deuces 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Chief Visionary Oracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave myself that title.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the CEO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listening to this panel was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've been doing this,
well, I've been in this, what do they call
[SPEAKER_00]: it in Canada?
[SPEAKER_00]: The gray market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been supporting the gray market with
half my salary since 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got involved and in this business
three, four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is amazing where it's gone from
then to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on stage three years ago at the ICBC
in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now travel everywhere because we
realize our input helps move this along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as much knowledge as we can share
amongst one another, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've won four championships, like he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done it by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only done it with a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may seem like we're going to be in
competition here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We literally are in unity here because we
are still illegal in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still illegal in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still are in a situation where people
are getting, I just talked to my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: People in jail for 20 years, 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York just released 10,000 people on a
state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the state jail is $10,000
light, 10,000 people light.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are making millions and millions of
dollars off of the backs of people who
[SPEAKER_00]: just wanted to smoke a joint, who wanted
to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend and I will encourage you,
everyone, if you're going to be in this
[SPEAKER_00]: business, do not come into this business
with the mentality of me, me, me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This weed is about us, us, us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best thing about having flour is being
able to have a community joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also herpes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we won't talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's why we have four joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when somebody say, let me hit that,
here's one for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Community among yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just being serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on that thought, when we came up,
the first place I smoked weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of weed was in 2000 here in
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing a movie called The Ultimate
Christmas Present.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just knew I could not go through TSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to smoke all of the weed and look
at the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen things that I have never seen
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I need more weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the point where I recommend this to my
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend that they smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught one of my daughters with a vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's trying to be all cool and hide
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I got CBD vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to vape, vape this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now somebody would say, but you should
have told her not to vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, she's already proven to me she's going
to do what she wants to do and how.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my job as a parent to give a healthy
alternative to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, alcohol has dropped 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: DUIs have gone down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops can't sit around and pull you
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can lean in your car and say,
do I smell marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are at a total disconnect from the
old way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that he just told me that the
person in charge of regulation in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: was a chief of police, that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost as ridiculous as having sex
ed at church.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to tell you not to,
unless you're Catholic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to tell you to have as many
to bring back to the church as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And come tell me your creepy stories.
Anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: go back over that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, enough of the jokes on
Catholics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the place I'm glad no one got up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody that comes after, I want you to
pay attention because there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: avenues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many ways we need to touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live a plant-based diet with my family,
my daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're vegan, so we believe in every part
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe in the hemp plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe in the sister of the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe in the tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe in the cucumber, the asparagus,
all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't believe in murder of any kind,
of any earthly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to be of that kind,
but imagine how good it feels to have
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to nourish your body, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see the strongest ox eating
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see the gorilla eating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just finished talking about the Carr
sisters out in Palm Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are on the verge of living longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you noticed, but we
started living longer in the 50s and 60s,
[SPEAKER_00]: with penicillin and some of the things
that they put forth, ways we were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they started destroying us again with
packaging and processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's back to that wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: A wave now is back to nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: A wave now is back to enhancing you as a
human.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a wonderful place to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am ecstatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met some wonderful people from New York,
Jackie and her crew, literally here to get
[SPEAKER_00]: information to bring back to New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people doing that throughout the
United States expands it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States is the richest country
in the world, maybe not with all of its
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals, but with the minds, the thinking
minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that when we get 25 states that
say we're recreational, pretty soon
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to drop and they're going to
start thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's they're doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to start thinking of ways to
take it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just told the young lady here to stay
in the gray market, keep knocking on the
[SPEAKER_00]: door, keep pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend you go to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a lot of fun, so I hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like gray all the time,
you don't want to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing bright is the suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be smoking weed outside
going, you shouldn't have listened to that
[SPEAKER_00]: motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cool part is this is the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we said, we are in the beginning
stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to everybody in this room to make
this thing stay for the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to us to make sure they don't
bastardize it, make sure they don't make
[SPEAKER_00]: it such a chemical that you forget that
you are smoking this wonderful healing
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important that we stand for all of
these things that help us as a race,
[SPEAKER_00]: human race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we might not destroy other
earthlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might not think of the worst thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might not want to go to war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine smoking weed and just sitting back
and going, I don't like you, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I like you a little bit better now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what this plant does.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant opens up parts of your brain
that you don't have closed by
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have closed by hate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have closed by programming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This helps you deprogram.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant that helps you become the
best human you can possibly be.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, anybody got any important
questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it one more time for John
Sally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, one love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Sally, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is great.
