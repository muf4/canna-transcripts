[SPEAKER_03]: Coming up next to discuss Germany as a
cannabis economic hub, the chief economist
[SPEAKER_03]: for Whitney economics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've said economics like four times now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it for Bo Whitney!
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate the strong turnout and
it's great to be back at ICBC again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I first spoke here in 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spoke on the second day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking about why people consume
cannabis and Dr. Rafael Mishulam spoke the
[SPEAKER_02]: first day and he was going through all of
his medical research and it was striking
[SPEAKER_02]: to me that the research that he was doing,
the clinical trials and showing the
[SPEAKER_02]: effects on the human body very early on
and he's doing clinical trials and the
[SPEAKER_02]: like, it mirrored almost identical to why
people were choosing to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was anxiety pain management,
dietary stuff and so it was quite an honor
[SPEAKER_02]: to be on that stage and it's quite an
honor to be back here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today I'm going to talk about the
economics of cannabis and what the impact
[SPEAKER_02]: of the reform is in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: I generally go through, I gave a similar
presentation yesterday at the Global
[SPEAKER_02]: Investment Forum which I thought was an
amazing event, very, very successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I generally go through just a high
level global and then I'll look at the U
[SPEAKER_02]: .S.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk about Europe and then we'll dig
into some details on the German market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a little bit about me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in the cannabis industry looking
at this from the, oh, there we go,
[SPEAKER_02]: from the economic perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been looking at cannabis for about 10
years now and my firm, Whitney Economics,
[SPEAKER_02]: is a global leader in cannabis
enhancement.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do business consulting, we provide data
to the industry, economic research,
[SPEAKER_02]: we advise individuals, businesses,
governments, regulators, legislators and
[SPEAKER_02]: the like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just at a high level, cannabis is
really three industries in one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the adult use, the medical and the
industrial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the industrial can be broken down into
fiber and grain, fiber used for plastics
[SPEAKER_02]: and automobile parts and like grains for
feed for animal and human consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the cannabinoid sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: And countries are viewing cannabis as a
tool for economic development.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really see the growth potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see the environmental impacts and
they really like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis in general is a trillion
dollar market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it just needs to be realized.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be supported and nurtured.
[SPEAKER_02]: As it transitions away and into more
environmentally friendly practices,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can help transition away from the
traditional industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and one thing to note is that a lot of
countries are waiting for the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: to reform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: reforms, then other countries will choose
to reform.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my hypothesis now is that with so many
things going on in Europe, in Germany and
[SPEAKER_02]: the like, that maybe European markets will
take the mantle of leadership in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis reform movement and displace the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just too much dysfunction in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: market right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So currently there's 115 countries that
have legal access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they choose the reasons for legal
access for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be environmental.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be economic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be job creation and the like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nonetheless, there's a lot of reform
and this reform is accelerating.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's about half a million or half a
billion consumers on the high end globally
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ranges from a 250 to 500 billion dollar
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've got another 500 billion to
750 billion on the hemp total addressable
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a global industry and it's
huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do economic modeling using different
data sets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more conservative side is the
orange bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's data taken from the UNODC,
the UN, they do these surveys every year,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, not every year, but from time to
time in different countries on cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption and like drug consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their usage rate levels for consumers
are very, very conservative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's understandable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a government official says,
hi, I'm from the UN.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you smoke weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you know, if you're in a place like
Singapore or something, then generally
[SPEAKER_02]: your answer is going to be no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you do consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the UNODC numbers are rather
conservative.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green bar is some data that models
that I put together that I leverage the UN
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers, but then I update them a little
bit from what I'm seeing in different
[SPEAKER_02]: markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tap into all these different markets
all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's the high end,
which is, you know, a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: aggressive approach to the cannabis
consumer consumption rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I found when I looked at all
these 115 countries is that the total
[SPEAKER_02]: addressable market that's illegal and
legal consumption put together,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I found is that in countries that
have medical reform, there's actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are the largest markets combined
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a lot of economic
opportunity if you get into these markets
[SPEAKER_02]: and then get a foothold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as they transition into adult
use, then you're already in those markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can just expand your capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the 237 billion is based upon
the conservative side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just think of the upside potential on
some of these more aggressive forecasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the US, people look at the US a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a
little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, $28.8 billion in legal sales in
the adult use and medical space.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're forecasting 29 billion for this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's 10% year over year growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most industries would love to have 10%
year over year growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the cannabis space, because in the
early days they experienced 18,
[SPEAKER_02]: 20, 30, 35% growth, you know, 10% is kind
of a disappointment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you look at and peel back some of
the layers of the onion, 10 states,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of a different story.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 states actually saw declines in their
revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of surprising because you
still saw growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the growth wasn't coming from the
mature states.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was coming from all the new states.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's some regulatory issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's test inflation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rather rampant.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC test inflation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less than 20% of licensees in a recent
survey that we put out and published a
[SPEAKER_02]: report on.
[SPEAKER_02]: About a year ago, less than 20% of the
licensees were actually profitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's economic stress in the US
market right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: $3.8 billion in delinquent payments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So vendors aren't paying each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And retail isn't paying their cultivators
and the like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is a major issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just put out a report on this as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's this hyper focus by regulators
on hemp-derived cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're trying to bring that under the
marijuana jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not quite sure if that's the right
way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've got a nearly $80 billion
list of market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though there's a lot going on in
the US market, it could be regulated much
[SPEAKER_02]: better than it actually is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some federal reform that's on
the discussion table from safe access to
[SPEAKER_02]: interstate commerce, legalization efforts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really fragmented.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really dysfunctional at the
federal level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not anticipating very much federal
reform to occur in the near term.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's going to be kind of the status
quo, at least for the next few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And rescheduling is being talked about in
the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know if that's going to be the
panacea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be as beneficial to all
as people think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there may be some unintended
consequences on that reform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, despite the challenges, we're looking
for strong growth in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of this growth just comes from these
new emerging markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some that have already deployed their
programs but are just ramping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a question in the audience in
the last panel that talked about the
[SPEAKER_02]: social clubs and how do you get a bigger
market in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the panelists rightly said that
it takes more than just having social
[SPEAKER_02]: clubs in order to expand the market here
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because unless you have access,
you don't have legal participation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the more access that you can get to
consumers, the more opportunities there
[SPEAKER_02]: are for legal participation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a big key.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll go into that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by 2035, we're looking at,
what, $87 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty decent market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's taking a big chunk out of the
illicit market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's all because of access.
[SPEAKER_02]: So contrast that to the EU.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the US, they look at hemp and cannabis
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the EU, it's all cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's refreshing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they just regulate it based upon
the product intention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people aren't tripping over
themselves trying to figure out what's
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp and what's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the countries here in Europe
are defaulting to the EU rules and
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this German rollout here is one of
those indicators that could be a catalyst
[SPEAKER_02]: to have different reform and accelerate
the reform throughout different European
[SPEAKER_02]: countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that the EU could be a
sleeping giant in this regard in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: not only showing increases in reform
movements within the EU, but throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: the world as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in terms of numbers, the total
addressable market that's illicit and
[SPEAKER_02]: legal combined in Europe, conservatively
using the UN data, is $53 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you use a more aggressive modeling,
then it's $126 billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the countries are looking at
reform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're doing things kind of
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some want pilot programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some want social clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some want other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a little bit directionless.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no one model that's emerging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you think about it, for the eastern
and southern parts of Europe, they could
[SPEAKER_02]: become the providers of raw materials and
finished goods, product-manufactured
[SPEAKER_02]: goods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they can export them into the
central part of Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a viable model because
you have low-cost producers and suppliers
[SPEAKER_02]: in the periphery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have the more
higher-generating income earners and
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers in the central part.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's not much data on this quite
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I have to shameless plug,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're getting better in terms of the
data and the data offerings.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm always looking for data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always willing to share my data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to collaborate with me,
I'm wide open.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of that $53 billion, just five
countries make up the bulk of the demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: France, and this is based upon consumption
rates and then multiplying the number of
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers by a certain spend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so France is at the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it toggles between France,
Germany, and Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are the big three markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the UK is in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call them EU even though, probably
shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it could be, if you include some of
the other periphery countries in Europe,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Russia and the like, then there could
be as many as 84 million consumers in the
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm taking a little bit of a breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go into some of the data about
Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's roughly 4 million consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the conservative side, it could be as
many as 8 million consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in Germany, in a recent poll,
47% of the Germans supported legalization
[SPEAKER_02]: and 42% opposed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that could be the reason why
there's so few, relatively few,
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers when compared to the US,
Canada, Uruguay, and others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in order to support all of the demand
for products, regardless of the delivery
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanism, oils, flowers, and the like,
it would take about 948,000 kilos of
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivated output in order to support the
entire market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this looks at Europe in this chart,
7.8 million kilos of total demand in the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: 17 million pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for perspective, California produces
22 million pounds every year, even though
[SPEAKER_02]: about 18 million pounds of that is
exported outside of the state of
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the total addressable market,
total potential in Germany is 7.8 billion
[SPEAKER_02]: euros.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with greater social acceptance,
and increased usage rates, that could be
[SPEAKER_02]: as high as 15.6 billion euros.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for perspective, at 7.8 billion,
that's roughly the size of the Florida
[SPEAKER_02]: market or the New York market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not quite as big as California or
Texas, but it is Florida and New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those are sizeable markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida's ranked number two in the US,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of consumers, I mentioned this 4
million as many as 8 million.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the slide where I mentioned
the social clubs may actually limit growth
[SPEAKER_02]: in the near term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you only have 500 club members
per club, and you don't deploy as many
[SPEAKER_02]: clubs fast enough, if there's obstacles,
then you're not gonna get that legal
[SPEAKER_02]: growth, legal participation that people
are anticipating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I mentioned the total supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could go, the upper bound is around 2
million kilos.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this total supply isn't needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as regulations are deployed,
you need to kind of baby step.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to grow the supply as the demand
dictates it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of the common mistakes in
these jurisdictions, in these countries or
[SPEAKER_02]: states, provinces, is that they tend to
oversupply the market at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: They issue all the supply licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden, there's
oversupply.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not enough demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prices go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cultivators are left holding the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not making any money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the initial supply requirements in
year one, from what I see, is between 25
[SPEAKER_02]: and 50,000 kilos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, last year, I think Germany imported
30,000 kilos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think 13,000 went to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: through the pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's already a lot of supply,
and you're gonna add more in these
[SPEAKER_02]: suppliers domestically, then this is
really setting up for an oversupply
[SPEAKER_02]: situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So club openings, I thought that it'd be
interesting for people to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: understand my take on the number of clubs
and how they would roll out over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the first year, we're looking at 200
to 400 clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the policy is one club for every
6,000 residents.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not all cities are going to deploy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all cities are gonna have clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's gonna take time to ramp this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not uncommon in any new
jurisdiction where there's legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a while for the consumers to
participate and join into the legal
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes incentive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the government, the regulators,
the operators all need to incentivize,
[SPEAKER_02]: provide a reason for the consumers to
participate legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as they eventually do, then there'll
be more and more clubs required.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm not, this model has some ranges
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll know more about, and we'll be able
to predict this more precisely once we see
[SPEAKER_02]: the first year results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we have an anchor in terms of the
data for the first year, then it's very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very predictable afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll keep you up to date maybe next
year at the same conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like to talk about employment,
especially policymakers, because when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're adding jobs, when you're adding tax
revenue and the like, then that gives the
[SPEAKER_02]: politicians cover, it gives them
protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Against people that are more in favor of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're adding jobs, then that's a
good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the total potential market is worth
roughly 367,000 workers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're only gonna need four to 8,000
full-time equivalent workers in the legal
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the way it's set up in Germany is you
have all of these part-time workers in
[SPEAKER_02]: these clubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're only allowed to have a
certain number of hours or pay them a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain wage per month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the four to 8,000 workers is really
12 to 24,000 workers, part-time workers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just combine them all into one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for comparison, we just published a
report with a company called Vankst in the
[SPEAKER_02]: US, and it just came out, the report came
out last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we show that there were 400,000 to
140,000 legal workers in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just wanted to provide some
comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: The total market for employment in the
United States is about 1.5 to 1.6 million
[SPEAKER_02]: workers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you think about this, 360,000
workers, that's a lot of employment.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of economic impact that
cannabis has in these countries,
[SPEAKER_02]: in these communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why it's accelerating the
reform throughout the globe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in terms of opportunities,
there's some immediate opportunities and
[SPEAKER_02]: then some long-term opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the immediate term, cultivation,
software to track all this stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: CRM's customer resource management
software, you know, because you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: track your club members and like,
medical research.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the significant benefits to
the deployment of legal cannabis in
[SPEAKER_02]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And medical research is desperately
needed, more and more of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's other ancillary
businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you walk out in the exhibit hall,
you've got all these ancillary businesses
[SPEAKER_02]: from grow lights to, you know,
cooler dehumidifiers, easy for me to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got all these ancillary
businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's going to be a surge in
demand for these ancillary services.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you get in early, you can really set
yourself up for success in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are risks, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just you enter into a market and
all of a sudden you're printing money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's risk of oversupply.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's risks and delays in deployment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be tough to find a location because
of you know, certain jurisdiction
[SPEAKER_02]: restrictions like permitting and codes and
compliance and all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may be difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there may be other barriers to
entry that, you know, that go beyond the
[SPEAKER_02]: rules and regulations, you know,
access to capital and other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important to understand not only
the opportunities, but the risks when you
[SPEAKER_02]: enter into this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in terms of predictions,
I've just got a couple more slides and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take some questions if I have time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, expect an acceleration of
reform as a result of Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's bound to be a response from
the EU and the UN because does it violate
[SPEAKER_02]: certain parts of the international
treaties?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it not?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does the one country, if it's legal in
one country, it's legal in all in the EU
[SPEAKER_02]: policy?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that affect now that Germany has
entered into this space?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very compelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then look for certain restrictions or
barriers to get into these markets like
[SPEAKER_02]: requirement for certified seeds or GMP and
GAP EU GMP certifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are good things because they enable
the companies to track and trace and they
[SPEAKER_02]: do more discipline in their operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and this also is something that
North and South American and African
[SPEAKER_02]: suppliers should be aware of is that
that's a barrier to entry to get into the
[SPEAKER_02]: European space too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a trend towards GMP and GAP
certifications in South America,
[SPEAKER_02]: less so in the US, but definitely in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will differentiate who can
participate and who cannot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really important to be aware of
that and prepare for it in the future
[SPEAKER_02]: because it takes a little bit of time in
order to get those certifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I'm also mentioning in
addition to pharma being more of a pharma
[SPEAKER_02]: play and a medical play here in Europe,
but, you know, hemp will also become a
[SPEAKER_02]: major market in the EU.
[SPEAKER_02]: They already are and they have the
possibility of expanding if they have
[SPEAKER_02]: enough land and cultivation in order to
support.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so recommendations communicate,
talk to one another and go to conferences
[SPEAKER_02]: like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really critical to do that networking
and then get established in Germany or in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe, but in Germany initially so that
as the market opens up, you're already
[SPEAKER_02]: have a presence here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a US supplier manufacturer,
it's important to partner up with folks in
[SPEAKER_02]: this market and know your cost structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I've mentioned oversupply a lot
is it could lead to a deceleration in
[SPEAKER_02]: price and a decline in price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's a decline in price,
then it could put people out of business
[SPEAKER_02]: if they're not aware of what their cost
structure is all about and be prepared for
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's important to also use data,
right, to understand what the data is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to me, talk to anybody that has data
and make sure that you use data-driven
[SPEAKER_02]: decision making because cannabis can be
very emotional at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while, you know, cannabis is very
local, it's important to be aware of the
[SPEAKER_02]: global marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you act local, that's good
because you have to, but be sure to think
[SPEAKER_02]: globally because this is definitely a
trillion dollar global market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what I've got so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for your attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have one, a copy of my slides,
happy to provide them, just shoot me a
[SPEAKER_02]: note.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're ready for some- We're ready
for some questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Bo Whitney.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have three minutes, three minutes,
so that's like one or two questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently you have educated them
fully and they are all experts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Derek, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one question about the hemp where you
say that you think it'd be a big market in
[SPEAKER_01]: the EU as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: My impression is that in the States,
it's not going that well with the hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So could you expand a bit on that in two
and a half minutes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hey, if you can bring up my slides
just for a second, I've got some in backup
[SPEAKER_02]: that I can show and demonstrate the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the backup of my slides,
I talk a little bit about the modern uses
[SPEAKER_02]: of hemp, but then I also looked at these
various industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the hemp, you can make
construction material, automobile parts,
[SPEAKER_02]: textiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make EV batteries for cars.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make cutlery like my sister
company, Everyday Hemp Company does.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can feed this to animals and the like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even with just a small percentage
of market share capture by hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a half a trillion dollar market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you've got these traditional
industries and then you've got these
[SPEAKER_02]: industries that you can support and
transition over to a more environmentally
[SPEAKER_02]: and sustainable product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is what I'm talking about when
I say that there's a major opportunity in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is already in existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it needs nurturing and growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in countries where they have a
favorable hemp laws, you can look at what
[SPEAKER_02]: industries that they're currently have in
their country, like automotive,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can start building products
to substitute for existing traditional
[SPEAKER_02]: industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, 20% of BMWs are made with hemp parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so already that's on their website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they already have this sustainable
mandate in the EU.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this just, like I said, needs to be
expanded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when you compare it to the cannabis
market, total addressable market,
[SPEAKER_02]: 237 billion, you've got 500 billion for
hemp conservatively.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I say that there's these great
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just needs to, if you have a good
product, you have a vision and you follow
[SPEAKER_02]: through with it, there's tremendous upside
potential as well in this space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to ask a good question and get a bonus
slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way to go, Derek.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more question up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of picking back off of his comment of
how the US hemp market's not doing so
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stated that it probably would not be
best for regulators to bring hemp under
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, wouldn't that create an
unnecessary competition between the hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis industry, such in US
Florida's ban on hemp derived products?
[SPEAKER_00]: In your opinion, what would be a better
route?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going on in the United States is
that regulators are not sure what to do
[SPEAKER_02]: with hemp versus adult use of medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to bring it all under one
roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're focused on the intoxicating
cannabis cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're not really able or
qualified enough to look at the fiber
[SPEAKER_02]: market or qualified enough to look at the
food market, the animal feed, the human
[SPEAKER_02]: feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think in order to solve this,
they need to look and regulate at the
[SPEAKER_02]: product intention level and not if it's
hemp or marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you look at it at the product
intention level, if you have intoxicating
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be appropriate to be regulated
under a medical or a marijuana regulator.
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly roof tiles have no business
being regulated by a marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, there was an oversupply of
hemp in the United States, which led to a
[SPEAKER_02]: deceleration, a depression in pricing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people lost their businesses
as a result.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went out of business because of the
following prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people exited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now the hemp market in the United
States, 30,000 acres, I'm not sure what
[SPEAKER_02]: hectare that is, but 30,000 acres of
licensed capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look for that to actually grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually lower than it was five or
six years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's tremendous opportunities even
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just going to take a little bit
of investment and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: discipline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it comes to policymaking,
they need to be much more precise in their
[SPEAKER_02]: rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, they could have unintended
consequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in Florida, that's a multi-billion
dollar market for hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it generates thousands of jobs,
tens of thousands of jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you ban something without being
disciplined, then you're not going to meet
[SPEAKER_02]: your objectives for public safety,
public policy objectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to have all of this
displaced workers and other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bo Whitney, we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bo Whitney.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
