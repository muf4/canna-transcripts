[SPEAKER_07]: Well, hello everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great to be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you had a great morning and So our
panel today is mainstreaming of CBD So how
[SPEAKER_07]: does a product become a mainstream product
one might ask?
[SPEAKER_07]: it generally starts with the trend that in
the best case goes mainstream a
[SPEAKER_07]: particularly strong trend is a hype which
is the situation we have with CBD
[SPEAKER_07]: currently and But will the current CBD
hype turn into a sustainable consumer
trend?
[SPEAKER_07]: That is going to be one of the questions
we have for today, but before we delve
[SPEAKER_07]: into it The four panelists will introduce
themselves Chris, please I'm Chris you
[SPEAKER_02]: song vice president of marketing and
communications for elixir We are a
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado based company that also has
offices in Europe, Japan and Australia Hi,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Phil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm one of the founders and CEO of Khan
Amigo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our company is based in Austria At the
Lake Constance and we mainly produce
[SPEAKER_00]: high-quality CBD products and also grow
and sell hemp plants because in Austria
[SPEAKER_00]: it's basically legal to have every kind of
cannabis plant it doesn't matter if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD or THC genetic and This is what we
basically do Hello everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Roman Dobryna.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm chief business development officer at
company pharma hemp Pharma hemp is company
[SPEAKER_03]: from Ljubljana, Slovenia We we say for our
company that we control from the seats
[SPEAKER_03]: fills to the final consumer products And
we are considered to be one of the most
[SPEAKER_03]: innovative company in developing health
care products based on CBD Hello,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Kai, Kai Nieman from Paderborn,
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a lawyer I'm in the field since two
years and I'm consulting CBD and medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis companies in all regulatory and
legal issues Well, that was great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's delve right into it then so So CBD
is taking the world by storm, but one has
[SPEAKER_07]: to ask the question Who is the consumer
behind this demand?
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris?
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a typical CBD consumer out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is probably the hardest question of
the afternoon because our demographic is
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody eight to eighty Any mammal almost
right that can take CBD right because they
[SPEAKER_02]: all have an endocannabinoid system So is
the who is the average consumer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone with an endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we have to develop individual
products that speak to those individual
[SPEAKER_02]: needs in those individual voices So it's
more in the delivery system the marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: and the messaging that we're able to fit
those individual needs From a European
[SPEAKER_07]: perspective Roman and Philip would you
agree?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I will agree because there's no
typical CBD consumer everybody buys it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we regulate ourselves to sell the
products at 18 but from from 18 to 80 you
[SPEAKER_00]: have everybody the younger people maybe
buy it for muscle regeneration or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the guys come for Royma and also
dog snacks and and these things are sold
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's a very bright bright consumer
Roman do you have anything to add?
[SPEAKER_03]: Our experience is actually the same
because but what we were a bit surprised
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our internet portals sell us and
we were measuring some aging So it is only
[SPEAKER_03]: two percent ourselves, but our average
consumer was 35 years old which was to me
[SPEAKER_07]: surprisingly young So we have all these
consumer types all these different
[SPEAKER_07]: products new product developments are
rapidly increasing So let's take a step
[SPEAKER_07]: back.
[SPEAKER_07]: How would you cut carrot and categorize
it?
[SPEAKER_07]: How would you give a beginner-friendly
take on all this?
[SPEAKER_07]: These products which categories do we have
maybe Philip or Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how Chris told before it's more a
thing for from marketing because It
[SPEAKER_00]: depends to the customer We also have the
granny's which comes in and you think
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the capsules or the oil are the best
for her But she's asking for flowers for
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking this also can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think how he said you should place in
the Development some products for
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of consumers, but you
never can say that this is fixed So we
[SPEAKER_02]: focus on delivery systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure you get the most
amount of high quality CBD for the high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality people We use a liposomal product
to make sure that it you feel the effects
[SPEAKER_02]: really fast for those that need those
Right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a topical for those that want to
put it on that way We have capsules
[SPEAKER_02]: because people are just used to taking
pills, you know We want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: you develop the way and the delivery
System that you're gonna get the most
[SPEAKER_07]: impact in the way that you'll take it If
you look at the production method and all
[SPEAKER_07]: these different types of Intakes what you
can have with CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have to think then I'm gonna
produce it like this to this mean or Does
[SPEAKER_07]: it not matter in any case maybe Roman?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have different sort of production
depending on our final product for
[SPEAKER_03]: example, I don't know we are now stressing
for example creams with a glucose amine
[SPEAKER_03]: for the joints and now this is special
technique is all the recipe and then we
[SPEAKER_03]: have special I would say co-partner with
the GMP facilities So, you know each
[SPEAKER_03]: product is a bit unique and what we learn
for is also with all the consumer products
[SPEAKER_03]: Stability studies are quite demanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to be really I would say
focusing and really Takes time.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not that easy So the demand we heard
is rapidly increasing at which rate is it
[SPEAKER_07]: increasing would be my first question and
also Is it possible to meet this demand as
[SPEAKER_07]: a single supplier?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, obviously we have a US perspective
and a Europeans perspective on this but
[SPEAKER_07]: can you give any?
[SPEAKER_07]: Insight to how rapid this demand is I can
see Roman I mean I can tell in our case
[SPEAKER_03]: our company last year grew times three
almost times four Of course with new
[SPEAKER_03]: categories new lines and coping with this
is you know managing your working capital
[SPEAKER_03]: Having the right capacities well planned
For us is also important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say traceability continuity So we
retrace each product so and building this
[SPEAKER_03]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it takes really all the resources of
the company Because you know you can do if
[SPEAKER_03]: you do something fast you can do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was our experience So we're a global
company and we're delivered to 42
[SPEAKER_02]: different countries So our perspective
globally is that we've secured source for
[SPEAKER_02]: five to six times our Growth from last
year, which was five to six times the year
[SPEAKER_02]: before so we're absolutely looking to be
able to supply the increase in demand that
[SPEAKER_02]: seems By best aspects everyone's saying
somewhere between 16 and 20 million in the
[SPEAKER_02]: next three years is billion in the next 23
years, which is an Inimaginable number
[SPEAKER_02]: when you realize that just last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only a billion right and I feel
weird saying only a billion but 22 billion
[SPEAKER_02]: is a lot bigger than that So everyone has
to scale and everybody has to grow and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's why everybody in this room has an
opportunity to really be a part of that
[SPEAKER_07]: Philip have you got anything to add from
your perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say the demand is rising up very
fast It's also I think because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: media the TV and so on because the people
get informed about cannabis again it's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming back through to the humans and also
the guys talk to each other and we see a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of times the customers come in our
shop and they are Informed before because
[SPEAKER_00]: we are not allowed to give some health
claims or anything the CBD But they know
[SPEAKER_00]: it before they come so you see about the
internet the media Or anywhere they hear
[SPEAKER_00]: about and they want to try it and eight
from ten come again and buy again So this
[SPEAKER_00]: is a nice rate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe also a question for you directly now
Phillips So you have you the demand is
[SPEAKER_07]: increasing in a fast race.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're still a start-up if I may say a
small company How does your company deal
[SPEAKER_07]: with the fast-moving nature?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're such a small company,
what do you focus on?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean sudden increase in demand and also
the regulatory obstacles will put on
[SPEAKER_07]: Workload onto your table.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you deal with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to make a good
product line for yourself To see that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can give for every kind of person
something special, but I think there are
[SPEAKER_00]: so many Products that the people are often
overloaded They don't know what they what
[SPEAKER_00]: they should buy because they are not from
this topic They are not out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry or they haven't been
smokers before So they come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes they overloaded with different
oil concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, okay Should it take to 5% to 10%
to 20%?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's important to hold the
product line small and good and so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: can have something for anybody and Build a
good network is also important for the for
[SPEAKER_00]: the b2b and so you're able to deliver
nearly everything Roman what's your take
[SPEAKER_07]: on this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would agree with my colleague on my
right about the consumers I think what is
[SPEAKER_03]: unique in this business and we've been in
business for 30 years that actually I've
[SPEAKER_03]: never met so well educated consumers They
study they study the the stuff on the net.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very educated and they're very
loyal So this will be my point that if you
[SPEAKER_03]: deliver the right really what you say
Consumers will stay with you Okay,
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris, how do you see it from your
perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I believe we are dealing with a more
educated client than we were dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: five years ago or six years ago and
absolutely we're learning and learning to
[SPEAKER_02]: Help feed the need that those educated
buyers have but I think the bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity is those that have no idea
what CBD is I have no idea what cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: is never heard of an endocannabinoid
system and are just looking to feel better
[SPEAKER_02]: to Meet a need that they have and what
we're doing is working on our messaging
[SPEAKER_02]: and our packaging to Just offer that,
you know, I want to sleep better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to feel better I want to get rid of
inflammation I want to get rid of pain and
[SPEAKER_02]: then create a product that says that we
don't I think one of the challenging
[SPEAKER_02]: things in our industry is that there's a
certain segment of our clients that want
[SPEAKER_02]: to know the percentage and the genealogy
and the seeds and where it was grown and
[SPEAKER_02]: others just want to know Is it good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it gonna help me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can I get it and we have to be able
to speak to both those type of clients?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it already came through in some of the
answers and now we're moving on to the
[SPEAKER_07]: regulatory question of this panel Kai
you're gonna be up in a sec But basically
[SPEAKER_07]: so we have hindrances for example not
being able to talk about it health claim
[SPEAKER_07]: issues and so forth and Which registration
is important in this context?
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you say Kai?
[SPEAKER_07]: What what's the whole?
[SPEAKER_07]: Homework that has to be done when selling
a CBD product Yeah, first you the most
[SPEAKER_01]: common product we have at the moment is
the the supplement so it's a Supplement to
[SPEAKER_01]: your normal diet and it's labeled as a
supplement then you have to notify your
[SPEAKER_01]: product in the supplement register and You
have to label it correctly due to the EU
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement directives and you have to give
notice that it's out of reach of children
[SPEAKER_01]: and You have to have you have to name the
the main ingredient And you have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that pretty correctly and then you can
sell it as a supplement The the other way
[SPEAKER_01]: is so the other the problem is that you
can't make a health claim That's I think
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the biggest problem for the
industry Because if you have a nice brand
[SPEAKER_01]: in a nice shop and the consumer comes in
and ask what this for I can't tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't make sense, you know So in
the in the future the companies have to
[SPEAKER_01]: work on on that and the EU legal framework
offers two options you can apply to Get
[SPEAKER_01]: into the EU health claims catalog or you
can register your product as a traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: herbal medicine Then you of course have to
prove the The effects or the health claims
[SPEAKER_01]: you you want to make you have to some
research some study some database on that
[SPEAKER_01]: To to to be able to register it as some
kind of this product So hearing that
[SPEAKER_07]: wouldn't it basically make more sense to
go the Pharmaceutical route so you are
[SPEAKER_07]: able to talk about it to the consumer also
thinking about the consumers interest in
[SPEAKER_07]: Transparency in this context.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wouldn't that what's all your opinions on
that question?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean if you make if you make a health
claim and even If you if someone else
[SPEAKER_01]: makes a health claim for you on your
product You are in danger that you your
[SPEAKER_01]: product will be deemed as a Medicine
according to the medicine act like a
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation medicine presentations at
nine metal and yeah, that's that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the risk you you you and you if you have
if you want to become a real medicine like
[SPEAKER_01]: according to the AMG the medicine law then
This is very complicated this cost lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: monies clinical studies trials placebo
double-blind Etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's over-the-top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think because it's just a supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just It's intended for homo stasis
for being balanced and not for curing
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases So we have to have you have to
work find a workaround in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay Yeah, I don't think it's as
complicated as that I think that it gets
[SPEAKER_02]: more complicated Because people want to
make claims because they want to tell you
[SPEAKER_02]: all the amazing things that they felt that
this this plant and this product has done
[SPEAKER_02]: but the reason CBD works is because it
gives the information to your body to help
[SPEAKER_02]: it heal itself and if we just explain to
people that this aids in the relief of
[SPEAKER_02]: temporary sleeplessness this Supports you
being able to have less inflammation your
[SPEAKER_02]: body if you use the right vocabulary in
the right words as the guidelines of the
[SPEAKER_02]: different regulatory board Bodies in each
individual country.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy where it becomes hard is when
people say it cures this My dog now walks
[SPEAKER_02]: right those type of things are you don't
you and that's the challenge and we're one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the only major CBD companies that has
not received a warning letter from the FDA
[SPEAKER_02]: in the United States because we follow
those guidelines 100% and it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: important that we do that and as an
industry and as a community that we
[SPEAKER_02]: support companies that do that and we
don't follow the Easy route the temporary
[SPEAKER_02]: route of a quick sale because we want to
say this one thing And if we just learn
[SPEAKER_02]: the education and learn the way to say it,
it's it's a lot simpler Roman do you have
[SPEAKER_07]: anything to add?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we we don't use claims as you know,
we sell cosmetic products We have the
[SPEAKER_03]: plans to upgrade to some medical device
which you need some studies But this is
[SPEAKER_03]: back to the point, you know, we should
consumers are educated, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they do study so I think that We should
just the I would say guide them Educate
[SPEAKER_03]: them, you know was calling have mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the right way We should not say
we should not use hard work words,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we know how you know Europe is very
precise in this actually So let's get a
[SPEAKER_07]: bit more specific on that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: So best practice you you selling it,
but you're not allowed to talk about it
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you do it Philip?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very good question It's how I
told you before the most people come
[SPEAKER_00]: already informed to the shop but for sure
a lot of times the people come in and and
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell you about their issues and if it
helps or not But you have to say you can
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot give any answers for this because
you are not allowed you're not a pharmacy
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not a doctor You can try it for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what you can say maybe some other
consumers or customers Already have an
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with the same topic and they
talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also an Possibility But the people
understand it when you say you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to to inform about some health
claims or anything They understand it and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just try it and when they try it they
come back How do these consumers educate
[SPEAKER_07]: themselves outside of your shop?
[SPEAKER_07]: So they come educated who how do they get
the information?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have any idea on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can find a lot of in the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem in the internet is that There
are a lot of informations which are not
[SPEAKER_00]: founded just Opinions and and and and this
is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so we need more official websites
official Organizations where the people
[SPEAKER_07]: can inform by themselves Okay,
anybody anything to add so let's address
[SPEAKER_07]: the specific topic novel food in this
context because it's been in the media a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot in recent weeks How do you guys live
with the news?
[SPEAKER_07]: The novel foods regulation at this point,
maybe it's the same with the FDA approval
[SPEAKER_07]: that stands in the room How do you go
about this Chris?
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe from the FDA perspective,
please?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the FDA in the United States and the
novel foods here in Europe is different
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory boards run those and we're
working closely with each one of those to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that we already meet all of the
guidelines for those in our manufacturing
[SPEAKER_02]: and distribution and testing processes and
we're working with them to make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: When available will be ready to get those
certifications, but until that point
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody said we can't move forward So we're
acting business as usual and as they ask
[SPEAKER_02]: for more information about our products
more information about the industry We're
[SPEAKER_02]: providing those we're working with lobby
groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working with industrial and industry
groups in 42 different countries to be
[SPEAKER_07]: able to do so Kai from a legal
perspective.
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you recommend companies in
regard to novel food?
[SPEAKER_07]: How would you what would you say to them
if they want to?
[SPEAKER_07]: Set up a business now on CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have seen a lot of New
developments in the last month regarding
[SPEAKER_01]: noble food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started in Austria as the Ministry of
Health in Austria Advised the governor's
[SPEAKER_01]: to enforce the noble food regulation and
then there must have been some discussions
[SPEAKER_01]: on bilateral political In Brussels and
they decided in January to change the
[SPEAKER_01]: noble food catalog Before that it was if
the percentage of CBD is higher than in
[SPEAKER_01]: the original plan So it's this left room
for interpretation and nowadays it is all
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts from from from all cannabinoids
extracts extracts are a noble food So what
[SPEAKER_01]: is what is an extract?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what's the definition?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the interpretation of an of an
extract?
[SPEAKER_01]: and then You can yeah, you need a solvent
if you if your extract some some solvent
[SPEAKER_01]: method or some some solvent stuff And then
you start the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still as I learned it's still Whole
plant then but you change the percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you enrich and you You yeah,
you you make you you Make it more from
[SPEAKER_01]: from the stuff you want and you you get
the stuff out You don't want and and this
[SPEAKER_01]: point you are in the noble food Directive
the noble food directive is applicable to
[SPEAKER_01]: your to your product So and we see that in
the BVL just next door is the food
[SPEAKER_01]: authority of Germany it's they Published
in a new entry on the web page where they
[SPEAKER_01]: expressively say if you enrich Your
product with a CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's noble food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I don't know what's going to
happen the next six nine month We saw the
[SPEAKER_01]: example in Austria the Ministry of Health
and instructing the governor's to enforce
[SPEAKER_01]: the noble food directive You can read it
in on the food safety authority in Ireland
[SPEAKER_01]: on the web page if we get to know cases of
Extracts of products using extracts that
[SPEAKER_01]: we will go after them But they also say
and this is yeah the bottom line I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: right now which also I have published In
his paper in their paper if you find a
[SPEAKER_01]: method Which which allows you that you
have the full plant and you don't you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't enrich Something like like a cold
press like a traditional Manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: practice you on the safe side and you can
use that product but what I've learned
[SPEAKER_01]: also is that companies don't like that
because the Oil which uses extracts is
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to use Consumer-friendly or people
like it more to use it's it's not as dark
[SPEAKER_01]: and a sticky and it's it just looks nicer
And it's not as complicated to use a cold
[SPEAKER_01]: press method So yeah, but the future will
I think we will have some some some
[SPEAKER_01]: developments in the next near future on
how the authorities react on that problem
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe Philip and Roman a question for
you next so we have these regulatory
[SPEAKER_07]: obstacles What do you do when you get
confronted with a new situation?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have workarounds for this?
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we have workarounds at first step in
Austria it happened at first There we had
[SPEAKER_00]: to change quickly the declaration Just as
a flavor product again How it was before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some years ago, but this is just just a
short perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think You have to change the process of
the of the producing for the for the
[SPEAKER_00]: longer time frame, but also we have an
exciting eye to the to the EU regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: in this market because I think how young
said it's about six nine six to nine
[SPEAKER_00]: months and we will know more and till this
time we have to To have workarounds how we
[SPEAKER_00]: say it and there are different ways to do
it different declaration different
[SPEAKER_00]: declaration cold pressed stuff And these
things yeah, this is the same like in the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole market You have to stay very
flexible at the moment because there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: good regulation Roman This novel food
situation actually has been the same
[SPEAKER_03]: almost for year and a half It's about the
execution of the null food how you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we were aware of this a year ago So
simply we do not claim on the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are food supplement because then you
know food so there ways how to avoid You
[SPEAKER_03]: know you can market some products as a
topic loose as a cosmetics and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: You have sometimes vitamin C which you put
on the skin or you put belong the tongue
[SPEAKER_03]: You know is very this is how we do it and
in some cases, you know, we have purely
[SPEAKER_03]: cosmetic products creams Which are in CP&P
portal so we know it's it's a cosmetic
[SPEAKER_03]: product So it's not only you know,
you have we have many products.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not have only food supplement Has
anybody applied for the novel food
[SPEAKER_07]: Regulation yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not but we know there were one of
the first companies more than a year ago
[SPEAKER_03]: was one check company We know this was in
from March last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is a quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want It's from 2016 and they even
haven't passed the first stage They which
[SPEAKER_01]: means they couldn't provide the toxic look
a toxicological survey That the product
[SPEAKER_07]: isn't harmful to the consumer So we heard
from Chris Chris is in dialogue with the
[SPEAKER_07]: FDA in dialogue with the regulatory bodies
Now from a Europeans perspective,
[SPEAKER_07]: we all know the European Industrial Hemp
Association was at the EU Commission
[SPEAKER_07]: recently People are trying to find a
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at the media though,
it sometimes seems us and them How should
[SPEAKER_07]: the industry take action against These
oxen obstacles in your opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: How should the industry organize
themselves to make the product?
[SPEAKER_07]: accessible to a wider consumer Range
sorry, I Know about the European
[SPEAKER_03]: Industrial Hemp Association, you know,
they do efforts lobbying that you know
[SPEAKER_03]: this would pass and that Cannabinoids
would not be a novel food art and certain
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams per day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We fully support this and I think that
They've been quite successful But I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: a regulatory person.
[SPEAKER_03]: This would be the only common from this
side Okay, what's your opinion?
[SPEAKER_07]: How should one organize oneself?
[SPEAKER_01]: I suggest some decent litigation on this
so That you you can you can continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute your products the authorities
would have to issue a distribution ban a
[SPEAKER_01]: really official distribution ban and you
can take legal remedies against this
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution ban and They can only Issue
immediate enforcement so that you really
[SPEAKER_01]: have to stop to sell these products just
in case of a danger of the consumer and As
[SPEAKER_01]: we know CBD is has a good safety profile
the World Health Organization published
[SPEAKER_01]: the CBD report last June and They found
out that there are no side effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave people over three months 300
milligram to 400 milligram per day and no
[SPEAKER_01]: side effects showed showed up so this
can't be an argument so you can distribute
[SPEAKER_01]: your products till the end of the To the
to the final legal decision and that maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: can take three four or five years Yeah,
so I think this will be This will be
[SPEAKER_01]: sorted out about litigation if the if the
companies doesn't Down the novel food
[SPEAKER_01]: Directive doesn't stop the companies then
it has to go to court Well, if you look to
[SPEAKER_07]: the UK still Europe UK Cannabis Trades
Association is instructing a law firm to
[SPEAKER_07]: go and take action Chris, do you think
that's the right approach to instruct a
[SPEAKER_07]: law firm to take action?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do you think it should be more?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know a nice dialogue on that Area
well, I know for us We work with the
[SPEAKER_02]: European Hemp Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with the cannabis Associations,
we work with the US Hemp Authority.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with just about any trading
association out there because we know that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not enough being done right,
so whether It's legal action whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: lobbying whether it's going to your
different political Representative and
[SPEAKER_02]: knock it on their door.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think more of that has to happen I think
we all have to internally regulate
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves and we have to internally
cooperate and help make sure that the
[SPEAKER_02]: People that play well together do well and
the people that are trying to force their
[SPEAKER_02]: own agenda don't That's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now in the description of the panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was also The competition from Big
Pharma was in there is do you have
[SPEAKER_07]: competition by Big Pharma?
[SPEAKER_07]: And how does it reflect on your daily
business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with Philip maybe here At the
moment I cannot say that we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: competition with the Big Pharma because
the reason why people buy these products
[SPEAKER_00]: is to go away from the Big Pharma to go
back more to nature and to natural
[SPEAKER_00]: producers So when we produce it in
Austria, we have our hemp fields and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all organic grown and the people know it
and it's transparent I think they like to
[SPEAKER_00]: get more such a product than final
medicine from the pharmacy But it's up to
[SPEAKER_07]: the type of customer also Roman do you
have Big Pharma as a threat?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't we don't see them as a threat I
think this could be opportunity because
[SPEAKER_03]: they will focus on some other aspects
where we We cannot compete and we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to compete with them We have an
experience where we ready cooperate with
[SPEAKER_03]: fight of farmer producer fairly big one so
we can work together Chris how is it from
[SPEAKER_02]: a US perspective I Think globally that any
pharmaceutical company that wants to come
[SPEAKER_02]: into the market is only going to help
educate Help normalize and help get more
[SPEAKER_02]: people using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm currently Epidiolex is a $32,000 a
year pharmaceutical I don't feel any
[SPEAKER_02]: competition from somebody that's gonna
sell at that high level and be a you know
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically a pharmaceutical drug like to
his point people are looking for natural
[SPEAKER_02]: alternatives to give their body the
information to heal itself They're not
[SPEAKER_07]: looking for another opioid Now to take a
step back from a wave maybe from the
[SPEAKER_07]: regulatory topics so the panel is called
mainstreaming of CBD now, it's just a very
[SPEAKER_07]: obvious question.
[SPEAKER_07]: But still what is your outlook on this?
[SPEAKER_07]: How with the market develop will CBD
become a mainstream develop a product in
[SPEAKER_07]: your eyes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, it has to It's one of the most
innovative most effective things that's
[SPEAKER_02]: come out In history, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been around forever and we're just
now starting to realize the effects of it
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, you know to those that
discovered the endocannabinoid system and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know all the people that have been
pushing the cannabis agenda for decades
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're all standing on their shoulders
and I appreciate all the work and fighting
[SPEAKER_02]: that they've done to show the medical
benefits of the cannabis plant and now
[SPEAKER_02]: it's only getting to the point where it's
normalizing where people just it makes No
[SPEAKER_02]: sense that this isn't the same as craft
beer because right now, you know Just
[SPEAKER_02]: imagine if craft beer came out as a trend
At the same time prohibition ended Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what this is right our new
craft beer is coming out exactly when
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition ended and it's gonna be normal
and everybody's gonna take it and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna grow it in your own backyard and
you're gonna make it and you're gonna buy
[SPEAKER_02]: it at your own grocery store and you're
gonna buy it from your doctor and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna have all sorts of different flavors
and fine ways to get it and it's just
[SPEAKER_07]: gonna be completely Normal, how will the
intake be Chris will be sipping or smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD whichever way you want For me,
I love the topicals and our liposomal
[SPEAKER_02]: product because it just works so fast
Because we have Martha Stewart apparently
[SPEAKER_07]: doing some developments jelly beans CBD is
in the air all these news flash has been
[SPEAKER_02]: about I appreciate I appreciate again
people looking for innovative ways to take
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD and and I'm sure my my fellow
panelists have some input on this and You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, I love that Martha Stewart is
bringing this more normal, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But we all know that a jelly beans not a
great way to take something that's gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: help your body Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's a fun recreational way to take
some other things, but CBD is probably not
[SPEAKER_02]: the best in my opinion I agree with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We directly see it with our customers
because it's not just a trend I think
[SPEAKER_00]: because they come one time to try it but
they come again and they say eight from
[SPEAKER_00]: ten Come again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it will normalize how you
say in Europe not so much people know
[SPEAKER_00]: about CBD now, but You see the market is
running and it's growing very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it will normalize We just will
see how the how the regulation will happen
[SPEAKER_03]: Roman and that cannabis was called one
million plant back in the history because
[SPEAKER_03]: you know We started to make ropes for the
sailing then the food and each part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant was used CBD just on top of this I
think is a revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this process cannot be stopped I
think that Regulating would help us as
[SPEAKER_03]: well organized producer because what we
found out a lot of I would say producers
[SPEAKER_03]: which are now not consistent which are not
fair to the consumers, but I think sky's
[SPEAKER_03]: the limit and we just go should work
together and Yeah focus in the future
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, one and anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you think the market will develop
from a legal point of view maybe as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the the interesting question will be
how the authorities will deal with the
[SPEAKER_01]: noble food Directive in the next six to
twelve month We haven't seen any I know
[SPEAKER_01]: real cases on distribution bands or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to CBD sample imports which were
stopped at the customs at Karlsruhe one
[SPEAKER_01]: with the with the with the reasoning that
CBD is medicine and the import license
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't there so then they Examine the
product and realized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's only it's only a 30 30 milligram
daily intake So it's not relevant for
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacological effect and they stopped
the proceeding and the other sample they
[SPEAKER_01]: had health claims So they could say ah,
it's it's a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a presentation medicine and we keep
it we So this is the only two cases I had
[SPEAKER_01]: but it will be interesting would be Yeah
You have to see what what's going on the
[SPEAKER_01]: next 12 month.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be an interesting period Well,
I'm not quite sure where we are on time
[SPEAKER_08]: You are very close.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have time for a couple of moments How
are you let's hear for the panel,
[SPEAKER_07]: okay, thank you for your attention We have
time for maybe two questions one or two
[SPEAKER_08]: questions one or two anybody have a
question brief question No, I have a
[SPEAKER_08]: question.
[SPEAKER_08]: What?
[SPEAKER_08]: What isn't gonna be full of CBD like you
could put CBD in a cream and a soap and a
[SPEAKER_08]: can we have CBD infused strawberries or
chickens or beef jerky or coffee like
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the limit?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it gonna be in everything?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just gonna put it in the water.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we gonna do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on I hope that you folk that we
continue to focus on a high quality
[SPEAKER_02]: delivery system So that it's bioavailable
and people actually get the effects of it
[SPEAKER_02]: and it just doesn't pass through our body
I think it's very important that we
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to focus on full spectrum oils
and Really look at the science of bio
[SPEAKER_02]: accessibility and bio viability.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that will direct what we put it in I
have a comment to Kai I would never ever
[SPEAKER_05]: expect that you will be able to register
traditional herbal medicine the product
[SPEAKER_05]: with cannabis This is impossible because
you need a 30 years of tradition and you
[SPEAKER_05]: will never prove it I was involved in over
100 applications of registrations and This
[SPEAKER_05]: is not the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not possible
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why there's an exception in these
paragraphs, but you don't need 30 years
[SPEAKER_01]: and Not necessarily you need 30 years at
least at least you need 15 in the you and
[SPEAKER_05]: even this 15 need to be Connected to an
indication and an illness and both is not
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Don't think you can say that I Don't
think you can say that there that I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think you can say CBD is not connected to
an indication for more than 10 or 15 years
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you So we actually I'm wondering I
feel that CBD is super popular in a
[SPEAKER_06]: certain Goop going as Paltrow lifestyle
world because I keep reading only in that
[SPEAKER_06]: context about CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why do you guys?
[SPEAKER_06]: think that is Why do you think it's
popular with because I mean I personally
[SPEAKER_06]: but well she told me no No, I mean,
sorry to be more precise.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel it's very popular in this world
around lifestyle yoga consciousness
[SPEAKER_06]: Fashion even so kale.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you For me what I've what I found is
that people are looking for alternatives
[SPEAKER_02]: and that group that market share is
looking for alternatives They don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to buy pharmaceuticals anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to biohack.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to neurohack.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to improve their lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to Invest in their health not
their sickness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why they're making these
decisions and that's why they're moving
[SPEAKER_02]: forward and that's why things like Gwyneth
Paltrow and I think just recently Justin
[SPEAKER_02]: Timber Justin Bieber's wife was talking
about it and you know, it's all over the
[SPEAKER_02]: place, right and yeah, it's not I don't
think one of the Kardashians have talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about it, but still it's overall overall
CBD Is is moving into the health and
[SPEAKER_02]: wellness space which is much bigger and
much more impactful than dealing with
[SPEAKER_00]: indications Yeah, and I think the trend is
basically going back to the nature stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just think that these kind of people
when I can say it like to support support
[SPEAKER_00]: this trend and this is why it happens Is
there a way to ensure that you're getting
[SPEAKER_08]: quality CBD?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean because now you look everywhere you
see CBD CBD that is it hemp derived?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it made in a vat like how do you know
that you're getting bioavailable or good
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff or quality?
[SPEAKER_08]: You just see they just it's almost like
they just throw three letters on a package
[SPEAKER_08]: and expect you to believe it Like how can
people figure out what's good?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that is happening I haven't seen
any of that in this room or this community
[SPEAKER_02]: But absolutely There are people that are
using CBD as a marketing term like they
[SPEAKER_02]: did acai berries way back in the day and
CBD is much more than a movement or a fad
[SPEAKER_02]: like that and it's more like the new aloe
vera And it's gonna be in a lot of things
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's gonna be there and you had
definitely want to know the quality and
[SPEAKER_02]: where it came from Most of the companies
up here All of them provide their
[SPEAKER_02]: certificates of analysis online so that
you can see the high quality that's
[SPEAKER_02]: available there and additionally you can
read about it and see who's participating
[SPEAKER_02]: in these different organizations to move
it forward that are participating with
[SPEAKER_08]: groups like this and where's all of this
being grown like is it all hemp derived is
[SPEAKER_08]: it all being grown somewhere or Yeah,
I mean you you don't have to tell me no I
[SPEAKER_03]: just this is what we do as a company No,
we as I mentioned at the beginning we
[SPEAKER_03]: control from the field seats of the final
product We offer fruit transparency,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know certificate of analysis msds
whatever you call it and This is this how
[SPEAKER_03]: it works on the long term Because you can
find the products with the CBD tag on but
[SPEAKER_03]: if once you analyze You will find hardly a
trace of CBD these things are happening
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have farms throughout Europe and in
the United States we grow in both places
[SPEAKER_08]: and we're growing hemp That was my next
question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think that there's gonna be like a
huge global?
[SPEAKER_08]: expansion of CBD hemp and maybe like
Portugal or Macedonia or some of these not
[SPEAKER_02]: just Canada I think every third question I
got here is I'm growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to buy it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So absolutely people are growing it all
over the place I think the challenge is
[SPEAKER_02]: because hemp is such an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes all the amazing things out of the
ground that It does really good things for
[SPEAKER_02]: you But also if you don't grow it in the
right place, it takes all the crap out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the ground It brings it right into you So
you have to really be careful of where
[SPEAKER_02]: that source is coming from and where
you're getting there and and back to the
[SPEAKER_03]: sorry No, hemp now is being used in
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: We build houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's used in automotive industry I don't
there was a study what hemp does for
[SPEAKER_03]: environment, you know 15 tons of carbon
monoxide Per year is cleaned by one
[SPEAKER_03]: hectare of hemp, you know, I mean these
are these this is public data So we should
[SPEAKER_03]: support hemp on all aspects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only because of the CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good point We have time for one
more question and then we're gonna move on
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everybody So my question is around
when we're talking about CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're really talking about the flower that
does not have The THC in it a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: times.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not specifically Only focused on on
the CBD There's also a lot of other
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids that are not mentioned that
are included in those in those in these
[SPEAKER_04]: full spectrum extracts that we're talking
about Yeah, so with cannabis there's
[SPEAKER_04]: there's very specific effects that you'll
find with various strains my question is
[SPEAKER_04]: really around the idea of strain hunting
in the CBD market and what are the I just
[SPEAKER_04]: anecdotes on that topic seem like a really
interesting area of discussion I just can
[SPEAKER_03]: say that Europe is much different than the
US because you have control strains and
[SPEAKER_03]: the seats and I think Europe is not
competitive here with Switzerland and US
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think this could be potentially
problem a problem in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Yes, this is this is the thing that we
have a catalog of strains which we can we
[SPEAKER_00]: are allowed to use and Some countries you
have the chance to select out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, but in another country is not so in
Germany for sure Not you're just allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring out the seeds and harvest what
you got All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear it for our panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry to have time But I'm sure you
can talk to them in the hallway that was
[SPEAKER_08]: fantastic Philip Rebecca Roman Chris and
hi
