[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Claudia de la Mora.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a managing director of Black Legion
Capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in M&A and invested in being
keen all my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from Maryland and cover several
industries so far from hospitality to
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer products, oil and gas,
natural resources and finally cannabis in
[SPEAKER_05]: the past seven years and based in Los
Angeles, California.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to introduce the panelists
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Markus Moser based in Germany,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: His partner at Zurich und Moser
Consulting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So consulting firm, advisory based in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is focusing also in different
industries and he comes from natural
[SPEAKER_05]: resources mining, but in the past few
years has been focusing into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: industry in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we have David Traylor, Golden Eagle
Partners, managing director of Golden
[SPEAKER_05]: Eagle Partners, a consulting advisory
service group as well focusing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally we have Jamie Pearson,
president CEO of Bank.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this panel is comprised of three
advisory investing banking consulting
[SPEAKER_05]: people and an entrepreneur CEO of a
multi-state operator of early integrated
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis company in North America.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are the differences between U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: and global strategies for investment and
operations?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start from Moser.
[SPEAKER_05]: Moser, can you tell us a little bit,
you know, your point of view on
[SPEAKER_05]: differences and similarities between U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: or North American, you know, Canada as
well and European companies in their
[SPEAKER_05]: operations strategies?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think first of all if you look at U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: they are frontrunners in the sector and
the companies are much larger than in
[SPEAKER_04]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of companies acting globally.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Europe most companies are just acting
in their countries because it's a bit,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, a very fragmented sector in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to elaborate on that, why do you
think North American companies are acting
[SPEAKER_05]: internationally versus, you know,
differently from European companies?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are they acting more domestically?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think first of all they have much more
money because the money markets in North
[SPEAKER_04]: America, especially in U.S., also Canada,
are much larger.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have a lot of cash funds to invest
abroad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course they invested, you know,
too much money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they lost a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the stock market,
if you look at, you know, the listed
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis companies, the stock went down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Market cap went down because I think they
invested, I would say, not smart the money
[SPEAKER_04]: they got.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually I'm going to jump to Jamie here
because I know, you know, I have
[SPEAKER_05]: background.
[SPEAKER_05]: So based on what Moser just said,
right, Marcus?
[SPEAKER_04]: Marcus.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's saying that the reason why North
American companies are going
[SPEAKER_05]: internationally is because they have more
money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you agree with that in terms of,
you know, is there like a growth problem
[SPEAKER_05]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what, and I don't think you're
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, I think there's more to the
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the piece that I would add to
that, a couple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, let's take the publicly listed
company, Trulieve, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their market cap's down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're trading around $12 when
they normally operate around $28.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were around a $10 billion market cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think now they're at like $2.5 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, they've put up 18 profitable
quarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've continued to exceed analyst
expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not because they're making bad
decisions that their market cap's low.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said in my keynote, the entire sector
is down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that you can say that
American companies are making bad
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, cannabis, you're swimming
upstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are operating in prohibition and
capital is not easy to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter what continent you're on
because there is a stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I will say is you can run a
fantastic company right now and your
[SPEAKER_00]: market cap's gonna be in the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the reality of the world that
we live in right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to answer your question,
why are US companies looking to come to
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a burgeoning market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to see the, you know,
playing out of what we witnessed and what
[SPEAKER_00]: we experienced in the US in 2016,
2017 as different states started to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're starting to see the spread of
cannabis across the European continents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of us that have experienced
that first to market success, we got
[SPEAKER_00]: another market that we can go jump in and
be first to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why these American
companies are looking for other
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities where they can jump in and
take a stranglehold on a market and be
[SPEAKER_00]: first to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think is happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, other opportunities.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are the current US MSOs expansion
consolidation strategies and reasoning
[SPEAKER_05]: behind that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've had several MSOs approach me to
put my fingertips out into the world and
[SPEAKER_00]: see where there's opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're doing is trying to smell
who are the operators that are tied into
[SPEAKER_00]: money, who are tied into legislation,
and who are tied, who really kind of are
[SPEAKER_00]: operating in the background and they know
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the MSOs who've been there done
that are smart and they're looking for the
[SPEAKER_00]: operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, if you're an
operator out there and you're running an
[SPEAKER_00]: operation that is well-funded,
that's connected legislatively,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that has the ability to do big
business across multiple countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should come find me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's ask a question to David,
actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a, you know, continuing from this
topic, can you tell us a few strategies
[SPEAKER_05]: for cannabis investment operators that
we've seen work internationally,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, better or worse, you know,
from the United States into other
[SPEAKER_05]: countries?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Claudia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, let me step back a little
because, first of all, I'm an investment
[SPEAKER_01]: bank, banking firm, Golden Eagle Partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the first investment bank to be in
cannabis in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: We jumped in in 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I want to tell a little story
because it helps inform our perspectives
[SPEAKER_01]: because I've been very lucky to do what
we're doing because I started out in
[SPEAKER_01]: biotech, have two undergrad degrees,
biochem, molecular biology, and got into
[SPEAKER_01]: biotech companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, one based here in Berlin-Buch,
15 years operational experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, got to inventorship on two U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: patents for my work in bioprocessing with
recombinant hemoglobin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, as you guys know, bioprocessing
is a huge part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge part of this industry,
whether you're talking hemp, marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, THC, whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got into investment banking in 2005 doing
biotech deals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also did five years of business
development working with companies doing
[SPEAKER_01]: deals with Pfizer, AstraZeneca,
and then moved back to Colorado in 2009 to
[SPEAKER_01]: lead the life science group at a group
called Headwaters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then left in 2012 to found Golden
Eagle Partners, and that's when Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: and Washington voters legalized it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2013, we started working in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done 25 deals in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We helped Pharmacan raise one of the
leading MSOs, raised 30 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: We helped Panacea, which is a leading hemp
processor, do a strategic deal in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've also spoken around the world on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the only investment bank in Davos in
2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've spoken in Dubai, Toronto twice,
came in Frankfurt earlier this year,
[SPEAKER_01]: and obviously now Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one last thing, too, if you guys know
athletes for care, it's a great group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I played pro lacrosse, so I've been an
ambassador for athletes for care for five
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I'm the chief scientific
advisor for the industry, or for athletes
[SPEAKER_01]: for care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put together a group of the leading
scientists, including Ethan Rousseau,
[SPEAKER_01]: Guillermo Moreno-Sans from Spain,
Raquel Perube from Uruguay, and also Deb
[SPEAKER_01]: Kimlas from the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're talking about science,
cannabis, and finance, we certainly are a
[SPEAKER_01]: global leader.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as getting back to,
hey, Nick, as far as these strategies for
[SPEAKER_01]: even investment and operation in the title
here, one thing I want to say quickly is
[SPEAKER_01]: failure coming from the science side is a
great teacher, especially if you learn
[SPEAKER_01]: from failures, not so bad, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, we've seen a number of
things, failures, and I mentioned this in
[SPEAKER_01]: Davos, certainly a couple of the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have assumed markets are going to
open up much quicker than they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen that as a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may know Canopy Growth put $40 million
into a facility in South Africa and
[SPEAKER_01]: selling it for pennies on the dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that we know a lot about
is that biological supply chains are
[SPEAKER_01]: inherently unstable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of these growers,
you name it, I mean, Aurora had the big
[SPEAKER_01]: facility out of Edmonton that they shut
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you, if you want to talk to
me later, I actually know the reason why.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they assumed, all these producers
assumed, okay, we grow, they'll come,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is another fallacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing that we found,
and I think Jamie will agree, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually been very little history of first
mover advantage in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Serna, where I worked, I was chief
business officer at Serna, I failed to
[SPEAKER_01]: mention, one of the first public companies
in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went public in March 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the biggest name in cannabis in
2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the biggest booth at the NTIA
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're nowhere to be found now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got Dixie, they're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canopy Growth, who knows what's going to
happen with that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those, I think, failure, you can talk
to me later, is a great teacher on what
[SPEAKER_01]: you do with operations or what you do on
investment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you elaborate a little bit more on the
first mover advantage?
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, first of all, I want to
introduce, yes, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to introduce Nicolas Faes,
senior research analyst at Bryan and
[SPEAKER_05]: Gernier.
[SPEAKER_05]: So another research analyst, consulting
advisory guy here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, how are you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, he was stuck, and he went to the
other hotel, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and on top of that, you couldn't
enter the hotel here because there was an
[SPEAKER_03]: important person who was trying to get out
of the hotel, so the police blocked
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a delegation here at this hotel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, sorry to be late.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, not just David, quickly, really
quickly, the first mover advantage,
[SPEAKER_05]: because we're seeing Mexico coming online,
Brazil very soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, all these countries in Europe,
and now Thailand as well, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So why do you think first mover advantage
is not a good thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, people, Jamie will love
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is there's been too much
arrogance and too little humility in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think that their first mover,
they've got $4 billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's gone from Canopy Growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, I think, the very short and
sweet of it is if you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: successful in this industry, take a little
humility and don't be so arrogant.
[SPEAKER_00]: To that point, I think what happens a lot
is people that have had success in
[SPEAKER_00]: mainstream business have a level of
arrogance, and they come in, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, well, there's a bunch of
stoners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to come in, and we're going to
show them how to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they don't realize it's not that
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a very difficult business,
and it's its own industry, it's its own
[SPEAKER_00]: community, and there's a lot to know about
operations operating both in and out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the legal sphere or in the gray area,
and a lot of traditional business people
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't comfortable operating in the gray
area, and you better get used to it if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, so cannabis actually is comprised
of so many verticals, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking at agriculture,
of course, biotech, manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_05]: now technology, distribution, and consumer
products and pharma, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So bank is a consumer product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, Canopy took that approach,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you give us a comparison between the
normal consumer product, the CPG industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: versus the one in cannabis and the
problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most obvious one in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is if I were, let's say, producing,
I don't know why tampons come to mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I were producing that, I'm going to
produce it in one spot, and then I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to put it on a truck and I'm going to ship
it to all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in cannabis, I have to have 50
different manufacturing facilities because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's federally illegal, which means that I
can't do interstate commerce, I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: cross state lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that means as a manufacturer of
chocolate, I have to have 50 different
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate machines, and when they're,
let's say, $150,000 to $250,000 a piece,
[SPEAKER_00]: it becomes cost prohibitive to automate
the manufacturing of the product times 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I'm making decisions about how
many redundant machines do I want to have?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some places where I can't make
the decision to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to have a tempering machine in
every single facility where I'm at,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't necessarily have to have the
big fancy flow wrapper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do that manually or with a foot
pedal because I don't want to have 49
[SPEAKER_00]: redundant flow wrappers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always parallel processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing is basically in
cannabis, we struggle with banking and we
[SPEAKER_00]: struggle with marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, every single person I would
argue on the globe is buying their
[SPEAKER_00]: products on their phone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In that device they have in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis companies are not allowed to
market on social media, on Facebook,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we kind of have to swim upstream in
the marketing world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do what I call guerrilla marketing,
so you have to do targeted marketing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to use influencers, and you kind
of have to figure out ways around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're an agile business operator,
and I would argue that's the other reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why we need to pull people from the roots
and the suits, we need to pull the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: into the industry, is that these are
people that already have experience
[SPEAKER_00]: operating in an upstream environment and
having to go around being out in the open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the people that are going to
give us advice about how do you get your,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you get the word out?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did Jungle Boys, for example,
when they opened in Florida, Jungle Boys
[SPEAKER_00]: outsold every MSO on day one with no
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me how they did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to go talk to them because they
can tell us how they did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we have the arrogance to think,
oh, I come from CPG and I know what to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how many times I've had
an executive come from mainstream go,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, all you got to do is, I'm like,
well, if you want to spend your money
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that, but I'm going to tell you
right now, it's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what invariably happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why Canopy is losing,
you know, $100 million or $300 million a
[SPEAKER_00]: year is because they're just throwing
money at problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to be strategic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't think Constellation gave a
good direction to the company?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Constellation came in and thought,
they were going to treat cannabis like
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol, and it just doesn't work like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you touched on marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marketing is a big problem in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's global.
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook isn't going to let you market
cannabis in Europe either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a global problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's ask a question to Nick.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a deep knowledge in the market,
your research analyst.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what advantages does the European
market have over the US market for
[SPEAKER_05]: investment operations?
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we seen European companies attracting
blue chip companies like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: North American companies have?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, can you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about the, you know,
the advantages and disadvantages of
[SPEAKER_05]: European and US companies, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: With your expertise in different markets,
can you tell us the advantages or
[SPEAKER_05]: disadvantages of the European market over
the US market for investments and
[SPEAKER_05]: operations?
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen European cannabis companies
attract blue chip investments,
[SPEAKER_05]: strategic investments, as much as North
American companies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, even the North American market,
initially there were larger CPG companies
[SPEAKER_03]: who were starting looking and putting
their toes in the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some tobacco companies,
we had some beverage companies,
[SPEAKER_03]: including Constellation brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that they have been drawing,
have been coming back from that idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imperial brands, for example, who took a
stake in Oxley and in the UK Oxford
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Initially, they were very much looking at
cannabis as something that could be a new
[SPEAKER_03]: product and relieve some of their growth
problems, but only to realize that they
[SPEAKER_03]: were actually defocusing from their core
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they say, well, okay, let's stop that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think also Constellation brands have
been looking at like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with AB InBev, who had a joint
venture with Tilray, but then said,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, no, we think that the risk is too
high for us to be involved at this stage
[SPEAKER_03]: in the cannabis area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that the most large CPG
companies who initially were looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: that sector, they have come back from that
idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is, unfortunately, it will be just
on our own and we don't need to look at
[SPEAKER_03]: those bigger companies to support the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so would you agree that the biggest
multinational cannabis companies can be
[SPEAKER_05]: divided kind of in two sections,
consumer product and pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what kind of trends have you seen in
Europe versus in North America?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think also on the pharmaceutical level
is exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take, for example, a Belgian company,
UCB is very strong in epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't dare to touch at all anything that
has to do with cannabis just because they
[SPEAKER_03]: were afraid that it could come back with
them and hurt them because they all had,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course, the recent opioid crisis in
mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are a bit afraid and say,
well, if only that something similar will
[SPEAKER_03]: happen to cannabis, let's stay away,
see how things develop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think also for the medicinal cannabis
market, it's a little bit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happened with the Canadian
companies who initially were medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis companies, then came adult use
and then they did not know what to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just do everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we're doing a bit of medicinal and
we're doing a little bit of adult use and
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, let's go in Europe, let's go in Europe
as well and have, do a bit of that as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just spent money without having
their basis operations in order.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the problem with the
Canadian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the US MSOs are slightly better in
doing so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call that the something shiny syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of it is, oh, there's something
shiny over here and over here and over
[SPEAKER_00]: here because there's so much opportunity
that there is a bottomless pit of where
[SPEAKER_00]: you could spend money to try to make
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to stick to your core focus and
get really good at what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say, it makes me angry that the
stigma is stopping these big companies
[SPEAKER_00]: from diving in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if there was one company that
had a CEO with big enough balls to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna go make a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody's afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this fear, it's time for it to
be over because we know that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: helping people with epilepsy in
Parkinson's and we're only gonna know what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to do with research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need medical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the governments to knock it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, if I could wring all of their
necks personally, I probably would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a CEO with big enough ovaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, ask me to do something and I'll
probably do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is completely out of what we had
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you recommend the government or FDA
to be way more involved and basically
[SPEAKER_05]: regulate better but also substantiate
what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard part is anything that you say is
gonna be controversial because if we ask
[SPEAKER_00]: the government to de-schedule cannabis
from schedule one, then it's gonna open a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole nother can of worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we really need is access to
medical research so that I look at it like
[SPEAKER_00]: we just don't even know how many
cannabinoids exist right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what the combination of this
one, that one, and this terpene could do
[SPEAKER_00]: for this or that ailment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have is a ton of anecdotal
evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that nobody's ever overdosed
on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that it's a plant-based
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it's generally non-addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things I'm making these
statements and I don't even know if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking the truth because I'm going off
anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it would really be great is if we
could figure out that when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy of this sort, that you take this
combination, like my daughter has
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's probably gonna kill me if she hears
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have her on cannabinoid therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give her THC, full spectrum CBD,
which includes a small amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA, linalool, limonene, and turmeric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, is there a pill that she can take
that has all of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happen to be a cannabis executive,
so I can go get linalool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go get limonene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get full spectrum CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have my daughter off of anti-seizure
medications, which were making her sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: for 18 hours a day at 21 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be available to everyone who
has epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just the daughter of a cannabis
executive because she's not had a seizure
[SPEAKER_00]: in two years on that medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's groundbreaking because we know that
these anti-seizure medications have so
[SPEAKER_00]: many side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one ailment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But think about Parkinson's and think
about all the other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just think about the people that want to
use cannabis instead of alcohol,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opiates, which is a poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's super addictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our governments are going to have to step
up and give the people what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Globally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you think that more clinical studies
would benefit not only the pharma vertical
[SPEAKER_05]: of the industry, but also the consumer
product vertical of the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the more we know, the better we
do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nick, give us a little bit of information
on the European and German market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I heard that the German market could be
potentially as big as the California
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you shed some light on this?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at all the markets across the
globe,
[SPEAKER_03]: when we look at how large are those
markets, and there's a complicated
[SPEAKER_03]: calculation on how often does somebody
consume cannabis and at what rate do they
[SPEAKER_03]: consume.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on average, it's around 160 grams per
annum for the cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is true in Canada, that's true in
California, that is true in Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's around that 160 grams on average.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would expect that that's exactly the
same in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we then look at what the prevalence
rate is in Germany, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's just over 7%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 80 million at 7%, that's 5.4,
I believe, 160 grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that is close to 1,000 tons,
so 950 tons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is at the current stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in all the markets, whenever there is
a trend to legalize cannabis, we've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: an uptick in those prevalence rates,
because there are consumers who would love
[SPEAKER_03]: to try it, would love to be on cannabis,
but don't dare to go to the black market
[SPEAKER_03]: or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's quite a significant uptick.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about 50% uptick that we see.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, Canada, 2015 or so,
prevalence rate was 15%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's 21%.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same was true in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although we had that whole heritage in
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So same will happen in Europe and in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, if you go back to my 7%,
well, let's say it takes up to 10%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, 10, that's 8 million times 160,
that is 1,300 tons, way more than the 400
[SPEAKER_03]: tons that somebody came up a couple of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that was a very strong
underestimation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you need to couple with that
the fact that Germany is the size of
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, geographically, and has public
transport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about the whole US
market, or you just think about California
[SPEAKER_00]: geographically, getting product to all of
the people of California is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be much easier to do it in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the distribution in Germany is
much more sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do have that 10% and you have
that small geographic location,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to see the
penetration increase at a much higher
[SPEAKER_00]: rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about other countries in Europe at
the moment?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you give us some information on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think everybody's looking at what
Germany is going to do, how they're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to get around legalizing adult use
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all this will very quickly
follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Portugal, Italy probably as well,
Luxembourg, Malta, who has tried before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Switzerland is already legalizing adult
use, whatever way you look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So give us a little bit of some numbers,
like the projected market size in Europe
[SPEAKER_05]: or in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the same reason that we did earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: For Germany, we can use for Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some countries like France or Italy or
Spain, the prevalence rates are higher
[SPEAKER_03]: already today than that 7% in Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then if we look at it all in all,
we come at a market which is probably be
[SPEAKER_03]: 6,000, 7,000 tons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then pick your price at which current
black market price is 10 euros,
[SPEAKER_03]: probably will go down because the 10 euros
black market that is not competitive
[SPEAKER_03]: price, it's a monopoly run by the cartel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll come down say to 7 euros,
just to say something.
[SPEAKER_03]: 7,000 tons times 7, that's 49,
that's 50 billion markets in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Markets, markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, seriously, as I mentioned before,
they've always been overhyped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the problem with this industry is
it's going to be a race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a commodity and it's
going to be about your supply chain,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're talking about Europe,
where is it going to be produced and how
[SPEAKER_01]: is it going to be produced?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be Columbia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be Lesotho?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be Canary Islands?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be Greece, Guernsey,
Jersey, Cyprus?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked to groups all in those
countries, Macedonia, maybe Portugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the freaking answer and
nobody in this room does.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other question is how is it going to
be produced?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be produced just as a
phytosource?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be, for example,
there's companies now in the US that are
[SPEAKER_01]: producing hemp, growing it outside,
producing CBD and doing a simple chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: conversion to delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then do you have yeast?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a coli?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have chemistry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you have a combination thereof where
you grow, as I mentioned, some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: certain cannabinoid or purify it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have the answer either,
although I'm pretty smart scientifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the markets have always been
overhyped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, what is the supply chain
in five years going to look like and where
[SPEAKER_01]: is it going to be produced?
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whatever market that we look at,
there's always an oversupply.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will be a feature of this
industry for the decades to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the growing, there will be
oversupply way more than demand can
[SPEAKER_03]: stomach.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm growing at whatever it comes from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Initially, Germany probably will be the
garbage bin of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably everybody who has some excess
capacity will start, if they are allowed
[SPEAKER_03]: to, exporting to Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of it is because of the energy
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I'm hoping is that Germany
will allow growers to grow in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't predict that that will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the energy consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is, I think you're right,
the garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't call it the garbage,
but whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the cannabis will come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that David makes a great
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can grow outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's weird that we thought that
people were going to grow cannabis indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada and mimic the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: How expensive is that for you to have a
giant warehouse, have a bunch of lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then grow it inside?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think about from a chocolate
standpoint, nobody grows sugar cane in a
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse and mimics the sun so that they
can make a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, it is a commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think, and the market smart thing
I agree with, but I also think you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have market predictors to know what the
demand is going to be so that you can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of wrap your brain around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've seen is this cycle of
governments always come in with fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't issue enough licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the people sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I predict this will happen in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day one of sales, doesn't matter what
it is, everyone's going to sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to go, oh crap,
we need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're going to open up the
floodgates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then too much cannabis is going to
come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have an oversupply.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happens every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the market speaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's the good operators who are
running good companies that will make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody else gets flushed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these companies that you talked about
in the very beginning in 2014 that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: exist, this is the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason they don't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the end, it will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where cannabis is very similar
to other CPG companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It are the proper operators who have a
strategy, who know their consumers,
[SPEAKER_03]: who produce at low cost and try to
differentiate their product and brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: That are going to be the winners.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that sense, it's very similar to
other CPG companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, the commodity that
we are all going to end up fighting for is
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about that one, by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's important, the consumer product
space.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is the difference between shelf
space seen as a commodity in regular
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer product companies versus
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, think about when you go into a
grocery store, you have these end caps,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have merchant, you have entire
companies whose job it is to merchandise
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they come in and they teach the CPG
companies how to put products at eye
[SPEAKER_00]: level, how to bribe the store so that
they're not down here on the shelf,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're not up here on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all want eye level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have colors in your branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all know all the fast food companies
in America, they're all red and yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wendy's, McDonald's, they're all red and
yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that is the psychological color of
hunger, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes very sophisticated,
very scientifically oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's big business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all big business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis right now is everybody who's got
a little bit of a creative bone,
[SPEAKER_00]: they create some cool brand and that's all
gonna wash out and we're gonna see it
[SPEAKER_00]: become systemized and scientifically
designed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if Marcus has any insight
into that coming forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: From your area.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I would add that in Europe,
the companies have less money and I think
[SPEAKER_04]: the problem you mentioned and coming back
to the, I think truly is a good company,
[SPEAKER_04]: is a good example, but there are also
negative examples in the industry and I
[SPEAKER_04]: think Europe has the advantage that there
is not enough money available for the
[SPEAKER_04]: sector at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the company really have to spend the
money smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think that's an advantage,
but also disadvantage because it goes
[SPEAKER_04]: slower as expected.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the problem is really the
legal frame because I would compare Europe
[SPEAKER_04]: with US because you have 28 countries with
different laws and in US it's similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have different states.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some states is allowed, some not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's the problem that we
need a European wide legal framework legal
[SPEAKER_04]: frame that companies can operate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have, we have only a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anybody here who would like to
ask a question to the panel?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just raise your hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for Claudia and the whole panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Philippe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come from in the UK.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make, he nailed cannabinoid therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We come from the pharma sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question about investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big elephant in the room, particularly
when it comes to clinical evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, Jamie, particularly said we need
clinical evidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the moment, I don't think the
margin on the products, particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers justify the investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can someone comment on that elephant in
the room?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we going to raise the money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is going to pay for it and how the
product is going to pay for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let the investment advisor answer
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will come from biotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a company called radical
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know out of LA started by Jeff
Chen, who's essentially doing this with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids where you can do like what's
called a stage four trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially it's kind of out in the market
where you're doing really good data
[SPEAKER_01]: analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the things you guys,
I looked them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing some really interesting
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a cheaper way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually are working right now with
EPM, which is one of the leading Israeli
[SPEAKER_01]: companies generating cannabinoid acids and
they're going to do a clinical trial
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to raise a lot of money,
but you bring up a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be creative and find a way to
finance really good science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a clinical trial because most
people we know and we've been raising
[SPEAKER_01]: money for science-based cannabis companies
since 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy because you're straddling
the biotech cannabis sector and the
[SPEAKER_01]: biotech investors don't want to do
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like to do weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look at the cannabis sectors
and they're like that science makes my
[SPEAKER_01]: head spin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, I don't have an answer,
especially in 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think necessity is the mother of
invention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that we need it, somebody is
going to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people are figuring it out like
Jeff Chen, but I think the other thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I find in cannabis is that there's a
lot of personal stories that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly high net worth individuals or
family offices where they have a personal
[SPEAKER_00]: story or personal connection to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have some people that are
single-handedly funding things because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're passionate about what's happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody else who would like to ask a
question?
[SPEAKER_05]: We have less than one minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I think you've taught them
everything they need to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it again for Claudia and Marcus
and Jamie and everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo.
