[SPEAKER_05]: Join us for the next International
Cannabis Business Conference in San
[SPEAKER_05]: Francisco, California at the Hyatt Regency
February 15th and 16th.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the conference we're having here at
the Oregon Convention Center.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the International Cannabis Business
Conference and Alex Rogers is putting this
[SPEAKER_03]: on and just been remarkable.
[SPEAKER_03]: A great set, a diverse set of vendors and
a fabulous set of speakers.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been a great crowd, great vendors,
great attendees.
[SPEAKER_04]: The feedback has been extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had so many people tell me that this
is the best conference they've ever been
[SPEAKER_04]: to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here to learn how to tell the future
and I think I'm getting a lot of great
[SPEAKER_06]: information.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people here are great and it's not
much stress.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have free coffee and someone's
walking around with sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_10]: The beauty of ICBC is meeting all the
activists, lawyers, gardeners and people
[SPEAKER_10]: on the forefront of providing medicine and
good product to people and patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very knowledgeable people, people from all
over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a great experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard some amazing things already.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a congressman here who is speaking
about where the industry is headed,
[SPEAKER_06]: where the laws are headed federally,
which is very important if you're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: be investing in the cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Ed Rosenthal and it was a
pleasure for me to come to this
[SPEAKER_01]: conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It addressed the needs of the local people
of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing, the speeches have been
incredible.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've met a lot of people that have been
great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just making contacts with different
dispensaries and grow houses and kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: forming partnerships.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here at this conference to talk to
testing laboratories and producers and
[SPEAKER_07]: processors about laboratory accreditation
and what it can do for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we're about is about promoting
organics in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: The magazine stands for something,
defending our patients everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: The magazine allows us to actually put
input and relevant articles out into the
[SPEAKER_08]: public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our direct target market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really anybody who's trying to get into
the cannabis industry, trying to start a
[SPEAKER_02]: business, trying to make sure that they're
doing things right, doing things
[SPEAKER_02]: legitimately, that's what we're here to
do, just to help the industry and make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure everything's done in the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give Alex, Mr. Rogers, full credit because
this is a really good event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got many good contacts and I hope we
will meet again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a stack of business cards here,
meeting a whole lot of new folks that are
[SPEAKER_03]: just getting into the business,
but also a few of the business people and
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of the activists that I've been
working with here in Oregon for the past
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a combination of family reunion
and kind of a speed dating session.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is just some of the things at the
International Cannabis Business
[SPEAKER_05]: Conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to keep this thing rolling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Join us for the next International
Cannabis Business Conference in San
[SPEAKER_05]: Francisco, California at the Hyatt
Regency, February 15th and 16th.
Thank you.
