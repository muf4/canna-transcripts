[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start our next panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're going to discuss
cannabinoid science.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a giant panel up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to lead us in that, we have a
biochemist, a researcher from the National
[SPEAKER_07]: Institute of Biology in Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's welcome Professor Dr. Tamara
Lakhternshek.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me start with the words of Rafael
Mechulam.
[SPEAKER_04]: who was already mentioned in the previous
lecture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said that the plant that had been
used for thousands of years all around the
[SPEAKER_04]: world, actually, from this plant,
we discover a new pharmaceutical,
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmacological system that is really of
immense importance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, unfortunately, he passed away,
as we heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of scientists, research
institutes, universities, and industry is
[SPEAKER_04]: following his research because he is
considered as a godfather of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: science and medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So also, this session will be dedicated to
actually medical research, actually
[SPEAKER_04]: research science-based medicine,
which will not only be on research,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also how to facilitate the research
into clinical application and how to
[SPEAKER_04]: actually transfer this knowledge to
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here in Slovenia, we have a lot of good
scientists, especially in natural
[SPEAKER_04]: sciences, especially in biomedicine and
clinical medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But very few, unfortunately, for several
reasons that we are going to discuss today
[SPEAKER_04]: as well, are following the cannabis
research or are focusing on cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: research.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why it's very, very slowly
paving the way to the medical application.
[SPEAKER_04]: So today, it's my great pleasure to
introduce three panelists.
[SPEAKER_04]: First is our guest from Israel,
Dr. Ilya Reznik.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second is Dr. Professor David
Neubauer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last, but not, of course, least
important is Borat Stuka, the pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Dr. Ilya Reznik, the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a presentation, please?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ilya Reznik is a very well-known,
not only scientist, but a medical
[SPEAKER_04]: practitioner in Israel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can learn from him what is the
practice in Israel compared to Slovenia
[SPEAKER_04]: and where is Slovenia in terms of
international picture of medical use.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my great pleasure to be with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love Slovenian people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had been here for several times for
different occasions, usually with a series
[SPEAKER_06]: of seminars organized by patients and
activist organizations of demystification
[SPEAKER_06]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very successful and many people in
the hall participated in these seminars.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is my great honor to be with you
this time and my appreciation to your
[SPEAKER_06]: parliament member and the health secretary
of Slovenia to be at this convention.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great moment where we are now,
so we should decide if we are going with
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis as medicine or we should continue
to consider it to be a drug, maybe a
[SPEAKER_06]: narcotic drug, maybe dangerous narcotic
drug like it was established for the last
[SPEAKER_06]: 80 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So may I have the next slide?
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a matter of fact.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot of people that are using
cannabis for different medical purposes,
[SPEAKER_06]: but what kind of research we had been made
till 2009, almost zero.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for the last 15 years, we have some
good clinical research for some illnesses
[SPEAKER_06]: and we don't know we do not have any
conclusive results.
[SPEAKER_06]: European Mediterranean Agency declared
that they could consider cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine probably after receiving the
significant number of conclusive research,
[SPEAKER_06]: but they never defined what they are
considered to be a conclusive research.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the matter of fact that the research in
this area is underfunded, but we have some
[SPEAKER_06]: good clinical trials, usually had been
funded by the companies such as Jazz
[SPEAKER_06]: Pharmaceuticals, previously GW
Pharmaceuticals, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are performing a lot of clinical
research, for example in Israel,
[SPEAKER_06]: like you asked me, and for different
disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_06]: disease, epilepsy, Dravet syndrome,
post-traumatic stress disorder.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have conclusive results?
[SPEAKER_06]: Till now maybe not, but we could,
who could decide and who should decide
[SPEAKER_06]: what is being considered to be a
conclusive results or conclusive research.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another fact is that we now in the
transition in Israel, we in transition
[SPEAKER_06]: space perform going from the plant to
medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our Ministry of Health declared reform
saying now we will have cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it real?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it for real?
[SPEAKER_06]: How we can perform overwhelming
medicalization for cannabis and
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids, because this is a plant,
and plant does not hear the orders of our
[SPEAKER_06]: Ministry of Health or Director General.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is some facts, and may I have
another slide?
[SPEAKER_06]: So pharmaceutical industry providing some
good examples how they're taking cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: to different directions, so they could use
all cannabinoid derived components,
[SPEAKER_06]: or they can use different side of
components, and making some medicine like
[SPEAKER_06]: Sativex or Epidiolex, this driven
cannabinoids from the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is one of the answers that had
been provided by the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we know that cannabis and cannabinoid
compounds could be used for different
[SPEAKER_06]: disorders.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just need to understand the nature of
the plant and how to adapt and adjust
[SPEAKER_06]: different cannabinoids to the different
patients and to his different diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some patients has several diseases in
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Could we treat them with the same plant or
with same cannabinoids based medicine?
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not have clear answer till now,
but we are trying to provide it in the
[SPEAKER_06]: short future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is an Israeli system saying,
we are going to the overwhelming
[SPEAKER_06]: medicalization of cannabis based on two
systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they are looking only for THC-CBD
ratio, and also they are looking for
[SPEAKER_06]: Indica or Sativea predominance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it enough to decide that now we do not
have a plant, we have a medicine?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure, and we suggest that maybe
now we have another system like we called
[SPEAKER_06]: coaptation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So putting together cannabinoids and
plants, together we could make a cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: plant as a medicine, but medicine without
destroying the nature of this plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our idea and I hope we have
another views in the panel and maybe from
[SPEAKER_06]: the questions from the auditory.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
I
[SPEAKER_04]: will just ask you a short question
responding to your comment that you were
[SPEAKER_04]: actually financed by the pharma industry
more than by the public health system or
[SPEAKER_04]: public research funds.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think is the future?
[SPEAKER_04]: Will we need more public research or all
research and application will be financed
[SPEAKER_04]: by the big pharma or the cannabis pharma?
[SPEAKER_06]: As I aware that National Institute of
Health in US funds only studies that
[SPEAKER_06]: target to negative effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Only such studies could obtain the grants
from National Institute of Health,
[SPEAKER_06]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an example how public health
system relates to cannabis and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_06]: research.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my hope that private sector and
companies and different consortiums could
[SPEAKER_06]: rise a good quality studies that may
probably will serve as a conclusive
[SPEAKER_06]: elements to European Medicinal Agency for
FDA, etc.
[SPEAKER_04]: So using the combination or the
cooperation between the public and private
[SPEAKER_04]: sector will be?
[SPEAKER_06]: Public sector, I do not have hope for
public sector.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Israel we have all studies that we had
been made in Israel.
[SPEAKER_06]: They mostly of them funded by the private
sector.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much on that issue and I
will then try to explain how is now in
[SPEAKER_04]: Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you should start later.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Borat is a pharmacist as I said.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a leader of pharmaceutical biology at
Faculty of Pharmacy of University of
[SPEAKER_04]: Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Borat, please present your work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, I would like to thank the
organizers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really glad that I'm here because
Slovenia is one of the leading member
[SPEAKER_09]: states in terms of science and cannabis,
but unfortunately the regulation is still
[SPEAKER_09]: behind.
[SPEAKER_09]: So allow me to introduce myself very
briefly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm professor at the Faculty of Pharmacy
University of Ljubljana linked with
[SPEAKER_09]: pharmaceutical biotechnology and plant
science.
[SPEAKER_09]: Besides, I am a senior health expert in
Vienna dealing with the technology
[SPEAKER_09]: transfer to developing countries and very
recently I became a consultant for Herbal
[SPEAKER_09]: Pharmacopeia at the WHO which is again
part of broad area of research and you
[SPEAKER_09]: know plants and cannabis and so on.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm really looking forward for these
two positions and opportunities.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, let me go.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will do it by myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes, first steps regarding our group at
the Faculty of Pharmacy dealing with
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know from my humble experience and
opinion is that education is the most
[SPEAKER_09]: important point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Education at the first, not only for the
health professionals, but predominantly
[SPEAKER_09]: for NAV individuals and patients as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: As soon as we'll be able to convince the
whole positive effects of cannabis or
[SPEAKER_09]: compounds from cannabis or combination of
their, I mean all these compounds to the
[SPEAKER_09]: public, this will be the ultimate goal in
order to make the final regulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So okay, there are many this kind,
actually not only congresses, but I travel
[SPEAKER_09]: through all Slovenia and Croatia.
[SPEAKER_09]: I delivered a lot of talks among NAV and
public and some patients as well and okay,
[SPEAKER_09]: this was because I'm not active anymore in
this field in terms of education.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a task of my colleagues at the
Faculty of Pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Regarding the cannabis research at the
Faculty of Pharmacy, we are focused,
[SPEAKER_09]: that means our group, we are focused on
the analytical point of view.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because simply we need to standardize
material in this or that manner or we are
[SPEAKER_09]: talking about the flowers or we are
talking about, okay, something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope not from my point of view,
but never mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean analytical point, it is the
focus of our group.
[SPEAKER_09]: Beside, now we would like to simply to go
further with the research that I gonna
[SPEAKER_09]: talk about, this will be my latest slide,
but now here, I'd like to focus your
[SPEAKER_09]: attention.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very proud of this international
dissemination.
[SPEAKER_09]: Together with Tamara, we attended at least
two or three conferences and meetings
[SPEAKER_09]: around, I mean apart from Slovenian
territory, but this one, it was something
[SPEAKER_09]: special.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess where is this country that organized
this very important, this Eurasian forum
[SPEAKER_09]: and this was in Kazakhstan, could you
imagine?
[SPEAKER_09]: In Kazakhstan, this was in 2019 and it was
under the patronage of the Riga
[SPEAKER_09]: Nuzarbayev, daughter of former president
of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nuzarbayev.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they were at that time, I mean they
were really focused on this point,
[SPEAKER_09]: whether to make marijuana and cannabis
legal or it's still illegal in the country
[SPEAKER_09]: which is not the most developed country
and in the country which from the
[SPEAKER_09]: economically, historically and even,
I don't know, religious point of view,
[SPEAKER_09]: it is something in between.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this was a very good conference and
here are some statements that I try to
[SPEAKER_09]: focus now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, okay, we are talking about
recreational use and we're talking about
[SPEAKER_09]: medical cannabis, medical use.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine with me, both, but it should be
separate by two different regulatory
[SPEAKER_09]: guidelines or laws or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: It could go in parallel.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is important to know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not necessary to be consecutively
developed and this is our ultimate goal to
[SPEAKER_09]: win with both laws in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_09]: And very last slide.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes, now we try to find out together
with the Italian partners and guys from
[SPEAKER_09]: Belgrade as well, what is the impact of
CBD, THC and the combination of other
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoids on the longevity or
anti-aging if you wish.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anti-aging is something that we would,
all of us, the more old we are,
[SPEAKER_09]: the more focus we on this kind of or this
area of research.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was really extremely positively
shocked, let's say, where this was very
[SPEAKER_09]: fascinating keynote presentation,
hibernation, cannabis and anti-aging.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know that heartbeat of turtles,
that it is perhaps 12 per minutes.
[SPEAKER_09]: The less heartbeats per minutes is present
in the animal, the older, in terms of age,
[SPEAKER_09]: this animal could live.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, this is something that we would
like to, for the research, not only with
[SPEAKER_09]: the CBD, but also with THC and preliminary
findings that there are under-expressed of
[SPEAKER_09]: pro-inflammatory cytokines, gene coding
from pro-inflammatory cytokines and
[SPEAKER_09]: over-expressed genes that are directly or
indirectly related to anti-aging.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by this, I will stop and I'm open for
any kind of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you very much, Borut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, it's also my question because as you
all know or don't know actually,
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis treatment is very beneficial
for all diseases that are associated with
[SPEAKER_04]: aging, such as neurodegenerative diseases,
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease,
[SPEAKER_04]: cardiovascular diseases, chronic
inflammation, also multiple sclerosis and
[SPEAKER_04]: so on, and especially cancer, and all
these increase exponentially during aging.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a very good news that we can
also use cannabinoids both to prevent or
[SPEAKER_04]: to actually slow down aging process at the
same time the associated diseases with
[SPEAKER_04]: aging could be also treated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a big hope for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is a very important
finding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in future, we all know that longevity
is perhaps a problem for some people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But actually, it's not because what we
want is to keep older population active
[SPEAKER_04]: and healthy and thereby contributing to
economies to a great extent, especially
[SPEAKER_04]: this is called also silver economy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why older people, keeping them
in fit, it's very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you think that we can perhaps use
this then in elderly homes or something
[SPEAKER_04]: just to treat the patients or diets or
something?
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very complex question.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, if you are asking our
medical insurance companies, they are not
[SPEAKER_09]: very happy to pay for pensions until when
the individual is 120 years old.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in this case, this is very
economically.
[SPEAKER_09]: But let me be very serious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I really believe on this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, our findings, not only our,
but it looks like that inflammation is one
[SPEAKER_09]: general degeneration over the years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the way, you know that obesity,
the new definition of obesity,
[SPEAKER_09]: it is mild general inflammation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So as soon as we are able to decrease,
not all of them, but at least some more,
[SPEAKER_09]: the most important genes coding for
interlooking alpha, B, then 12,
[SPEAKER_09]: 23, 17, all these cytokines are related
with chronically diseases that are present
[SPEAKER_09]: predominantly in the older generation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, yes, I believe, but you know,
we are all, the bottleneck is regulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And on the other hand, we do not have a
very clear indications, the list of
[SPEAKER_09]: indications that might be treated with.
[SPEAKER_09]: But perhaps this is the topic that
we'll... This is the future of research.
[SPEAKER_09]: Noybauer is the right person to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Professor Noybauer, he was for 20 years
the head of the pediatric neurology
[SPEAKER_04]: department.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we switch from older population to
children.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he is treating epilepsy very
successfully for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he will tell you about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus he will present himself as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much Tamara for the
invitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm actually a professor in
pediatrics, but also a senior consultant
[SPEAKER_02]: in child neurology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also visiting professor mainly to the
Middle East countries like Kuwait,
[SPEAKER_02]: Bahrain, Dubai, but also to Kazakhstan and
Croatia and Zambia and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have just three slides, three different
researches.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it in this last, actually nine
years that we are using different
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids for severe childhood
neurological problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one and the largest study we did
is a treating resistant epilepsy in
[SPEAKER_02]: children.
[SPEAKER_02]: Resistant epilepsy, that means that at
least two standard anti-epileptic drugs
[SPEAKER_02]: are not successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the group we have taken are 66
children with severe, severe resistant
[SPEAKER_02]: epilepsy, which we call now developmental
epileptic and cephalopathies.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that the child is having so
many seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe at the beginning the child can be
normal, completely normal, but he's having
[SPEAKER_02]: so many epileptic fits, epileptic
seizures, maybe even 100 per day,
[SPEAKER_02]: that his mental state is going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's more and more mentally retarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even his motor abilities, even if his
structure of the brain is in the
[SPEAKER_02]: neuroimaging completely normal,
is less and less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in these children we used first
cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is 98% natural cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the success rate was extremely good.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not working, but you can see at
the upper part, the seizure free was in
[SPEAKER_02]: one fifth of the children, which is 21%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in more than 50%, the reduction was
for more than 50 amount of the seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also in the others, there was some
improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the study, two children died
because of this severe epileptic and
[SPEAKER_02]: cephalopathies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it was, we started in 2015 and the
publication was in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, now we are treating more than 200
patients with CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them, those included at the
beginning, so the period is now nearly
[SPEAKER_02]: nine years of follow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in some of them, we switched from the
100% cannabidiol to cannabis products,
[SPEAKER_02]: which usually our parents are getting from
the states, this is Haley's Hope and
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlotte Webb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the results are also very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one is a recent trial we did in
severely behaviorally changed autistic
[SPEAKER_02]: children.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not having only the autistic
features, but the main reason that we
[SPEAKER_02]: tried this cannabis product was their
behavioral outbreaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had severe outbreaks, so sometimes
they were aggressive, mostly to
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves, so self aggressive,
but also to their families.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were using the cannabis products,
which is CBD THC ratio of 10 to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The doses are up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never go more than one milligram per kg
per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to the THC dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see, the improvement was
actually perfect in all the 15 children.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a lot of improvement in
their behavior in different domains.
[SPEAKER_02]: The product was supplied by Pharmahand.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, when we just finished the study,
the drug agency of Slovenia prohibited
[SPEAKER_02]: this company to supply us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this way, we did a kind of trial of
one study, which means that each patient,
[SPEAKER_02]: you ask the parents how it was when he was
receiving the product and how is it now
[SPEAKER_02]: when he's not receiving and it was
terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the parents were phoning and emailing
me when the product will be again
[SPEAKER_02]: available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do hope it will be soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last one is the same product we
used.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is CBD to THC 10 to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the doses are the same as for these
autistic children, never going over one
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram per kg per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are for the cerebral palsy
children.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the most severe, oops,
something wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the most severe cerebral palsy
children, those who are bound to
[SPEAKER_02]: wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the results are very, very much
promising.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot give the final results because it
is a part of the PhD study of one of our
[SPEAKER_02]: younger colleagues, but the spasticity is
much, much less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these children are even
sleeping during the night because they
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't sleep because of these spastic
seizures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the parents were also extremely
satisfied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, David, very much for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also for your marvelous work, what you are
doing with children and how to also help
[SPEAKER_04]: them and help their families.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you said that you had problems now
with regulatory, actually with kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: nearly prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may say so in Slovenia, the situation
and the restrictions in regulations are
[SPEAKER_04]: very, very, very, very bad in terms of our
agency, which is our public aid medical
[SPEAKER_04]: agency, as well as our National Institute
of Health, which all are trying to really
[SPEAKER_04]: restrict, even in such studies that are so
successful and so effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the drug agency from Slovenia,
which prohibited this product to be given
[SPEAKER_02]: further for the studies and for the
treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we did clinical study of this
treatment because they had these analytic
[SPEAKER_02]: certificates and I don't know what good
product of growing the cannabis and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the GMP, they didn't have.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is the last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this is the good medical product
certificate, which is very difficult to
[SPEAKER_02]: get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say at this pharma hemp company,
which is a Slovenian company, that they
[SPEAKER_02]: will get it maybe within two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now because we were without the product
for the clinical use, because we wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: do a short study or short trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thereafter, to give these children a
possibility to be treated further.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we asked the company abroad if they can
bring us and if they have GMP product and
[SPEAKER_02]: they said, yes, yes, we do have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still we had for two months or three
months negotiations with the drug agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems that now for a short period of
time, they will approve medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: to be imported to Slovenia and so we can
go further on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we see that we really have a very
difficult situation and this has to
[SPEAKER_04]: change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why also we are having this
meeting here to try to find the ways to
[SPEAKER_04]: facilitate the drug use like it is,
for example, in Israel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how is that in Israel with the
regulation compared to, let's say,
[SPEAKER_04]: Western countries or compared to Slovenia?
[SPEAKER_06]: We use cannabis for medical purposes in
Israel for the last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is allowed and the regulation,
but the regulation is unstable and going
[SPEAKER_06]: to the different directions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I already showed it in my slides that
previously we had a very good system where
[SPEAKER_06]: each patient were connected with some
particular company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he has his cannabis prescription each
month that permitted him to buy cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: with different strains and each patient
had a chance and the right to choose which
[SPEAKER_06]: strain is appropriate to him and to change
strains each month.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was very good system and it was some
particular funding that each patient paid
[SPEAKER_06]: by himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the price was fixed for each amount of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was very difficult to companies
because companies were forced to subsidize
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis for patients who had more than 50
gram of cannabis a month.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now they changed the system and
regulation in Israel saying that each
[SPEAKER_06]: patient, and we now have 130,000 active
patients visa licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the largest in the world number
of the patients treated with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: per capita in the world in Israel now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are still leading in this point,
but each patient now has his prescription
[SPEAKER_06]: for six months or one year and he is going
to the pharmacy and paying much more than
[SPEAKER_06]: he paid before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Approximate price in Israel is about 300
shekels.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is about $70 per 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it much?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it expensive?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, probably yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will pay patients first to pay it,
but we have some several groups of
[SPEAKER_06]: patients who subsidized for this price.
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, Israeli army veterans,
police veterans, terrorist acts,
[SPEAKER_06]: casualties, and also patients people who
suffer from the work accidents,
[SPEAKER_06]: car collisions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have insurance paying for the
cannabis and also for visiting physicians
[SPEAKER_06]: because now cannabis now belongs in Israel
to private sector.
[SPEAKER_06]: So mostly prescriptions were issued by the
private sector.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now regulation is changing and it's going
slowly from private to public health
[SPEAKER_06]: system and public health system is unready
to accept cannabis as a treatment and is
[SPEAKER_06]: not ready to pay for it and is not ready
to provide doctor attention to these
[SPEAKER_06]: patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have unstable regulation,
but the steps being made by our
[SPEAKER_06]: parliament, and I'm a senior advisor for
parliament for cannabis regulation,
[SPEAKER_06]: committee for cannabis regulation,
they're making good steps in the proper
[SPEAKER_06]: direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I agree with them, but the system,
the whole system should be prepared to
[SPEAKER_06]: this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course I agree with my colleagues
that doctors should be educated because
[SPEAKER_06]: majority of Israeli doctors are standing
against any kind of use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just do not see cannabis as a medical
use.
[SPEAKER_06]: They consider it to be part of the
addiction program for such patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they need to change their mindset.
[SPEAKER_06]: It usually takes more than 10 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me and my friends, we changed the general
attitudes of medical community a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit, but it took us 15 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now when the cannabis will go from private
to public sector, we will need another 15
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you see a good ahead and I'm
optimistic and I wish that Slovenia will
[SPEAKER_06]: go to the proper direction, learning from
our mistakes and building their own proper
[SPEAKER_06]: system that will be applicable to this
wonderful country and these people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you for this answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Education was already mentioned by Borut,
and what do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: How should we promote education also to
the medical doctor?
[SPEAKER_04]: Here I see most of the problem because
they are not educated.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not aware and they are not
interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, this is a very good point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we tried in the past several times,
first to start with the MDIS, with the
[SPEAKER_09]: medical professionals and I believe,
yes, particularly younger generation that
[SPEAKER_09]: they are quite open to this.
[SPEAKER_09]: But let me go back.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to recall what Professor
Nobauer said about medical or drug agency.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not player, the advocate of this,
but from the very strict pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_09]: point of view, all kind of components,
isolated or synthetic are APs.
[SPEAKER_09]: AP means active pharmaceutical
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they should fulfill all the criteria
in terms of GMP and so on and so on and so
[SPEAKER_09]: on.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what's the problem is a very slow
reaction, very rigid reaction.
[SPEAKER_09]: And our goal here, it is to boost,
to strengthen the system, how to regulate,
[SPEAKER_09]: how to allow regulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: But first it is education.
[SPEAKER_09]: So education hand by hand with the
regulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe that this is right time now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, we'll be a member state with
the less regulated system.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I think we already are.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you think also about the
student's program, medical or your
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical faculty?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they learn about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Me personally, I deliver two or three
lessons, topics on the cannabinoid and the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoid system, as well as Professor
Tamara Lach established and subject,
[SPEAKER_09]: not only on this particular manner.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm talking about cannabis,
but in general one, yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, younger generation,
it is very open for this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as soon as we gonna have this one or
two laws, I am for two laws.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to separate medical use and
recreational use.
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, they will be a mess.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we will do that with all this kind
of regulations and guidelines,
[SPEAKER_09]: there will be open space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully we will go faster than like
15 years because... I just wonder how you
[SPEAKER_06]: are trying to do it practically.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm a practical physician.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm working with the patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my patients are coming to me and asking
how much cannabis I should use every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say, please try not to exceed one or
two gram a day according to your
[SPEAKER_06]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for some of them, one gram a day,
it's not enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of them would like to have fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first half gram will be for medical
use and another half of gram will be for
[SPEAKER_06]: recreation.
[SPEAKER_06]: How you could distinguish it, please?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is a real problem that is rising
from medical community.
[SPEAKER_06]: They raise such questions because saying
we do not want to play with recreational,
[SPEAKER_06]: why?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people could be addicted.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we should say them that only five to
7% of people ever could be addicted.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they ever get addicted in each society
about five to 7%.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we should not encourage any kind of
addiction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I belong to very...
[SPEAKER_06]: very cautious and responsible doctors.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am looking for mode of use of cannabis
in my patients because I consider them...
[SPEAKER_06]: The safety of my patients is the goal and
I do not want them to be addicted.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we should appreciate also the right
not to... So the boundaries between
[SPEAKER_06]: recreational use and strict medical use
are not clear.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may... is the same situation with,
let's say, all painkillers, there are
[SPEAKER_09]: limits.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you could be addicted of this or this,
some opioids like fentanyl and so on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who is responsible for this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but okay, so... Good point.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what we have to have in our hand,
it is standardized material first.
[SPEAKER_06]: Standardized material patients are no
standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Patients are different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Personalized approach should be...
[SPEAKER_09]: But about abuse, yesterday, I heard that
it was a very good party.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a limit with the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be used for abuse.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in this case, you know, this is,
again, education in titration of patient.
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that you titrate your patient
before to get an impression of the optimal
[SPEAKER_09]: dose and so on, so on, so on.
[SPEAKER_09]: There we have devices that could do
instead of us.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yes, it's an issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a personal approach and how we would
personalize the treatment of the patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that... The most important thing that
who are the patients because... Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: of course, but how do you study that?
[SPEAKER_06]: In Israel, we have patients that are very,
very experienced users and they began that
[SPEAKER_06]: this topic to be said aloud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Patients who used cannabis and they even
provide us some education because nobody
[SPEAKER_06]: educated us from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'm an educator, but I educated
myself and I previously was educated by
[SPEAKER_06]: the patients, by the patients who use
cannabis for their medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to appreciate this chain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who educate the educators and who provide
us knowledge?
[SPEAKER_06]: I also was educated by master class in
cannabis by the Bedrokan in Holland,
[SPEAKER_06]: but first, my patients educated me what is
bad and what is good for them and my
[SPEAKER_06]: responsible approach is saying that I
should learn this nature of each patient.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, possessing is a personalized
approach, but patients are so different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them absolutely cannabis naive and
we should take very careful and very
[SPEAKER_06]: cautious approach to them and some
patients are very, very experienced with
[SPEAKER_06]: different strains of cannabis and they can
tell you whatever happened with them when
[SPEAKER_06]: they are taking this one or other one.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should different approach to each
patient and appreciate the right to use
[SPEAKER_06]: medical cannabis for their illnesses
without preventing them, but making it in
[SPEAKER_06]: a very responsible way.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should stop here and give also
the opportunity for some question from the
[SPEAKER_04]: audience to this interesting topic,
especially on the how should we improve
[SPEAKER_04]: the treatment?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are these pilot studies or are these
actually clinical trials like classical
[SPEAKER_04]: clinical trials or are these other trials?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to maybe ask Dr. Czerwek,
is she here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you please talk about that because you
have a lot of experience in oncology.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a microphone for you right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it again for the panel right
quick while we get it together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting stuff.
Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you will answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, I'm Matej Czerwek.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been working with Dr. Czerwek,
which is also my grandmother for 10 years
[SPEAKER_03]: in cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am also a doctor, but not a practicing
clinician and I would have a question for
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Reznik.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Israel, when you have the treatment of
patients here, I know there's probably a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of need to get further evidence about
the effectiveness because I would guess
[SPEAKER_03]: there's also some pushback from some parts
of the medical society in regards to the
[SPEAKER_03]: actual effectiveness of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to ask, are the
questionnaires like the crucial part of
[SPEAKER_03]: following the effectiveness or how do you
monitor the effects and collect the data
[SPEAKER_03]: or the effectiveness of the cannabis in
Israel?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Israel, each doctor who has his
practice with a medical cannabis use his
[SPEAKER_06]: own system.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not standardized and it's not
randomized.
[SPEAKER_06]: My approach is quasi-scientific approach.
[SPEAKER_06]: I use questions like quality of life
questions, anxiety questions,
[SPEAKER_06]: questionnaires, but you see, it is very
difficult to apply in the private
[SPEAKER_06]: practice.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do not have government adopted medical
cannabis clinics.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why in my previous career,
I was a scientific psychiatrist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a chief of research in our mental
health center, so I use a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: questionnaires because I am very familiar
with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not a practice at all, but I'm also
working for some British chain of the
[SPEAKER_06]: medical cannabis clinics and there,
from the very beginning, we decided we use
[SPEAKER_06]: questionnaires in order to follow up and
outcomes and the results, intermediate
[SPEAKER_06]: results from baseline to outcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a very good point to assess the
quality of treatment, the quality of the
[SPEAKER_06]: intervention using the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Later, we could have it as a publication,
so we need to derive good knowledge from
[SPEAKER_06]: everyday practice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are no questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to actually at last... Do you
have a question here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: His hand raise was so small.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question for all the speakers.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your advice on how to connect the
Slovenia's private sector with the public
[SPEAKER_05]: health?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to open the topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can answer that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working in the public health system,
so usually we say that prescribing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis products is in the hands of the
tertiary care institutes, that means
[SPEAKER_02]: university medical centers in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two, one in Ljubljana and one in
Maribor and we do believe that it is
[SPEAKER_02]: better to stay within the public health
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to answer Matej, I'm a pediatrician,
that's why we use questionnaires for
[SPEAKER_02]: parents because the children are too much
handicapped that they can fulfill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use two.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is the PASS, which means parental
satisfaction score, which is very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good scoring system and very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one is CGI, which is clinical
global impression.
[SPEAKER_02]: CGII, which means clinical global
impression improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the beginning, we give CGI-S,
which means clinical global improvement
[SPEAKER_02]: severity scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just compare the beginning of the
treatment with the severity scale and at
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of the treatment, let it be six
weeks or two months or three months,
[SPEAKER_02]: the improvement scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will get very, very nice scaling.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I showed like improvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you have others which are much
more complicated, but maybe this is for
[SPEAKER_02]: these practical guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is enough to give you the impression
whether it is better or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to conclude.
[SPEAKER_09]: The last question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would not distinguish between the
private and the public health system in
[SPEAKER_09]: terms of treatment, in terms of production
is something completely different.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is important is that individual MD or
the clinic is going to go through a very
[SPEAKER_09]: strict training before and to uniform,
to have so-called national guideline,
[SPEAKER_09]: not like in Israel, but national standard
guideline.
[SPEAKER_09]: In this case, it really doesn't matter if
the patient choose this or that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a so-called green book that was
written by Israeli Ministry of Health.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a book produced by the clerks for
the clerks.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has nothing to learn from them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is speaking about imaginary patients,
about imaginary cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: They put the name of late Professor
Mishulam as a chief of the staff of this
[SPEAKER_06]: book.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I asked him, did he read the book,
he said, never, never, never, never.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with you that each country should
have its rights to use cannabis for the
[SPEAKER_06]: medical issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very sorry that providing it to the
clerks of the Ministry of Health,
[SPEAKER_06]: it does not enough because they are not
listening to the experts.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are not listening to the doctors.
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be adopted to be personalized
treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can just put this video,
because what I'm doing is cancer biology
[SPEAKER_04]: and trying different cannabinoids in
cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are working on two cancers,
breast cancer and the glauoblastoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see in breast cancer, we study the
effect of cannabinoids on the
[SPEAKER_04]: chemotherapeutic effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are either additive effects or there
are no effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very important for the clinicians
to know if they can use cannabinoids along
[SPEAKER_04]: with the other chemotherapeutics.
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal is that we will reduce the
chemotherapeutic and concentrations and
[SPEAKER_04]: instead of that, add more cannabinoids or
maybe do not use chemotherapeutics at all
[SPEAKER_04]: because you all know that
chemotherapeutics are really very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very severe adverse effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our work on glauoblastoma we are using
fresh organs, fresh tissues, cells and we
[SPEAKER_04]: are using different types of cells and
specifically we found that the stem cells,
[SPEAKER_04]: the origin of the tumor and those cells,
cancer stem cells that are more resistant
[SPEAKER_04]: to chemotherapeutics are less resistant to
cannabinoids and this will be shown in the
[SPEAKER_04]: last video that I'm going to present and
please turn on the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: The work was financed by a private
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humanity has been fighting a long battle
with one of the most challenging and fatal
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases of modern times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer is still the second global cause of
death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Due to modern oncology achievements,
not all types of cancer are deadly but
[SPEAKER_00]: some, like brain tumors called
glauoblastoma, are highly resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite more than three decades of intense
research and treatment approaches,
[SPEAKER_00]: there has been no improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: In short, the survival rate is about a
year and a half on average.
[SPEAKER_04]: National Institute of Biology is a leading
Slovenian institution in various fields of
[SPEAKER_04]: biological sciences, including
biomedicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: At NIB, our cancer biology research team
is working hard to break this gridlock and
[SPEAKER_04]: help finding the new, more efficient way
of fighting cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our approach is to use combinations,
actually a defined combination of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids along with standard of care
therapy programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In glauoblastoma, the researchers at NIB
have been trying to answer the still open
[SPEAKER_00]: question, which is the right combination
of certain cannabinoids and in what doses
[SPEAKER_00]: to target abundantly expressed receptors
on the malignant cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was found to inhibit glauoblastoma
and some other cancer cells invasion and
[SPEAKER_00]: forcing glauoblastoma cells to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having expertise in tumor cell
manipulation and analysis, we are pleased
[SPEAKER_00]: to announce new research results from the
ongoing preclinical research program that
[SPEAKER_00]: supports and directs novel cannabinoid
formulations in the treatment of
[SPEAKER_00]: glauoblastoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most aggressive and therapeutically
resistant brain tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winning combination was a certain
ratio of two cannabinoids, cannabidiol,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, and cannabigerol, CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: This mixture successfully eliminates
glauoblastoma stem cells, the most therapy
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant subpopulation of glauoblastoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: This process is called apoptosis,
so-called programmed cell death.
[SPEAKER_00]: This progress was possible in close,
excellent collaboration with neurosurgeons
[SPEAKER_00]: and oncologists on one hand and partners
from the industry on the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially the pharmaceutical company,
MGC Pharma, a statement from a
[SPEAKER_00]: representative of MGC Pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: MGC Pharmaceuticals is a multinational
pharma company with a focus on the
[SPEAKER_00]: significant potential of plant-based
medicines with a robust pipeline of phyto
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid based products.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are designed to tackle
neurodegenerative diseases, symptoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID-19 and more, where the company
places significant importance on
[SPEAKER_00]: preclinical research and drug development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our partnership with NIB was one of the
most fruitful and the ongoing preclinical
[SPEAKER_00]: research program, which supports and
directs novel cannabinoid formulations in
[SPEAKER_00]: the development of cancer treatment,
that has been one of the most interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: projects MGC has been involved in and one
that we believe in deeply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Further efforts will explore therapeutic
targets within glioma organoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are the most advanced in vitro
cancer model, mimicking the tumors in
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: These recent models are commercially
attractive for the pharma industry for
[SPEAKER_01]: drug screening that can lead to more
efficient patient treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can offer a screening platform of 3D
cancer models and we are interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: expanding a list of candidate compounds
for advanced glioma therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking forward to share insight
about advances and next generation of
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer treatment with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to collaborate with us?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all so very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very enlightening.
