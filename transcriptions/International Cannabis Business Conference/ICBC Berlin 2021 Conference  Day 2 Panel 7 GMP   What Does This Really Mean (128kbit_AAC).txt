[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the next panel here on ICPC.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are talking about the question,
what does GMP really mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we all know GMP means good
manufacturing practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's behind it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any differences within the
national regulations?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a difference between European
regulations and U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm glad to have two experts here on
the podium on the panel, which is Nina
[SPEAKER_04]: Kempf from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's owning a cannabis company there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's a CEO of Charlie's Lab and of
Hemcare, I know a lot, but the other one I
[SPEAKER_04]: was not so familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me about your two projects,
please, Nima.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, thank you for having me
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as Misha said, from Switzerland,
I'm the CEO of Swiss Hemcare and Charlie's
[SPEAKER_02]: Lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Swiss Hemcare has nothing to do with GMP.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a recreational brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow CBD, high content CBD strains in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also produce oils and sell
those oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lifestyle brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlie's Lab is the GMP part.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm sitting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started it about two and a half years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we are shortly before the
certification process by Swiss Medic,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the authority in Switzerland,
which certifies companies and
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the Charlie's Lab part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as I said, end of this year,
we should receive the certification
[SPEAKER_02]: shortly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Nima.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to my left, we have Peter Sikati,
who is, is that pronounced the right way?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sikati.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sikati, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's the CEO and the founder of Valken
Medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Valken Medical is a Danish company
specialized in extraction of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Peter's going to tell us a little bit
more about the profile of his company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, a small disclaimer,
I was presented as an expert on GMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have a commercial background,
so that will be sort of my perspective on
[SPEAKER_01]: GMP and not so much on the specialized
quality assurance or regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Valken Medical is based in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are GMP certified under the Danish law
for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a contract manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do is we support the growers in
Denmark to make extracted products that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can sell under their own brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a white label product,
THC white label product that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing to market later this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also selling bulk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we received our license here in the end
of May this year after an inspection from
[SPEAKER_01]: the Danish Medicines Agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have products in stability and
are looking forward to the results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as many of you know, we have a
different GMP regulations all over the
[SPEAKER_04]: world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within the European community,
the GMP regulations are kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: homogenized, but the national application
routines still differ from country to
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: We come to that later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nina will tell us how the application
process works in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pete will tell us how the application
process works in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I regret that we don't have
anybody from overseas here on the panel
[SPEAKER_04]: because in the United States, we have even
a different regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called CGMP.
[SPEAKER_04]: CGMP means current good manufacturing
practice, which is updated every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the European community, we have GMP
regulations, which are updated every few
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the USA, the GMP regulation is updated
every year, and it's even more stricter.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the USA also accepts the German and
the European GMP regulations, but not
[SPEAKER_04]: every country.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can look that up in the mutual
recognition agreement, the MRA agreement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Germany's GMP regulations are accepted
since 2019 from the USA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anybody who wants to know more about
that should just check the MRA
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations, and it's mentioned there
country by country which country can
[SPEAKER_04]: export medical products under GMP
regulations to the US and which national
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations the US, the FDA, does not
accept.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, then I start with the European
regulations because despite we have an
[SPEAKER_04]: official homogenization in the European
community and in Switzerland, national
[SPEAKER_04]: application routines, as I said before,
are different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Nima, please tell us what did you
have to do to get a GMP license in
[SPEAKER_04]: Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe just to say the same as Peter
said, to call it expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me personally would say that's a very too
good description.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe in five years I would call myself an
expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you need for GMP with my
knowledge, what I have now is definitely a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The right people with the right knowledge
and a bulletproof plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started, we had big ideas,
we wanted to do everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now basically it's tailored down to
something very small and specific and for
[SPEAKER_02]: what we then specifically applied.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are forms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you need to fill out by the Swiss
medic, which I said before is the
[SPEAKER_02]: authority in Switzerland which certifies
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We applied for specifically blending oils
now in different percentages, which we
[SPEAKER_02]: also defined already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Filling them in 10, 30, and 50 milliliter
bottles and capping them and labeling
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the whole GMP chain that we
applied for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything before we didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No extraction, that's what Peter's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be the customer of Peter soon,
we just realized before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can bring GMP products on the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you need the right team.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to build up the quality
management system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to know exactly what you want to
do, what product the inspector wants to
[SPEAKER_02]: know, exactly what you intend to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it realistic?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the process from the day you give
your application can take up to 18 months
[SPEAKER_02]: until they give the certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's basically the procedure in
Switzerland, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that application, as soon as you
get, as soon as you have it, you're also
[SPEAKER_04]: allowed to export to other European
countries because Switzerland is not part
[SPEAKER_04]: of the EU, but this form is accepted in
other countries as well, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, my question to Peter is you are
from a country within the EU community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Denmark is a member of the European
community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the green room before, you told me
still your application is a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: different from, for example, the German
application form.
[SPEAKER_04]: And first of all, why do we need GMP in
the cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we need GMP?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess what is GMP, which is kind of
like the question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then is it different or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say within Europe, it's pretty
clear to me what it is because the
[SPEAKER_01]: European Commission and the EMA have set
out the guidelines, which is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: hydraulics and the directives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's up to each country to implement
those directives in their own law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is also the ICH guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically the whole framework for and
all the rules and guidelines and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations exists and are the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to cannabis, I guess the
whole purpose of GMP is taking care of the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients really and making sure that there
is consistency, traceability, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as cannabis is a medicine and it's a
prescription medicine that's being
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribed to people with illnesses,
then of course it should be produced under
[SPEAKER_01]: GMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in Denmark, we have a special law
governing medical cannabis because it does
[SPEAKER_01]: differ from other medicine that just
applies to the medicine law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is partly also
that we don't have to go through clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really the catch with medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it really differs from
conventional medicine, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: or pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the application process in Denmark and
the inspection from the Danish Medicines
[SPEAKER_01]: Agency is very much the same as it is for
other companies producing medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything we do is embedded in the
hydraulics and in the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do a GMP inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: The license we get is the same as a GMP
certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just under the Danish cannabis law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The catch is, I would say, when you have
your GMP certification as a manufacturer
[SPEAKER_01]: is the product registration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where country to country,
it really differs a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in Denmark, as an example,
under the Danish program, you can produce
[SPEAKER_01]: a product under GMP, a flower or an oil,
and you can file a product registration
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's approved, it's on the market
and it's on the pharmacy shelf,
[SPEAKER_01]: branded under your company brand,
and the doctor prescribes it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we have gel capsules on the
market in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still magistral prepared cannabis
on the market, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we are going to see more products
coming into the market, it's also going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a lot more common for the doctors to
prescribe cannabis because they have more
[SPEAKER_01]: options.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Germany, I'm not an expert on it yet,
but I know that it has to go through some
[SPEAKER_01]: steps in a magistral process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cannot just be registered and put on
the pharmacy shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few additional steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really where it differs a lot
within the European Union, the last step
[SPEAKER_01]: of the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you say, Peter, that this is one of
the reasons why Denmark, meanwhile,
[SPEAKER_04]: has, I think, six cannabis producers and
the law is not as long implemented as it
[SPEAKER_04]: was in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's much newer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And is it easier to start in the industry
due to the regulations or to the
[SPEAKER_04]: registration, to the cannabis medicine
registration?
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you say it's easier to make a
startup in Denmark?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say nothing is easy when it comes
to starting a cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think most people in this room will
recognize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the framework we have in Denmark
is more transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the room we have to conduct commercial
operations is probably also more
[SPEAKER_01]: transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I think I heard earlier, there's only
really three licenses for cultivation and
[SPEAKER_01]: some extraction that has been granted in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in Denmark, I think there were at
a time about 50 companies that had gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: a development license, which means that
you are allowed to practice sort of with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis until you're ready for your
inspection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So easier, that's a relative word.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say more transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nima, a short look in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I see all those CBD productions in
Switzerland, I see some of them are GMP,
[SPEAKER_04]: some of them are not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what advantages do you have as a GMP
producer in Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it depends what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it flower production?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if it's flower production,
it can currently only be for export.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that already paints the picture for
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only have small, small patients for
certain oils, which are produced under
[SPEAKER_02]: GMP.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do need that, plus the narcotic
license, because it's still a narcotic in
[SPEAKER_02]: Switzerland, the THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD is a narcotic in Switzerland?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, CBD is basically free.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends then what kind of products you
put it on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends then under what regulations it
falls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the whole novel food story comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I'll just use that example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the moment, as we speak,
many oils, CBD oils under 0.2% have been
[SPEAKER_02]: taken out from the stores from the
pharmacists, the Cantonal pharmacists,
[SPEAKER_02]: which have the power to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just last week, they came to a store
where our product was inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a different approach of
registering the product and also the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: documentation, which we already have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we don't have the GMP
certification yet, but 95% of the SOPs are
[SPEAKER_02]: already in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're already working like GMP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our products do cost more because the
employees cost more, the QPs cost a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the costs are very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we talked to the Cantonal
pharmacist and showed him all the
[SPEAKER_02]: paperwork we have, at the end,
our oils are still on the shelf now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that that is a major
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows that there is some security
behind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also understand we want to bring
safe products to the shelves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And generally, also, we speak about two
very different markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in Switzerland, CBD is also a
recreational product, but also a medical
[SPEAKER_04]: product sold in pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Denmark, there is actually,
in your company, we only talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: medical-grade products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what would you say, in Denmark,
what's about the domestic market?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about exporting all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what is about the domestic market?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's about selling GMP products in
Danish pharmacies?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that already a big market there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, we're obviously also focused
on export because Denmark is a small
[SPEAKER_01]: country with only about 6 million people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a huge market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think when we're talking markets,
it also comes down to the doctor's
[SPEAKER_01]: perception of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge in Denmark is that the
doctors don't really understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're very reluctant to prescribing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead, we have some cannabis clinics
that are specialized in prescribing it and
[SPEAKER_01]: confident with having patients and
starting them up on medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing at the hospitals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have doctors that are using
medical cannabis and prescribing it out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seen some products on the Danish
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was an oil that was imported from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on the market for about,
I think it was two years or a little less
[SPEAKER_01]: than two years before it was unfortunately
taken off the market again.
[SPEAKER_01]: In three years and two quarters,
I think the total cannabis sales was about
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 million euros in Denmark, which is
definitely not insignificant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a reimbursement program
that's 50% for patients of the price they
[SPEAKER_01]: pay at the pharmacy and 100% if you're
terminally ill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we will see over time when more
products come into the market because now
[SPEAKER_01]: there's really only one, which is the gel
capsules.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start to see that the doctors get
more confident in prescribing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patients are showing good effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess that's when it will start to
be more normalized and a general
[SPEAKER_01]: perception in the public that this is a
thing that works for many patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when the acceptance will come.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I hope is that if we manage to do
that in Denmark as sort of a platform that
[SPEAKER_01]: works well, other countries within the EU
will look at us as a case and take some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the knowledge we have created to open up
the markets there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Switzerland, Nima, it's a kind of a
little bit different situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a very big recreational CBD
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have kind of a small medical CBD
market in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you told before, you have the
possibility to export GMP products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any idea or would it be possible
to export GMP CBD flour and products to
[SPEAKER_04]: German pharmacies?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything going on in this
direction?
[SPEAKER_02]: So me personally, since we do not produce
the GMP flours, I'm not really 100% up to
[SPEAKER_02]: date with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would now assume that if you can
register a medicinal product, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: flour with certain content of CBD and THC,
and it meets all the parameters,
[SPEAKER_02]: then I don't see really an issue with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I was thinking in German
pharmacies, we have a very small range of
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Switzerland has a very big range of
CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of patients in Germany say,
oh, I don't find the right CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wonder why no company had the idea
yet to import medical grade cannabis with
[SPEAKER_04]: a GMP production certificate to Germany,
because it's also paid better in the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Switzerland, there's a very big
competition on the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can export to a German pharmacy
or to a German medical market,
[SPEAKER_04]: the prices are much more stable than what
you have in Switzerland right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't know anything going on in
this direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about CBD flower production or
extraction in Denmark?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that also a big thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can't really speak for the retail
market or the cosmetics of fast-moving
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer goods, because we're not at all
involved in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're only focused on medical and
prescription medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that context, with CBD,
that's also a product that's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: available from us too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So extracting CBD flower that's cultivated
under GACP and GMP as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is prescription medicine in
Denmark, and it's not allowed as a retail
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's prescription medicine in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that also differs from the rest of the
European market kind of, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's obviously opportunities to
buy it online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, it's not allowed under any novel
food or anything in Denmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see products that's extracted from
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hemp seed oil branded as CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit of a gray zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know much about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not a huge thing in Denmark,
this retail CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we see, like two countries and two very
different circumstances, as I say.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd really like to go a lot deeper
into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But time runs away.
[SPEAKER_04]: We only have, I think, four minutes left
for this panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the time for the audience for
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anybody who has questions to me or the
panelists, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the time for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need my exercise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Renan Mignon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from the Holland Green Science Group.
[SPEAKER_03]: You asked one question, Michael,
is why do we have GMP anyway?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't think of these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was not an answer, a straight
answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the panel can answer that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually believe that I did mention
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, why we have GMP, that's because of
the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rules and regulations embedded in
directives from the European Commission
[SPEAKER_01]: and the EMA to protect the patients and
take care of patient safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So GMP, I mean, it's rules that you comply
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the way you build your company based
on those guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's traceability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's patient safety, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he was asking if it's the same for
the recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have a recreational market in
Denmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can maybe hear over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can answer this question.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, the recreational market which
is hopefully going to be built up in
[SPEAKER_04]: Switzerland is planned to be GMC,
which is not as high as GMP.
Over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Nima, maybe this is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the difference between what you do
than what standard pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: companies do for producing syrups or
medicinal shampoos, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you are only doing blending and
packaging, as I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the difference in the
regulations if you do it with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: based products?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are just purely concentrating on the
filling, capping, blending, because for us
[SPEAKER_02]: in Switzerland, that was the most clear
way we can go without going into any gray
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to have a bulletproof
business plan and not hope, OK,
[SPEAKER_02]: novel food will kick in, will not kick in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, we can fill in cap than
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be cannabis at the end
of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like plan B in case everything goes
the wrong way, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we chose that strategy in case that
route doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our lab also does analytics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also focus on analytics on different
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working a lot on those because we
believe in the different compositions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also have two other
technologies which we will implement in
[SPEAKER_02]: the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are purely focusing on that,
especially in the cannabis side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I'm allowed to add, I think anybody
should know when it comes to GMP,
[SPEAKER_04]: the packaging is the thing you have to
invest the most money in.
[SPEAKER_04]: The production, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't make the production yourself,
you just have to do the packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the packaging is a very big
investment, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any more questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have time for one more question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, you are very comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, then we are, again, the ones who saved
the time for the next panelist.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we catch up the five minutes we lost
before, I would suggest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thank you, Peter, for being here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, Nima, for being here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we got very good information on
GMP and GMP practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe let me ask you a very,
very final question.
[SPEAKER_04]: How important is GMP to have cannabis
accepted by the traditional pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_04]: industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I believe that it's more the doctors
and the patient safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So GMP is vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being a doctor, having an ill patient with
a serious disease or being under
[SPEAKER_01]: chemotherapy or whatever, it's vital for
them that cannabis medicine is produced
[SPEAKER_01]: under GMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that's the whole concept and
the whole idea is patient safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you agree if I say without GMP,
cannabis medicine has no chance to be
[SPEAKER_04]: accepted on a broad range?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Nima.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy the rest of ICPC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy the evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
