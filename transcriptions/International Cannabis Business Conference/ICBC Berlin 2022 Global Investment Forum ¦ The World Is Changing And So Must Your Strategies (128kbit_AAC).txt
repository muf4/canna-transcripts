[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot's changed here recently in the
last three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before cannabis was awesome just because
it was cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got like global market shifting,
different changes in policies,
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain issues that we've never even
seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great we can all be in a room again
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yay, that's kind of an exciting thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick little disclaimer I have to
give, I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a CPA,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an investment analyst,
I'm a fund manager of Multiverse Capital,
[SPEAKER_00]: own a variety of companies, but make sure
that you use good lawyers, good tax
[SPEAKER_00]: accountants because at the end of the day
this is in the United States federally
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Internationally completely in contrary to
all drug policies and laws and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking rules in different jurisdictions
so you have to know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot guess and those professionals
they're kind of guessing too but a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more educated than some of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just make sure to use some of those
professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do swear often and just in the nature
and if I do offend your company or country
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just based on the industry,
it's nothing personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick little high level of background,
I've been in the space for almost 16 years
[SPEAKER_00]: from farm country in Wisconsin all the way
to being a linguist for the military,
[SPEAKER_00]: got hurt, went to Colorado to some
beautiful mountains in 2006 right when
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado was changing from a medical
program that allowed commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Colorado was the first state in the
United States that allowed you to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: profit with medical cannabis in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: California 2000 or I'm sorry 1996 the
Compassionate Care Act, first medical
[SPEAKER_00]: state in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: but we were the first ones that we could
do it as a business not as a nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little behold we were also the first that
allowed adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2012 we legalized regulate marijuana
like alcohol, Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014 we had the first legal adult use
sales where you could have a company
[SPEAKER_00]: profiting you know from adult use cannabis
and that day one of our stores was the
[SPEAKER_00]: third to open and that was the day like we
had lawyers on retainers it was the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time it wasn't medical and like if the
feds were going to come in that was the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did millions of dollars in revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado's already done 10 billion dollars
in adult use sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been part of an adult use business
for over eight years in Colorado profiting
[SPEAKER_00]: from cannabis, violating federal law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: So have been around seen a lot so I'm not
guessing in some of these assumptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Global cannabis in 2022 some of the
projections when you think about last year
[SPEAKER_00]: over 35 billion dollars in revenue global
cannabis medical and adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think of like where was that
revenue?
[SPEAKER_00]: 88% in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean Canada 9% I mean they barely like
top out around 3 billion U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian it sounds a lot better but you
know and it used to be we had to be
[SPEAKER_00]: careful talking about dollars and euros
but right now we're all the same which is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hilarious sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little touchy but like now is a good
time to buy stuff in Europe compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: typically but then the rest of the fucking
world 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1% and here I started working
international in 2014 in Canada then
[SPEAKER_00]: Denmark and that first crazy German tender
then winning like Danish companies and
[SPEAKER_00]: then Portugal and like South Africa like
massive expansion 1%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not to say like the rest of the world
doesn't matter because it does but what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the United States similar to
like the honor that we have to give to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands for allowing their seed
breeder programs and really starting the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that just went from like cheese
or skunk or whatever you know typical
[SPEAKER_00]: things especially if there's UK people
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like the first to allow certain
things the United States is taking
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer culture to a whole new level of
like products edibles beverages
[SPEAKER_00]: international medical is all about
compassionate use which means it can just
[SPEAKER_00]: be an API an active pharmaceutical
ingredient flour or bulk oil all
[SPEAKER_00]: compounding has to happen in pharmacy so
it's not like I'm gonna make vape
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridges in Portugal and sell them to
German medical it's like that doesn't work
[SPEAKER_00]: that way in the US it does but we've get
we're really the guinea pig market like
[SPEAKER_00]: what products work what do consumers like
what packaging marketing and as we
[SPEAKER_00]: navigate in the United States since it's
federally illegal each states like its own
[SPEAKER_00]: little country violating federal law but
using state laws to do it so the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that the rest of the world can learn we
know what people like I don't care if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're European Asian American South
African it doesn't matter we're people now
[SPEAKER_00]: there are certain cultures that have
different things really might like salty
[SPEAKER_00]: or they might like sweet different taste
profiles but at the end of the day we're
[SPEAKER_00]: people what delivery methods work what
types of like hashes have been popular and
[SPEAKER_00]: what will a program allow because some
states in the US they would only allow
[SPEAKER_00]: like smokable flour Georgia 5% THC oil or
less you know so like each little place is
[SPEAKER_00]: different so you always have to adapt your
business plan to what that place is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: do now in the United States it's kind of
like I said each states like its own
[SPEAKER_00]: little country we only have a couple
little holdouts but and and again sorry
[SPEAKER_00]: for the last couple years you know the
America show like our soap opera has been
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty dramatic lots of like page turners
there and sorry if we kind of look like
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous in the past and you know women
can still vote at least in America you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we got that going for us so even
though it looks a little crazy and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening when we focus on the cannabis
industry from like Colorado California
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these new adult-use states some of
the ones that are on the cusp of changing
[SPEAKER_00]: and when each state does this and
legalizes it's a new market opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can't grow cannabis at a legal
operation in California and sell it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different state everything I produce in a
country in the state I have to sell in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state new crossing state lines when that
changes we always have to think like
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural vectors like this is an
agricultural commodity and I'm a farm kid
[SPEAKER_00]: like I love growing cannabis but I love
growing tomatoes and acanacea and when we
[SPEAKER_00]: look at other agricultural industries what
works for production methodologies indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: is really popular right now because we
were illegal are illegal so we went
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors to hide but what other plants do
we commercially produce on a viable scale
[SPEAKER_00]: in warehouses or in little growth chambers
or with the fancy LED lights greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor our operations I have one
operation in Colombia I could literally
[SPEAKER_00]: supply the whole world with cannabis from
but indoors high cost of capital high cost
[SPEAKER_00]: of construction high operational costs
when you do hydroponic or other things a
[SPEAKER_00]: system failure it's like life support and
the plants die but when you really think
[SPEAKER_00]: of like what works and like where could I
produce cannabis where I have a better
[SPEAKER_00]: climate temperature like cheaper land
better taxes that's where cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to come from long term so in the US
pre-federal legalization patchwork little
[SPEAKER_00]: framework eventually where in the US is
going to be cheapest to mass produce and
[SPEAKER_00]: sell and then after international
legalization happens that's where the
[SPEAKER_00]: countries that are closest to the equator
will be the winners like we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop growing pineapples in warehouses in
Germany to have pineapples we'll bring
[SPEAKER_00]: them from where it's cheap to produce but
currently that's not allowed but the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States is definitely a model we can
learn from so international medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis there's so much supply from some
of these lower cost of production nations
[SPEAKER_00]: you know even like Portugal great in the
European Union but when you look at South
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa Thailand potentially moving forward
Colombia Peru some of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries the cost of production there I
can make a kilo of EUG compliant cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for less than 10 euros and then here we're
talking about allowing it for 10 euros a
[SPEAKER_00]: gram and like setting certain standards
and you're like hmm there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: massive disconnect and then over supply
currently happening internationally
[SPEAKER_00]: because without a doctor's prescription in
the US it's doctors recommendations
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can't give a prescription for
cannabis unless it's Epidiolex out of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know Marinol like other synthetic
cannabinoids so international without
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors being educated about the benefits
of cannabis and being willing to write a
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription patients don't get it I mean
Germany didn't even do 350 million euros
[SPEAKER_00]: in sales last year of medical and it's the
largest medical market in the United or in
[SPEAKER_00]: the EU and in the world outside of the
United States but when you think of 350
[SPEAKER_00]: million euros for all of the medical
patients that are happening here Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: just to put in perspective did close to 3
billion last year that's with 6 million
[SPEAKER_00]: people you got close to 90 million people
here so it's just a matter of time but we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do doctor education we have to
come up with a federal and international
[SPEAKER_00]: medical system before adult use that
that's exactly what we did in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States in each and every state that went
from medical to adult use here's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: stat for you a hundred percent of the time
in the United States if you had a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: license in a state you're first in line
for adult use doesn't mean you're making a
[SPEAKER_00]: ton of money sometimes in those medical
days but if you're willing to bleed and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can hold that position you will most
likely be rewarded internationally so
[SPEAKER_00]: those three crappy companies no offense to
you all if you're here that have the
[SPEAKER_00]: production licenses in Germany depending
on how supply is going to happen they
[SPEAKER_00]: might be first in line for this so there's
a time and a place when holding a position
[SPEAKER_00]: can be great but if you can't withstand
the market pressures it will crush you
[SPEAKER_00]: like a bad short or a bad investment now
with international adult use happening
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got a couple examples Spanish social
clubs the Netherlands we have Luxembourg
[SPEAKER_00]: with what they had planned to do that then
couldn't happen and now in Germany and
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany really really unique in how
they're planning on doing adult use the
[SPEAKER_00]: implementation is going to be the problem
because you have all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: international organizations from the
International Narcotics Control Board the
[SPEAKER_00]: UN with three treaties like the 1961
single convention treaty on psychotropic
[SPEAKER_00]: substances kind of a mouthful and the 71
and the 1978 Indies Indian Pharmacies Act
[SPEAKER_00]: there's all these different policies that
kind of go over this so where is supply
[SPEAKER_00]: going to come from like we don't know that
because not only in Germany and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to legalize and are still working
on it's not just like the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: doing their own thing or Canada doing
their own thing or Uruguay doing their own
[SPEAKER_00]: thing your members of the European Union
and that's actually the biggest problem if
[SPEAKER_00]: you violate UN law what are they going to
do sanctions this isn't Russia with
[SPEAKER_00]: Ukraine right now it's like all Canada
legalized recreational like let's cut off
[SPEAKER_00]: Swift to Canada like didn't happen we were
terrified with Uruguay Uruguay was like
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado in 2014 they legalized adult use
and we're like oh and they're like a small
[SPEAKER_00]: little country like crackdown nothing
nothing so you know the European Union is
[SPEAKER_00]: really what could crackdown because there
are a lot of policies there so first
[SPEAKER_00]: decriminalization is huge and how we could
do this home grow isn't as hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate and easier based on like what
countries would allow but the issue with
[SPEAKER_00]: home grow just like home brewing it's
super intensive you have to like wash all
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottles have the carboys do all the
labeling like how many people do that and
[SPEAKER_00]: do it well and it's also can be an
environmental catastrophe it's kind of bad
[SPEAKER_00]: for the industry but if that's what it
takes to legalize it it's better I mean if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grow your own tobacco or brew your
own beer why don't we all do that because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're convenient little creatures and we
like things easy like if I can buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: six-pack for five euros ten euros why
would I actually go to the trouble of
[SPEAKER_00]: brewing beer but people do it and that
craft stuff is great but that's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the keys that we could get
international done and you think about all
[SPEAKER_00]: these organizations that kind of govern
this especially in the United States like
[SPEAKER_00]: the DEA with their very cute little logo
like kind of assholes and then America we
[SPEAKER_00]: were the world police we're like America
and when we pretty much went after medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and cannabis just to get rid of
hemp back in the 30s a few US white
[SPEAKER_00]: asshole men all dead thank God but their
policies exist we caused this and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry like it's one of those like
neoliberalism like way too early and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like oh let's make hemp illegal but by
doing it thinking about how cannabis was
[SPEAKER_00]: so bad you know Jack Herrera one of our
heroes in the space like his book the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emperor wears no clothes if you want to
understand how cannabis got illegal look
[SPEAKER_00]: into that because it was never about
cannabis being dangerous for like our
[SPEAKER_00]: health it was already a part of different
pharmaceutical kind of regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical compacts way early in the 1850s
and one of the reasons cannabis isn't that
[SPEAKER_00]: sexy to pharmaceutical companies is
because there's this thing called the
[SPEAKER_00]: safety profile when you make a
standardized drug if you make something
[SPEAKER_00]: new and you own it and it passes that
safety profile your Viagra for that
[SPEAKER_00]: industry for 20 plus years it passed that
safety profile in the 1850s so there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing that sexy about owning cannabis
per se but when you think about this like
[SPEAKER_00]: whole scheme of regulations from like UN
drug law European Union drug law how these
[SPEAKER_00]: compacts work between countries navigating
this is terrifying as an investor but if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do it well you're gonna be in a good
position now the international economics
[SPEAKER_00]: control board not a fan of anything that's
happening but what the fuck are they doing
[SPEAKER_00]: about it they're complaining they're not
enforcing they're not cracking down but
[SPEAKER_00]: would they especially in the European
Union if supply starts happening from one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the key ways people are thinking about
doing this using this as an example would
[SPEAKER_00]: be like okay I'm producing EUG like GACP
compliant and EUG compliant cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say Columbia I sell it to a medical
importer in Germany that medical
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor accepts that product but now
it's in a country that's legal so now we
[SPEAKER_00]: can label it adult use cannabis not
exactly at all but that's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: quickest and easiest ways that most people
think that this is gonna happen but we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be very very careful about these
because they haven't enforced yet but if
[SPEAKER_00]: they did what it would cost to the
industry could be catastrophic but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's gonna happen if countries you
know prevent youth access do proper
[SPEAKER_00]: education these are things like safety and
security not allowing like foreign crimes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are gonna really allow this European
Union is kind of huge and the big thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to just mention here it's like
tobacco is estimated to be 263 billion
[SPEAKER_00]: euros in the EU alcohol 467 of that about
37 percent beer in about 40 percent wine
[SPEAKER_00]: and spirits and the rest is kind of like a
lot of these new selsers and different
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are changing but I love how
they said that the illicit cannabis market
[SPEAKER_00]: was 9 billion last year the DEA used to
say that the illegal cannabis market in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States was 50 billion dollars
it's closer to like 200 billion in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States and it's probably closer to
300 billion here in Europe but how do they
[SPEAKER_00]: have good accurate reporting on this based
on crimes and costs it's enormous and like
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking school over here not a school in
Europe in America but when we see some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these changes happen like what opportunity
this will be like the second largest
[SPEAKER_00]: market in the world the US we got a head
start on you you have more people though
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's gonna be a lot easier to regulate
this when you do it from an EU standpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: than like state by state each little state
guessing how to do this but learn from
[SPEAKER_00]: what we've done in the US to do this I
mean you've had some major strides for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical here in the EU but what has that
led to in terms of revenue valuations
[SPEAKER_00]: growth propositions it's been great for
patients disabled vet myself that's how I
[SPEAKER_00]: got into this space we always have to
focus on the patients but we're all people
[SPEAKER_00]: we all have these endocannabinoid systems
so who are gonna be the ones that are like
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaders in supplying this big thing I
always kind of say it's like when you
[SPEAKER_00]: think about the world and others have it's
like where are these key positions and
[SPEAKER_00]: where do they matter you got one shot to
put your pieces down on the board unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a whole shit ton of capital if so
we should talk don't go into this game
[SPEAKER_00]: alone the due diligence is insane which
I'll get into knowing what's like a good
[SPEAKER_00]: investment for people that have been
around for over a decade I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of like a similar business plan
other times you might not have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: like unique deal flow so you have to know
where and how to put that capital but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: always knowing the rules to play the game
and each one's gonna be different just
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can do one thing in Jamaica or
one thing in South Africa doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're gonna be able to do it
everywhere so it's not the same as
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional business but it does follow a
lot of the same kind of histories so why
[SPEAKER_00]: is cannabis like super sexy for investing
now we're the largest growing emerging
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in the history of the world
fastest and largest bigger than dot-coms
[SPEAKER_00]: because dot-coms didn't have the internet
to like boost their company or influencers
[SPEAKER_00]: to get people to buy products back then
huge how long did it take the alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: industry to evolve how long did it take
the tobacco industry to evolve we got 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years max on this and where are that
timeline has started so if you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: Jameson you want to be Philip you want to
be British American tobacco now is the
[SPEAKER_00]: frickin time and you don't want to start
little startup companies for 500k here 500
[SPEAKER_00]: years there it's all about like mergers
and acquisitions and we've seen copious
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of that in the United States but
now is the time that when companies are
[SPEAKER_00]: bleeding they used to think I'm worth a
hundred million you're actually probably
[SPEAKER_00]: worth 20 so like you can get more for your
buck right now than you could ever before
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to some of the public
companies they're lowest lower than we've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever seen and granted public market
investing is crazy like the public versus
[SPEAKER_00]: private and trying to choose which ones
but if there's ever been a time where like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like that thing with a tree like the
best time to plant a tree 20 years ago the
[SPEAKER_00]: next best time is today private capital we
don't have institutional capital that can
[SPEAKER_00]: flow into this because they're too risk
adverse to like being the first in the
[SPEAKER_00]: water that's why a lot of giant banks and
social institutions they're not into this
[SPEAKER_00]: yet so I private offices family family
offices multifamily offices so so vital
[SPEAKER_00]: for the growth of this industry a lot of
companies are struggling though because
[SPEAKER_00]: like in the United States we have a weird
tax code called IRC 280e we can't deduct
[SPEAKER_00]: our business costs so let's say I do 10
million in revenue 5 million in cost I
[SPEAKER_00]: should pay taxes on 5 million sometimes
I'll pay taxes on 7 to 9 million even if I
[SPEAKER_00]: only you know had 5 million in costs it's
absolutely ridiculous they can't scale as
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly as possible they over projected
their markets thinking like oh I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get this Colombian production license and
I'll supply the whole world so I'll put 70
[SPEAKER_00]: million euros into this thing and it's
like well how can it be scalable and how
[SPEAKER_00]: can a business grow as market demand grows
but the supply chain issues that happened
[SPEAKER_00]: during coronavirus I mean the cost of
steel for me the cost of glass I used to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a big fan of like new buildings but now
being able to retrofit things and get to
[SPEAKER_00]: market faster the same thing that I used
to be able to build three years ago is
[SPEAKER_00]: about three times more money to build the
exact same thing today and takes about
[SPEAKER_00]: twice as long which is you're like oh shit
that's only three years what change
[SPEAKER_00]: coronavirus supply chains employment side
and now as we're starting to rebuild
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is in such high demand that
suppliers actually can't even keep up
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're all startups too like
every single company that's growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: like all of that original revenue like 35
billion last year almost 200 billion in
[SPEAKER_00]: ancillary services for real estate
construction legal consulting investment
[SPEAKER_00]: due diligence everyone's backed up right
now so the due diligence that most
[SPEAKER_00]: investors miss on a normal project like is
this a unique market vantage like what's
[SPEAKER_00]: the true valuation of this company like
due diligence is a whole new level now one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that I can say to investors just
take that word cannabis out of the deal
[SPEAKER_00]: flow equation is this a viable business
not just because it's a sexy new thing can
[SPEAKER_00]: it function independently of being
cannabis and like oh it's a CBD company
[SPEAKER_00]: and like I've seen that in gas stations I
should invest into that not a good idea
[SPEAKER_00]: don't buy those products at gas stations
but when it comes to like the products
[SPEAKER_00]: that they protect their IP what's that
team do they have the ability to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: execute on this is it a diverse team in
the United States we have the worst social
[SPEAKER_00]: justice problem in cannabis in the history
of ever I mean cannabis was made illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: by saying like Hispanics and African
Americans were gonna like rape white women
[SPEAKER_00]: and reefer madness and insanity and then
meanwhile almost 90% of cannabis arrests
[SPEAKER_00]: historically in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_00]: are not white people but we use cannabis
the same across the board so now there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: big social equity programs which are huge
in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_00]: for like getting licenses and
jurisdictions if you had a past cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: crime at a company worth 247 billion in a
cash acquisition that now the only way you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get those sorts of companies is if
somebody or one of the original owners had
[SPEAKER_00]: a drug crime but I've also lost a company
because someone had a joint 13 years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: and didn't disclose it and lost a license
in one of the most competitive markets in
[SPEAKER_00]: the u.s.
[SPEAKER_00]: so we've got this shifting kind of policy
but in the EU when we polled people like
[SPEAKER_00]: what was most important social equity is
so low of like helping to like get people
[SPEAKER_00]: out of jail for like nonviolent cannabis
arrests having diversity parameters not
[SPEAKER_00]: just like rich white guy companies but
like females minorities like diversity is
[SPEAKER_00]: our strength in this industry and if
you're not having companies like that have
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse boards and others investments not
gonna flow easy either but the nice thing
[SPEAKER_00]: now is that ESG like environmental
socially governed companies it's sexy like
[SPEAKER_00]: some funds have certain mandates just to
invest into companies that have
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental and social mandates and even
our fund we won't invest into companies
[SPEAKER_00]: unless they have a diverse board so really
think about how to diversify not just to
[SPEAKER_00]: look good and get investment because it's
the right fucking thing to do I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: realistically like this is a new industry
we can create it how we want and we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to follow the same past framework and
depending on where your capital is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from like diversifying capital diversifies
risk a diversified team I'm a biologist
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity is totally our strength in these
businesses a lot of them are failing
[SPEAKER_00]: though because remember this is a startup
industry full of startup companies
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes I'm like I've been around doing
this for a decade and a half I'm like man
[SPEAKER_00]: did we pass startup phase yet or not but
we're always thinking like lean and agile
[SPEAKER_00]: I cleaned a toilet last week in an office
it was dirty it's like sometimes you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do everything when you're in these
businesses but like no company is perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're always growing the dot-com
bubble was enormous the cannabis bubble is
[SPEAKER_00]: even worse because it's so sexy and like
good but there's not enough due diligence
[SPEAKER_00]: and history and track record but there are
for some of us that have been around this
[SPEAKER_00]: long so when you think about like public
versus private you know I always make fun
[SPEAKER_00]: of tillery and always will just change my
mind it's gonna be hard but it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: raise money shit like it's really hard to
raise capital if I go public and talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about all this cool stuff money can just
flow because different investors can do
[SPEAKER_00]: that like they can get in and they can get
out but private capital on average has had
[SPEAKER_00]: a 27x return versus public even in the
times when no laser but like that bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: trough there that was rona like remember
like March 17th like we're all in PJs and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit that's when I was awake for four days
wearing a t-rex shirt and like watching
[SPEAKER_00]: the Canadian public companies just tank
and just buying them like there was
[SPEAKER_00]: literally no tomorrow like investing my
parents like retirement funds I'm like oh
[SPEAKER_00]: this is so I'm like this is risky but I'm
like I think I know what I'm doing we made
[SPEAKER_00]: massive crushes especially before Biden
got elected and this looked good we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually are lower today as a public stock
index than we were during the crash of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020 which is crazy and in the US like our
companies like who non cannabis companies
[SPEAKER_00]: but most Canadian companies on average
listed over 40% down year-to-date even if
[SPEAKER_00]: you were to take a million euros and put a
hundred thousand euros into like the 10
[SPEAKER_00]: MSOs in the US to set it and forget it
like now is the time even if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: diversify into public but diversifying
into privates that are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired by these giants once they get
back on their feet those are those 27x
[SPEAKER_00]: exits it's not about like being Philip
Morris sometimes it's about being bought
[SPEAKER_00]: by them or who's going to be bought by
them first and that's what we really try
[SPEAKER_00]: to strategically outline so what do you
got to do to beat some of these odds let's
[SPEAKER_00]: just check on this rambling okay got a
couple more what do you got to do to beat
[SPEAKER_00]: the odds now as an investor or a company
you have to be unique everyone does this
[SPEAKER_00]: now like it's not this isn't 2014 you
can't just list and think you're gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy or Aurora or build a giant
greenhouse in the tundra and think you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna supply the world with cannabis
thought like it was a good idea sorry
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't work out very well financial models
like I don't spend time with like sexy
[SPEAKER_00]: models I spend time I fall asleep with
financial models like if I can't see it
[SPEAKER_00]: and understand it through an excel sheet
it doesn't make sense to me if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: two-page financial model I'm probably not
gonna read it where are your assumptions
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from are they vetted have you
thought about waste disposal have you
[SPEAKER_00]: thought about taxes have you thought about
every aspect of pre-construction building
[SPEAKER_00]: entitlement sewer permits three-phase
power upgrades regulatory regime things
[SPEAKER_00]: testing costs is your price four thousand
a kilo for the next five years if so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not turning to the next page sensitivity
so if you don't know how to model your
[SPEAKER_00]: companies and you're trying to raise
capital start on that now if you're an
[SPEAKER_00]: investor get some help with like reviewing
these financial models even some
[SPEAKER_00]: independent due diligence confidentially
just to review their models and be like do
[SPEAKER_00]: some stress tests on those what happens I
didn't see the Ukraine thing happening at
[SPEAKER_00]: all I thought it was just like Putin
flexing and then all of a sudden like our
[SPEAKER_00]: Ukrainian hemp companies are all like whoo
that's okay war we didn't think about that
[SPEAKER_00]: what other things could happen now there's
eight billion people it's a volatile world
[SPEAKER_00]: prices are going up they're never gonna
come down it's not gonna find more natural
[SPEAKER_00]: gas somewhere and like solve all of our
problems like hit peak oil in the 70s
[SPEAKER_00]: goods are gonna keep getting more and more
expensive we're gonna have more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: issues old industries are turning to
dinosaurs but you have to have robust good
[SPEAKER_00]: financial models real estate if I knew
what I knew now I'd be a billionaire from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis real estate back in the day in
the US each little city or places you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't typically apply for a license
without compliant real estate with an
[SPEAKER_00]: owner that says it's fine to do this less
than 1% of real estate is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant for cannabis typically
production manufacturing retail are they
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna sign up not all cities say yes so
you can't just think every little place is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be good but real estate will be and
has been so vital it was for our Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses for the Danish licenses for the
Portuguese licenses for the German ones
[SPEAKER_00]: back in 2015 real estate if you're in
cannabis you're gonna have to have a real
[SPEAKER_00]: estate if you're in real estate why be
working and doing investments that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting six percent on like I can't
guarantee it but I'd get you 18% on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis real estate all day every day and
it's a problem because you got the UK
[SPEAKER_00]: foreign you know crimes act that I can't
take tons of money out of the UK even
[SPEAKER_00]: investing into real estate in the United
States just being leased to a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: company so like being able to like get
good capital real estate especially for
[SPEAKER_00]: debt is important these opportunity zones
so massive internationally as well like in
[SPEAKER_00]: the US if I put a business in an
opportunity zone and I spend 25 million
[SPEAKER_00]: euros building that thing out if it's
opportunity zone the investors don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay capital gains taxes on where the
money came from if it sits there for five
[SPEAKER_00]: to seven years depending on the
jurisdiction they don't have to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: capital gains on that investment if you
can tell that story to your investors and
[SPEAKER_00]: save them taxes on past gains and future
gains of you I don't even care if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like raising baby elephants or whatever it
might be like tell the story to your
[SPEAKER_00]: investors and make it lucrative not just
for what you think's good but what's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be good for them you know there's all
these pitfalls you can plan so much there
[SPEAKER_00]: can be all these business plans the world
changed so quickly though that in trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to adapt with that now and having robust
supply chains what if this vendor fails
[SPEAKER_00]: how am I gonna scale not building out too
big and taking over the world bite by bite
[SPEAKER_00]: by bite and even if you'd like like dude
surfing even if you do the best thing ever
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a random-ass little jet skis that
are just gonna like hitch out of the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you deal with that like are you
like if you were sponsoring surfers I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't want to sponsor one I'd sponsor
six of them what if one of them be eaten
[SPEAKER_00]: by a shark what you know you have to have
diversity in your planning and now is the
[SPEAKER_00]: time like that sense of urgency to get
either get into this industry because
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise if you wait a few years yeah a
little less risky we'll know what's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: happen in Germany we know it's gonna
happen in other places but now is
[SPEAKER_00]: literally the time where if you can
diversify into the sector it's the only
[SPEAKER_00]: thing worth doing be it in your country
your jurisdiction if you supply even
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging or something like how do you get
into this industry if alcohol is close to
[SPEAKER_00]: half a trillion dollars every year in the
EU tobacco over a quarter trillion I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is easily here gonna be a quarter
trillion to a half a billion trillion if
[SPEAKER_00]: not more once this is established but you
only get a new industry like this once
[SPEAKER_00]: dot-com happened Industrial Revolution
happened cannabis is happening I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think jack shit's gonna happen in the rest
of our lifetimes based on like our ages
[SPEAKER_00]: here I mean we sustainable energies when
oil is still around they're gonna lobby
[SPEAKER_00]: against that that's good but not cannabis
and we are recession proof even though the
[SPEAKER_00]: stocks are looking crazy even though some
sales are a little bit down right now I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean vice industries like it's a hard
world right now cannabis is just gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: help that so greatly appreciate the
opportunity to share some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: insights with you today and remember like
we've been around it's not like a new
[SPEAKER_00]: industry or people gonna use the internet
or buy things on the internet they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this for we've been using this for
like millions of years as a species we
[SPEAKER_00]: need industrial hemp to come back not just
novel cannabinoids like Delta 8 or CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: like rope textiles plastics and that
sector amazing as well but lacking
[SPEAKER_00]: billions of infrastructure but that's
gonna replace so much with cotton and
[SPEAKER_00]: textiles and other petroleum based
industries like this is like the one time
[SPEAKER_00]: that making good investments makes the
world better and awesome fucking returns
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do it right so really appreciate
the opportunity everyone thank you Nick
[SPEAKER_00]: Easley you you
