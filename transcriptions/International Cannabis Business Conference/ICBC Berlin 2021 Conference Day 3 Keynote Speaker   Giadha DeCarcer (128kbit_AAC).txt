[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delighted to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also delighted to see that no one is that
hungover.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually on day two, you see a lot of
sunglasses and large coffees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for being here on day two at
the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could not be more delighted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself and New Frontier Data have actually
participated in this conference quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that they're bringing it to
Europe with the caliber and sophistication
[SPEAKER_01]: that they have, it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I applaud Alex and his team.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yesterday we heard so many wonderful
speakers and they really covered such a
[SPEAKER_01]: wide array of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I particularly liked when Peter from
Denton mentioned that the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between an American and a German kicking
off a presentation is that Americans start
[SPEAKER_01]: with a joke and Germans start with an
agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not that funny and we're in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to start with a little
agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, what I really would like to
accomplish is three things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I'd like to tell you a little bit
about myself and my journey because seven
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago, almost to the date,
I was you entering a brand new industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to tell you a little bit about the
company that I founded and highlight maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: how it could help you navigate this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where data and information and
transparency is still very much required.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I want to give you a little bit
of an overview of what's happening around
[SPEAKER_01]: the globe in the cannabis industry because
today it is a global phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have over 70 nations around the world
that have legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while you may think that you only have
to be concerned with what happens in your
[SPEAKER_01]: background, in your backyard, the truth of
the matter is that it's all interconnected
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's an industry that's grown so fast
that what happens next door really does
[SPEAKER_01]: impact what you're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last but not least, I want to talk about
money because, well, yes, we absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: are in an industry where we have an
opportunity and a responsibility to do
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, as business people,
we also have an opportunity and
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me jump right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Janet DeCarcer, founder and CEO and
executive chair of New Frontier Data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned, almost a decade ago,
unbeknownst to me, I stumbled into what we
[SPEAKER_01]: referred to at the time the pot industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first announced to my colleagues
and my family that I was going into the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry, and I made sure to call
it the cannabis industry, I immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: got tagged as, hmm, here's a half Italian,
half Cuban woman that's going into the
[SPEAKER_01]: drug business.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should probably stay away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has changed tremendously,
especially when you look right now at this
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the first time, November of
2014, I attended my first conference,
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting like you are, to understand sort
of who was who and what was what in this
[SPEAKER_01]: new space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, you know, wearing my suit,
ready, you know, I'm starting a business,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I've had my hair up,
kind of like now, my glasses, my heels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enter the room, and there's literally a
cloud of smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go on stage to pitch my great idea about
data and analytics, and literally someone
[SPEAKER_01]: from the room said, can we smoke it?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can't, we don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we care now, and we care about data
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I was very pleased yesterday how
much we discussed the value and the power
[SPEAKER_01]: of information and data for this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look around the room today,
you can see how much we have evolved and
[SPEAKER_01]: how fast this industry has evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit then about new frontier
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mission, the vision has always been to
elevate the discussion around this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that has medical, recreational,
and industrial implication through
[SPEAKER_01]: fact-based reporting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There continues to be massive amounts of
misinformation in general, but specific
[SPEAKER_01]: about this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is extremely challenging to
collect good data pertinent to the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry because it is fragmented,
because it is new, because it was born of
[SPEAKER_01]: a movement, because it is still mainly
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we are trying to do is to apply a
very rigorous process in not only the data
[SPEAKER_01]: collection, but the data analysis and the
reporting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fact-based reporting, what a crazy idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're very excited to say that in the
past decade, we have been able to position
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves as a trusted source of
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't have an answer, we'll tell you
we don't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have predicted market shifts
throughout the globe at this point and
[SPEAKER_01]: over 100 nations pretty accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such, we have also earned about $17
billion in earned media.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is how many eyeballs repeatedly look
at our information on a weekly and monthly
[SPEAKER_01]: basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enough about new frontier data.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm always here if I can help,
so feel free to reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's talk a little bit about this
massive opportunity on a global scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, the global cannabis market spending
has reached over $400 billion,
[SPEAKER_01]: $415 billion to be exact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at what other industries are next to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's very interesting is that,
for instance, tobacco, fast food,
[SPEAKER_01]: and beer are all industries that are also
looking into the cannabis consumer and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that it truly has become an
industry where everyone is interested and
[SPEAKER_01]: in good touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So massive, massive mainstream mature
sectors very, very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, it's happening as we speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: A global marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you see there is what occurred very,
very recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last year, as I'm sure many of you
know, the World Health Organization and
[SPEAKER_01]: the UN declassified cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the nations that voted yes
and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is this important?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we all want to know where the next
opportunity lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all want to know what is the next
nation to legalize, whether because of
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities or challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, especially when we
look at Europe, we have just scratched the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's been really interesting,
having what I think is a front row seat
[SPEAKER_01]: that has been happening in this industry,
not only in North America, but now Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in also Africa and Latin America,
is we're beginning to see the emergence of
[SPEAKER_01]: regional centers of excellence is how I
like to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me take a step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between 2014 and 2017 in the United
States, we went from a handful of legal
[SPEAKER_01]: states to half of the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in twice that time, we're currently at
a point where it's over 35 states that
[SPEAKER_01]: have legalized, and now we're beginning to
discuss federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in half that time, over 79 nations
today have legalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happened so fast that we're beginning
to see, it's not only positioning and
[SPEAKER_01]: competition from a company to company
perspective, or even a nation to a nation
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, we're beginning to see
positioning on a regional basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me elaborate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all looking for that optimal
cultivation climate or conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Latin America and Africa do provide
optimal climates, also low labor costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is occurring?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, nations within Latin America and
Africa are trying to position themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: as those center of excellence when it
comes to cultivation and exports.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we all know that today the epicenter
of consumption continues to be the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so is Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I like to call Europe the next
frontier.
[SPEAKER_01]: European nations are beginning to legalize
but also, and I will talk about this a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more, when you look at the gap
between number of people and amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption per person, you see that the
market in Europe is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, North America and Europe are
positioning as centers of excellence when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in North America, we've seen a lot of
new technologies that have risen in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of ag tech, agriculture technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Europe, what we're seeing is some very
advanced technologies pertinent to
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction and processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, that wouldn't be so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised if many of you in the room
today are in the business of extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: and processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last but not least, Asia and Oceania.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those of you who haven't followed
some of the medical research, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia and New Zealand and other
nations around Asia Pacific have
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely sort of planted their flag in
terms of trying to advance the research
[SPEAKER_01]: and the science behind the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they continue, as well as Israel,
and they continue to try to reach out to
[SPEAKER_01]: other nations to bring in that sour fare
and advance the conversation around
[SPEAKER_01]: medical research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some trading highlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the discussion around import and export
is a little premature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because the regulation around each
nation and region is still a little
[SPEAKER_01]: nascent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nonetheless, as we all know, we have begun
to see import and export, specifically in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe, from Latin America.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the nations that currently are
in best position, let's say, to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: recipient or importers or exporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to bring attention to two in
particular that are oftentimes,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least today, left aside.
[SPEAKER_01]: India and China.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said earlier that the cannabis plant
is not only one with medical and
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational application, but also
industrial application.
Where?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, until two years ago, China was the
number one producer of hemp worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, they produced over 90% of hemp
for textile sales around the globe today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, for those of you who have
had an opportunity to visit China,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't know how many of you would
have been interested in going to the two
[SPEAKER_01]: provinces that actually do produce it,
it is a pretty sophisticated operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking drones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The automation is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So China is extremely well positioned to
corner the market and continue to corner
[SPEAKER_01]: the market from a hemp production
perspective, but they haven't quite looked
[SPEAKER_01]: into the extraction and CBD production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So India, next door, sort of, is now also
looking at potentially positioning
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves as a massive producer of CBD
biomass for extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may ask yourself, why do I care?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is China in India?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you care because in this global
market, it will have an impact on pricing
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have such massive nations producing
massive amounts of biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe, more specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the state of affairs today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see here sort of a breakdown of
adult use, medical use, with some
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In essence, the takeaway from here,
other than keep track of what's happening
[SPEAKER_01]: in Europe, is the fact that the European
market continues to be fragmented.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still trying to figure out how to
truly standardize and regulate and
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize from a regional perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more interestingly, let's talk about
what the key markets are today and where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've heard some various assessments
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, it was noted at some point
that it seems that everyone has a
[SPEAKER_01]: different number.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not untrue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we certainly begin to see some
consistency in who is on top and who are
[SPEAKER_01]: the top markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you can actually sort of take to
the bank, as I like to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, specifically, is a top market
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we predict that it will continue to be
a top market tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been discussion of whether or
not consumption in Germany and other
[SPEAKER_01]: European nations have been tapped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the truth of the matter is that when
you look at it, the illicit market alone
[SPEAKER_01]: and its opportunity to transition into the
legal market, we haven't scratched the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention the fact that there are new
consumers arising every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not consumers of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's consumers of CBD products because of
wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are in a time and era where we're
all taking better care of our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that market, as far as we're concerned,
is probably going to quadruple within the
[SPEAKER_01]: next three to four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Followed by usual suspects, Netherlands,
Italy, Poland, United Kingdom,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Netherlands again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe by numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really like this slide, and I
mentioned it earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should be no surprise that when you
look at the population of Africa and Asia,
[SPEAKER_01]: we expect those markets to be massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's really interesting is to look
at the amount spent per person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at that, that is when
North America and Europe truly shine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But specifically, Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: See the gap on the left chart between the
population and consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the right, you see the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because while Europe is already showing
sort of opportunity in terms of spending,
[SPEAKER_01]: the number of countries that haven't yet
legalized is truly massive, thus raising,
[SPEAKER_01]: rising, raising that ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we bring you back to Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're seeing here is a delta
between the illicit consumption and the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we can all read graphs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we see?
[SPEAKER_01]: We see the convergence of those two lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that as Germany has legalized,
we have seen a very effective,
[SPEAKER_01]: if not optimal, transition from the
illicit market to the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those two lines will soon cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last but not least, money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Favorite topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned earlier that in almost the
last decade, it's been quite the journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis industry has truly evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have personally felt the evolution of
the money conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as many of you, I've been raising
money since 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, between 2014 and 2015, I raised my
first $1 to $2 million, almost $50,000 at
[SPEAKER_01]: a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because between 2014 and 2016,
2017, the truth of the matter is the size
[SPEAKER_01]: of the checks and the types of investors
that entered this space were primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: angel investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So small checks, many, many transactions,
small checks, what we refer to as the
[SPEAKER_01]: green rush, which was primarily in the
United States and North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fast forward three years, we began to see
venture capital funds, institutional
[SPEAKER_01]: money, family offices, who began to
finally write million dollar checks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're in what I called Cannabis
Investment 3.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fewer transactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly fewer transactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the size of those transactions are
becoming quite impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, here are a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're beginning to see billion dollar
valuations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're beginning to see companies going
public in a mature and material manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're beginning to see also
investments from very large multinationals
[SPEAKER_01]: across mature sectors that have paid
attention and now see a massive
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I leave you with a few questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, what we do on New
Frontier Data is we try to guess what's
[SPEAKER_01]: next.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Predict what's next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can constantly challenge ourselves
with questions that no one else is
[SPEAKER_01]: answering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are some of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also just published a report.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I encourage you to look for it online.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an entire global trends report that
specifically looks at THC, adult use,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the opportunity it may provide on a
global scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, I'm happy to take some
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it for Giada Decar,
sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have time for a question or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone have any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: No?
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are the least inquisitive
conference crowd.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not inquisitive, but I'm saying,
don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no dumb questions, only dumb
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kidding, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick question.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I'm trying to get or navigate
through the information all across
[SPEAKER_02]: different sources, I've struggled the most
to find information about consumers and
[SPEAKER_02]: about drivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What drives them to consume the products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did someone plant you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did someone plant you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if my team did, well done.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to finalize that question is
whatever I found seems to be very polite
[SPEAKER_02]: answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think they are real answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And probably that is due to many factors,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But what would be your advice into getting
some sort of consumer insights?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've presented me the perfect
opportunity to plug new frontier data
[SPEAKER_01]: again, and I am going to shamelessly take
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first and foremost, for those of you
who don't know, the cannabis consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: segment is the newest segment that we have
seen in the past 20 years, meaning
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer packaged goods and brands have
understood consumer behavior for many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many years, and they're very comfortable
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here comes a brand new consumer group
with a completely unique behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly unique behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been tracking this behavior for
almost a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have, and today we actually have
information and data on over 167 million
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis consumers, which, by the way,
represents about 85% to 90% of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers across North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are very interested in the cannabis
consumer and their behavior and how to
[SPEAKER_01]: engage with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your question is how do you navigate
and better understand them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I will give you my card after this
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the types of questions that we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've sort of alluded to it earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of non-cannabis brands
entering this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you some examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying these are the companies
because there's confidentiality behind it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the likes of Lamborghini, McDonald's,
Papa John's, the Body Shop, Nestle,
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnson & Johnson, L'Oreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do all these companies want to
understand?
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to understand how can they
monetize and take advantage of this new
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis consumer group that is not only
consuming cannabis products, but is also
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming other products, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you smoke and you get the munchies,
you may want to go to McDonald's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they want to know where you are and
how they can get to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The types of questions that we get are who
are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they behave?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do they go?
[SPEAKER_01]: And believe it or not, today we have a lot
of visibility into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if I answered your
question, but I can certainly answer it in
[SPEAKER_01]: more detail offline.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you guys aggregate your data?
[SPEAKER_01]: Magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Magic, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I figure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's usually what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alchemy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crystal balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: That works too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually a very, very painful
process, and it was even more painful
[SPEAKER_01]: almost a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily because, as you can imagine,
the industry, as I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry was born of a movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were a lot of cultivators in
California that were basically cultivating
[SPEAKER_01]: illegally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a bunch of money on the ground in
big oil barrels.
[SPEAKER_01]: True story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their idea of inventory management was
a yellow pad and pencil so that it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: erased or shredded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So collecting information early on was
extremely challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, while we now have point-of-sale
solutions and we have online nexuses or
[SPEAKER_01]: loyalty programs and all kinds of other
technologies that allow us access to
[SPEAKER_01]: electronic stream of information,
those allowing us better sourcing of
[SPEAKER_01]: information, there's still a lot of
volatility, if not lack of consistency
[SPEAKER_01]: across systems, as well as frameworks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, yesterday we heard a little
bit from Metric and others about the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's still fragmented from a
regulatory perspective and the types of
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies that we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the short answer is we hook up to
a lot of other systems, including doing
[SPEAKER_01]: things online and grabbing information
from local, state, national, and regional
[SPEAKER_01]: government bodies to the extent that we
can get that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we license and buy information
from a lot of point-of-sale solutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: loyalty programs, and others.
[SPEAKER_01]: We aggregate it and normalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last three years, what surprised
you the most as you've looked through this
[SPEAKER_00]: data?
[SPEAKER_00]: What weren't you expecting to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow-up to that, moving
forward, looking into the next three
[SPEAKER_00]: years, what do you see as being the
biggest uncertainties that people haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: thought about yet or that would surprise
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest surprise is that I'm still
standing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been quite the journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened at the UN level recently to
me was somewhat surprising, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: given the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't have predicted COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may have very well been a
catalyst to that movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew that it was a global arena.
[SPEAKER_01]: We knew that we were going to see
legalization beyond North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't quite foresee that the World
Health Organization and United Nations
[SPEAKER_01]: were going to make such statements at that
point of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was certainly surprising to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of surprises in the future,
and maybe it's because I have a background
[SPEAKER_01]: in international relations, I'm very
curious to see what happens with China and
[SPEAKER_01]: India.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just big numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm in the business of numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: If those two markets activate and flood
the industry, it could have some pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: serious impact, good or bad, depending on
where you stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it certainly would change how the
industry is evolving, as well as pricing
[SPEAKER_01]: and other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
