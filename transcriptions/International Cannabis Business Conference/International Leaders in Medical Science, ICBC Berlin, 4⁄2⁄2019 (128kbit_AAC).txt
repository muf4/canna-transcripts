[SPEAKER_01]: From Strain Print, the president and CTO,
let's hear it for Dave Berg!
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, thanks for the nice intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to break tradition from the
other formatted discussions that or panels
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've seen here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a very diverse panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're studying advancements in medical
science from the perspective of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid medicine and we have a very
diverse group here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to give everyone the ability
to introduce themselves with the support
[SPEAKER_01]: of some slides and to give them the
ability to fill in the blanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interestingly, I'm the only one up here
that does not have an MD or a PhD,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I come to you with some interesting
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of years ago my partners and I
were onboarding into the Canadian Medical
[SPEAKER_01]: Program and trying to find a way to get
more information about the appropriate
[SPEAKER_01]: products we should be using, how we should
be dosing, and what we can expect from the
[SPEAKER_01]: outcome of our treatments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that we looked at literary
reviews, we spoke to our doctors,
[SPEAKER_01]: we spoke to clinics and other caregivers,
and there was no data available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we set forth to build that data set and
we've done that in Canada and North
[SPEAKER_01]: America and we're actually here having
great discussions with a number of people
[SPEAKER_01]: in the German and Swiss market about ways
we can apply our approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we predominantly do is we've
developed a mobile app that allows
[SPEAKER_01]: patients in Canada to track their
interaction with lab-verified products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do this across 350 different medical
conditions and we analyze their response
[SPEAKER_01]: to Canadian registered products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has given us a preview of a lot of
consumer and patient behavior and
[SPEAKER_01]: observational use over a two-year period
of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quite enlightening and especially
for the medical audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of our data is crowd-sourced,
it's gathered from patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a community where we support
patients for discussions that are hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: have on Facebook and that rolls up into an
analytics platform and the data that we
[SPEAKER_01]: collect from this platform is used by
retail pharmacies across Canada to provide
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribing guidance when a patient calls
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's based on the large cohort data
that we produce in the app.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been fairly successful in our
mission so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gathered over 1.2 million patient
interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is on a platform that's HIPAA,
PIPEDA and FIPPA compliant and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the largest medicinal
observational data set in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we do is we provide this tool to
physicians, to researchers and clinicians
[SPEAKER_01]: to help them to identify what is working
and what is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a background of how I
arrive at this table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a different view of medical
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based on statistical and correlatory
analysis and what I'd like to do is give
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone else the ability to introduce
themselves in a similar fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order of the slides, I'd first like
to introduce Dr. Franjo Grotenherman who
[SPEAKER_01]: is very well known amongst this crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the executive director of the
International Association for Cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicines, IACM in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is also the chairman of the Association
for Cannabis as a Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Germany and he is also a medical
practitioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me hand it over to Franjo to
introduce himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have only two slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know the legal
situation in Germany exactly and I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to introduce it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a slide on the prerequisites for
reimbursement for cannabis medicines by
[SPEAKER_00]: German health insurers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is also kind of a guideline for
German physicians in which conditions they
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are three prerequisites.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, the patients have to suffer from a
severe disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's discussion between the
physician and the health insurer if this
[SPEAKER_00]: is severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the health insurer may argue,
well, he's able to work so the disease is
[SPEAKER_00]: not so severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second prerequisite is that a
generally recognized medical standard
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment is either not available or
cannot be applied on the reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment of the treating physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third, which is very interesting
or important, when it comes to research or
[SPEAKER_00]: the available data is that there is a
founded chance or kind of justified chance
[SPEAKER_00]: of a noticeable positive effect on the
cause of the disease or on serious
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the latter requirement is fulfilled if
there is scientific research supporting
[SPEAKER_00]: this chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not necessary that there is that
there are large clinical studies with 200
[SPEAKER_00]: or 300 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be sufficient that there is,
for example, for Tourette's syndrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have only very small studies,
10, 20 people, but Tourette's syndrome is
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be interesting to have
research with 20 or 30 people,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 or 30 patients in diseases where we
have nearly nothing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you some examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you some diseases which are
promising but currently under-researched.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number of people suffering in
Germany with this disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we have about two million
people with ADHD above the age of 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: The current guidelines for treatment of
ADHD in Germany say don't use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They explicitly say that you should not
use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some more data to show it is
effective, at least in some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autism, we have no real good medication to
treat autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: No good standard medication to treat this
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis often is helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have about a half million people in
Germany suffering from autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is absolutely no clinical
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: For ADHD, we have at least one clinical
study conducted with the Cannabis District
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativex in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with autism, we have nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have good anti-depressant medications,
but one third or 30% of patients do not
[SPEAKER_00]: profit from standard medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have 3.5 million patients with
depression, there would be about one
[SPEAKER_00]: million depressed patients who do not get
sufficient relief by standard medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no research.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some research on reactive
depression in cancer, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: but with neurotic depression or major
depression, we have nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post-traumatic stress disorder,
we have some research on it, but we should
[SPEAKER_00]: have more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obsessive-compulsive disorder,
we have nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a few case reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, from the Charit√© in Berlin
here, 1.4 million people suffering from
[SPEAKER_00]: obsessive-compulsive disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not always severe cases,
but as in any case, any disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have light, moderate, and severe
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychiatric conditions are usually
under-researched when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has tradition because psychiatrists
often are very reluctant when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to do research in this area of
psychotic conditions because the patients
[SPEAKER_00]: are suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of them do not get enough relief from
standard medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the companies, this is also a
market, if you say it in other words.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the patients, it's a need.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the company, it's a market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for researchers, it is a must-do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have many physical conditions where we
do not have much on our research.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I see patients with acne
inversa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's under-researched and unknown disease,
suffering more than half a million people
[SPEAKER_00]: in Germany alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have no good medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are usually unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are undergoing surgery once a year or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cluster headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something with migraine,
but we have nothing with cluster headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hyperhidrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have several people with hyperdosis,
severe hyperdosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are three grades, from light,
moderate, to severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have patients who have undergone
surgery to treat the hyperdosis of the
[SPEAKER_00]: arms and the hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis, at least in some people,
works well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not have clinical research,
so we don't know the percentage of people
[SPEAKER_00]: who may profit from a treatment of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can say, at least some people
profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome,
tinnitus.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to research, I will give an
example with another under-researched
[SPEAKER_00]: condition, which is restless leg syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: With restless leg syndrome, you also see
that it is not only about THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is maybe true for other
indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it may be reasonable, for example,
to have a three-arm research.
[SPEAKER_00]: One-arm placebo, one-arm anindica strain,
one-arm a sativa strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or one-arm CBD THC strain and one THC
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example is the following.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four weeks ago, I had a patient with
restless leg syndrome, treatment resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: to standard medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: She went to the Netherlands to try
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some months later, she had an appointment
in my practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told her, well, in restless leg
syndrome, I usually prescribe indica
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were not available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the problems with getting enough
cannabis to Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I prescribed a sativa strain to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And three days later, she was very
disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, it does not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meanwhile, indica strains were
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prescribed an indica strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some days later, she said,
I have the same effect as with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could sleep like a baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Dr. Tim Shue.
[SPEAKER_05]: My background is veterinarian.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Prior to starting my company, VetCBD,
I practiced in general emergency and
[SPEAKER_05]: critical care medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why I found a VetCBD in
2015 was because as a health care
[SPEAKER_05]: practitioner, I believe we have a moral
and ethical obligation to pursue all
[SPEAKER_05]: potential courses of therapy for our
patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my approach is that if cannabis has
potential therapeutic benefits,
[SPEAKER_05]: then we owe it to our patients and the pet
owners to be able to pursue those
[SPEAKER_05]: therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if cannabis doesn't have any sort
of therapeutic benefits, we need to find
[SPEAKER_05]: that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make that information available
to pet owners so they can make the best
[SPEAKER_05]: decisions for their pets.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reality is that for animals,
the lifespan is a lot shorter.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of patients don't have time to wait.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's now or never.
[SPEAKER_05]: So from the time that we bring them home
when they're puppies, in the blink of an
[SPEAKER_05]: eye, lifetime's passed by.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we know it, we're saying our
goodbyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in 2015, I retired from practice
and started VetCBD so that way we could
[SPEAKER_05]: provide cannabinoid therapeutics for
animals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the things that we've used it for for
the past four years for thousands and
[SPEAKER_05]: thousands of patients across California
are primarily things like pain,
[SPEAKER_05]: anxiety, inflammation, nausea,
seizures, and cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of people may be familiar with
using cannabis or CBD for dogs,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we also use it for cats.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use it for horses, guinea pigs,
rabbits, rats, pigs, ferrets.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you name it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reality is that all vertebrae animals
have endocannabinoid systems and they do
[SPEAKER_05]: stand to benefit from cannabis
therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people talk about THC and they
don't know about the use for THC in
[SPEAKER_05]: animals, but we do use THC in animals.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do use full spectrum products that
include THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also look at CBC, CBG.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, when we approach cannabinoid
therapeutics, the reality is that the
[SPEAKER_05]: endocannabinoid system was only discovered
in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so as a field of medicine,
we're really just scratching the surface.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ultimately my goal is to be able to
integrate cannabinoid therapeutics with
[SPEAKER_05]: veterinary medicine so that way we can
benefit our patients, we can provide them
[SPEAKER_05]: quality of life, and we can provide
sustained value to those pet owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a senior scientist from Vulcanic
Center Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a head of a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Vulcanic, which is a governmental
research institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my lab, we are focused on cannabis
studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are involved with the process that
Israel is going now of this reform of
[SPEAKER_02]: medicalization where with other national
bodies, like the Israeli GenBank,
[SPEAKER_02]: we form genetics, collection of seeds of
genetics that is the national collection
[SPEAKER_02]: of Israel and will serve growers and
scientists for the further developments of
[SPEAKER_02]: this field.
[SPEAKER_02]: We characterize this collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the main activity in my lab is I
think what might be the major challenge
[SPEAKER_02]: that we face in this field of cannabis for
medical use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the generation of
evidence-based medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what we are focused on.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my lab, we ask what are the best
mixtures of active cannabis compounds for
[SPEAKER_02]: optimized treatment for different medical
indications or conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: To answer this particular question,
we have a very small farm for research
[SPEAKER_02]: purposes only.
[SPEAKER_02]: We develop different extraction protocols
or use different extraction protocols.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do deep chemical analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see far and beyond THC versus CBD,
but rather we look at many different
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, terapans, flavonoids,
whatever there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do separation of the compounds and then
examine in different bioessays that
[SPEAKER_02]: reflect, at least to some extent,
different medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are able to identify the compounds and
the compositions and the entourage effect
[SPEAKER_02]: that we heard about these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are able to identify these compounds
that act together for optimized treatment
[SPEAKER_02]: of patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work with physicians from hospitals in
Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the information that we find in our
studies is being now developed by
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial companies to products that are
going into clinical trials in hospitals in
[SPEAKER_02]: Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just briefly, let me take you as to the
future, at least as the way that we see it
[SPEAKER_02]: in cannabis for medical use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we all start from weeds and sativa and
indica that we heard about quite a lot and
[SPEAKER_02]: from different strains or cultivars that
we heard about.
[SPEAKER_02]: By conducting bioessays, we identify
synergies between cannabis molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: These synergies, of course, also by
chemical analysis, leads to formulation of
[SPEAKER_02]: active pharmaceutical ingredients or
active plant ingredients, all derived from
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are able to determine what the
formulation of active compounds is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look for targets and mode of action of
these specific synergistic API.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then by a process of development being
done by our commercial collaborators that
[SPEAKER_02]: include different steps of regulation and
development of drug delivery, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: also highly important.
[SPEAKER_02]: By that, we are able to promote and to
bring, we believe, new generation of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis-based products for medical use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those that will be based on API,
on synergies, and will be standardized for
[SPEAKER_02]: optimal and specific use for patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to steal her mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had a lot of discussion about the
ways that cannabis can be used to treat
[SPEAKER_01]: things like IBS, Crohn's disease,
depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard about its use in animal and
veterinary care, and we've talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: isolating cannabinoids and terpenes into
formulations that more closely approximate
[SPEAKER_01]: a molecular drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that I think is
necessary as the industry moves forward
[SPEAKER_01]: and as cannabis develops into a medicine
is to understand those interactions and
[SPEAKER_01]: the entourage effect, because it's the
seclusion or preclusion of certain
[SPEAKER_01]: elements within a strain that actually
will dictate the way that it interacts
[SPEAKER_01]: with the human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Franjo had mentioned, there's very
big differences between the people will
[SPEAKER_01]: respond from strain to strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the Israeli approach,
we're looking at isolating and
[SPEAKER_01]: reconstituting product for test within
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order for doctors to be comfortable
with it, this is at least something that
[SPEAKER_01]: we see in the Canadian medical program is
that you need to be able to talk the
[SPEAKER_01]: language or the rubric or lexicon that the
doctor is used to prescribing against.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because this is an evidence-based
study, a lot of physicians these days,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least from what we see at StrainPrint,
are reticent to prescribe because they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have the data of that molecular
drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a gap that we see in terms of
their understanding of the application of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids for various therapies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I can ask Franjo, what are some
of the gaps that you see in terms of our
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge for treatment in patient use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me say one word on the history
of modern cannabis research which started
[SPEAKER_00]: with clinical studies the first was
conducted in 1975.
[SPEAKER_00]: All clinical studies on the medical use of
cannabis in different diseases has been
[SPEAKER_00]: initiated by patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients went to their doctors at a
university and if they were lucky,
[SPEAKER_00]: this doctor found it very interesting,
this experience, and he asked other
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, if they had similar experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give the example of Tourette
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Studies on Tourette syndrome have been
conducted at the medical school of ANOFA
[SPEAKER_00]: because there we have a professor,
Dr. Kirsten M√ºller-Waal, who was told by
[SPEAKER_00]: their patients in the 1990s, if we take
cannabis, we have relief of our symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he made the first study with one
patient, a second study with 10 patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: one day studies, then a study with a few
patients over time of four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could have happened also to patients
with other diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important that hospital doctors or
doctors listen to their patients and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: say, this is not possible, we have no
clinical data, we have to gain clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first patient with hyperhidrosis who
used cannabis and was successful,
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before, I did not know that cannabis may
work in hyperhidrosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I wrote a very short piece in a hemp
journal, Journal of Hemp Journal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got feedback from other patients
that I am also suffering from
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperhidrosis, I am profiting from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we need is doctors at large
hospitals, at universities, who listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: their patients, who tell them incredible
stories about what cannabis can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to start research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, research is rather
expensive, so if there is an interested
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor at a university, he will usually
only be able to do an open study with 10
[SPEAKER_00]: or 20 people, and he will not be able to
carry out large studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is necessary that companies and
the scientists at university come together
[SPEAKER_00]: to look, what can we do to profit the
patient, the doctor, the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess as a follow-on, I'd like to ask
the same thing of Tim.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see that a lot of people, in terms of
prescribing for their pets, they really do
[SPEAKER_01]: think of them as extensions of the family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hear stories of people putting their
dogs on Prozac or on cardiovascular heart
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs to extend their life, also dealing
with pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen applications for PTSD,
depression, anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of things are you seeing in
terms of veterinary medicine and the
[SPEAKER_01]: approaches that you're taking using
cannabinoid therapy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think some of the things that are
uniquely challenging when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_05]: medical aspect of cannabis is that it's
very backwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times when we're looking at other
therapeutics, other drugs, we tend to have
[SPEAKER_05]: these clinical trials that are
established, and then what happens is the
[SPEAKER_05]: patients benefit afterwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: But cannabis coming from a black market,
essentially what happens is now the market
[SPEAKER_05]: becomes the driving force and the science
and the medicine take a back seat and have
[SPEAKER_05]: to play catch up because the market will
operate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether it's a black, gray, or legal
market, the market will always be there
[SPEAKER_05]: and it will continue to operate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the reality is when the market is
black or gray, the scientific and the
[SPEAKER_05]: medical aspect of it are going to be
unable to operate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we see is that we see in terms
of the real world evidence, we see a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of patients using it for all sorts of
different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see a lot of case studies that have
been successful.
[SPEAKER_05]: For things like pain, anxiety,
inflammation, whether it's allergies or
[SPEAKER_05]: autoimmune diseases, nausea, seizures,
and cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're seeing a lack of complete
clinical trials and clinical evidence
[SPEAKER_05]: because of the market that we have to
operate in.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really, really unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And veterinarians, especially in America,
are in a unique position because across
[SPEAKER_05]: America, veterinarians are actually not
allowed to discuss cannabis with their
[SPEAKER_05]: clients.
[SPEAKER_05]: So something that's potentially beneficial
or even lifesaving for their clients,
[SPEAKER_05]: they can't even discuss that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now California has changed a little bit
because last year we helped get a bill
[SPEAKER_05]: passed called AB 2215 that allows for
California veterinarians to discuss
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis with their clients.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first bill of its kind in the country
and hopefully it leads the way for people
[SPEAKER_05]: to be able to discuss this with their
veterinarians because if they're not
[SPEAKER_05]: hearing it from their veterinarians,
they're a primary source of medical
[SPEAKER_05]: information.
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens is they're going to go on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're gonna Google these symptoms and
find out what it may or may not do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of times this information could
be false or inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're asking friends or family when they
really should be talking to medical
[SPEAKER_05]: professionals about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, when it comes to the
endocannabinoid system and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: therapeutics in general, the medical
teachings are far behind.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when I talk to a lot of veterinarians,
they don't know about the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: system.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know about endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can just imagine if you went to
your doctor, you went to your
[SPEAKER_05]: veterinarian, you asked them about the
endocrine system.
[SPEAKER_05]: You asked them about what insulin does for
your body.
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens if you have low levels of
testosterone or estrogen and they threw up
[SPEAKER_05]: their hands and said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you feel as a patient?
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you feel if that's what your
medical professional said?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the reality of what we're
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times these veterinarians or
physicians, they say, I don't know because
[SPEAKER_05]: they're not being taught this material in
school and this information isn't being
[SPEAKER_05]: made available to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, partially because of the legal
blockades that are involved here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is the problem that we're
seeing is a lack of education and this is
[SPEAKER_05]: one of the things that we're focused on is
educating veterinarians and veterinary
[SPEAKER_05]: clients to be able to have this education
so that they can make informed decisions
[SPEAKER_05]: about their healthcare.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we're looking at is
building custom solutions for custom
[SPEAKER_01]: disease states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at isolating compounds so
that we can deliver next generation proper
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something that Hananit is
doing in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you can tell us about what you
think are some of the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities for development and
exploration based on your view of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like just first to say a few words
about the issue of education.
Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm involved with in Israel in
the frame of the Ministry of Health is
[SPEAKER_02]: teaching medical personnel, physicians,
nurses, pharmacists about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so interesting to see how
stigmatized this subject is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevertheless, the stigma is being slowly
being reduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, and I completely conferred to
what you said, but this is a matter of
[SPEAKER_02]: education of really educating the
personnel, the medical personnel on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and on the different properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely agree with- That's
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking the same line, answering your
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I think the main importance here is
to close the gap that we have today
[SPEAKER_02]: between the current knowledge of what we
know about cannabis on the different
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds, on the entourage effect,
and the actual compounds that are working
[SPEAKER_02]: together or separately for different
medical indications.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, from my experience at least,
that many of the physicians, the doctors
[SPEAKER_02]: are having a real problem to recommend a
patient to smoke a joint to get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they do not see that as a treatment,
as a medicine, and this is, I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not just in Israel, but- I think North
America shares a similar view towards
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking and as a non-medical form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most physicians that I talk to would
prefer that people use an oil or use an
[SPEAKER_01]: edible or vaporize using a device because
obviously it's not good to combust and you
[SPEAKER_01]: get all the other bad chemicals in along
with the good chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not just that, this is not a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here, first of all, specifying what
compounds are the active ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so important, definitely for
treatment and also for the physicians,
[SPEAKER_02]: for the medical personnel to accept
cannabis as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then two is the delivery, the method
of delivery, which should be much
[SPEAKER_02]: improved, no doubt, from smoking to actual
products that have certain formulation,
[SPEAKER_02]: high bioavailability, high absorption,
absorbance, dosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: These should be dosed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that is needed when
we're looking at this as a medicine is the
[SPEAKER_01]: concept of transparency and
standardization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you are going to take it from a
dried flower and you're going to render it
[SPEAKER_01]: down into isolates that are reconstituted
or formulated, you need to deliver an
[SPEAKER_01]: experience that is going to be the same
every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it's going to take for it
to be well understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're seeing in studies from ones
like in Israel that Dedimiri had done on
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer cells where he looked at 600 cancer
cells and subjected them to 600 different
[SPEAKER_01]: strains of cannabis to identify one that
stopped the tumor growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're going to have to do trial and
error testing like that, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately prohibitive and time
constraining.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of what we need to do to get our
knowledge up to par is done through
[SPEAKER_01]: observational science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like it or not, this is not a drug
that's come into power through clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been brought in by government and
constitutional rights around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps I can turn it back to Dr.
Franjo to ask you about what your
[SPEAKER_01]: experience is in the German market and
what changes that you've seen in your
[SPEAKER_01]: practice over the years that you've been
involved in prescribing.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I understand, you look at a number of
advanced cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all were surprised that the number of
patients are increasing so quickly in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is clear that usually one or two
percent of the population in
[SPEAKER_00]: industrialized countries need cannabis as
a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that from Canada, Israel,
and the Netherlands that it will be one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two percent also in US states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was aware that this will also come
to Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we expect to have 800,000 or 1.6
million patients in Germany in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently we have about 40,000 patients
and it is increasing very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doctors, politicians are just currently
realizing that cannabis as a medicine is
[SPEAKER_00]: not an exception compared to standard
medication, but that it is really an
[SPEAKER_00]: important medical treatment, a good
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number of doctors are also
increasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it from other countries that first
there are very few physicians who are
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's happening in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few physicians and the
development is quicker than we thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: that physicians are ready to do it,
even against the obstacles by the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so easy to prescribe cannabis in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physicians do it anywhere for their
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number of patients are increasing
quickly and the number of doctors also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course there is much uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is described here as a chance that
cannabis is so diverse and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains and batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a beginner this is a confusion and it
makes it not easier, but more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the reason why many physicians in
Germany start with dronabinol,
[SPEAKER_00]: only THC or with standardized extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have to do is to give them
education so that they regard the
[SPEAKER_00]: different potions, the different
possibilities of cannabis treatment as a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance and not as a threat or as a
confusing issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about indica sativa or CBD THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients want to find their strain which
works best and they want to have it
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized that they get all of the same
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And physicians have to understand that
cannabis is more than THC and regard this
[SPEAKER_00]: as a chance to find a better treatment for
their doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need education, we need
standardization, and we need clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Tim, with standardization, research,
what are you seeing in terms of veterinary
[SPEAKER_01]: science?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there standardization?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing pet foods, we're seeing hemp
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of products are being frequented
by pet owners in California and for what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so like I said before, you know,
primarily what we see is tinctures,
[SPEAKER_05]: oral-based medications.
[SPEAKER_05]: We definitely do not have pets smoking or
vaporizing, so I just want to make sure
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone's aware that I get that question
all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't have your pet smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do not hot box your dog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's coming from a veterinarian.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we use it for pain, anxiety,
inflammation, nausea, seizures,
[SPEAKER_05]: and cancer, like I said before.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the unique thing about cannabis is
that it's an incredibly complex plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's over 500 pharmaceutical components
of the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: The endocannabinoid system is infinitely
complex.
[SPEAKER_05]: The CB1 receptors, we used to think that
they were only in the central nervous
[SPEAKER_05]: system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we know that they're found all
throughout the body.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with the CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even when we're looking at the
cannabinoid receptors, in human studies,
[SPEAKER_05]: they've shown to have genetic
polymorphisms.
[SPEAKER_05]: What that means is that your CB1 receptors
may not be encoded as the same as the
[SPEAKER_05]: person sitting next to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So cannabis, the way it works on your
body, may not be the way that it works on
[SPEAKER_05]: your neighbor's body.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we think that that may be the case
in animals also, because we do see
[SPEAKER_05]: variations in dosing protocols.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we could have a 70-pound dog that uses
it for epilepsy that uses a higher dose
[SPEAKER_05]: than another one that uses a much lower
dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one may need it three times a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other may be able to use it just one
time a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's some of the difficulties that
we're encountering is that it's hard to
[SPEAKER_05]: standardize dose for each individual
patient when we know that there can be so
[SPEAKER_05]: much differentiation.
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD, the molecule, works on over 40
different molecular targets.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a very weak affinity for the CB1
and CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is something that it shows you
just how complex it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're trying to get a clearer picture
of it, but it's going to take time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the meantime, the mantra of
starting low and then gradually titrating
[SPEAKER_05]: up to the effective ophthalmotherapeutic
dose is good advice, not just for people,
[SPEAKER_05]: but also for animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good advice in any time using
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start low, go slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that we've just been
asked is to open up the floor to
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it again for the panel,
first of all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very informative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Thomas Garling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question to Frans.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when your claim is, or when you say,
well, OK, there must be more doctors to
[SPEAKER_03]: support this and need to be educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I saw a video or a report on German
TV where the CEO of the Adstecoma has been
[SPEAKER_03]: strongly very controversial and against
supporting cannabis, maybe you can tell
[SPEAKER_03]: me, how is the strategy to really break
out of the wall?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this is a lot of effort without
maybe just a little effect today with a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of effort on your side.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we see today is that every
doctor is somehow finding his own way to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat their patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, a colleague in the board of
directors of the ISM and the ICM is also a
[SPEAKER_00]: German doctor at a university.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we recently talked together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And found out that we have the same idea
of the usefulness of cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have different approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was the reason why we decided to
have a panel of doctors at our next ICM
[SPEAKER_00]: conference, which will also be in Berlin,
where doctors tell the audience what is
[SPEAKER_00]: their approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need education.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have to realize that it is
possible to get different approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physicians are used to give single
molecules, for example, THG, or a
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized extract, such as Sativex.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, from the Adstecoma,
they are more supporting these efforts and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes are saying that cannabis flowers
is a kind of middle age medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the flowers may be regarded as a
threat to usual therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to change it, that it is a
chance to a better treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody is asking me, a doctor in
Germany, how can I start the treatment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I usually say, you may start with THC
or standardized extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have more experience,
then you can change to a cannabis flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps to get more effects than with THC,
perhaps lesser side effects or better
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need education.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every doctor also have to make his
career, his experience, his own education
[SPEAKER_00]: with the interaction of his patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this makes cannabis somewhat special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because other medicines, you bring it to
the market and you say you start with five
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams, then go to 10 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis, it's not always the same
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am sure that I have different ways than
many other doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we try to bring to
doctors, that there is no one golden way
[SPEAKER_00]: to treat patients with cannabis-based
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have time for one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'm Greg from the UK Cannabis Social
Club.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that leads me perfectly into my
question, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a one-size-fits-all medical
cannabis product available in the UK
[SPEAKER_04]: called Sativex.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's labeled as having X amount of THC and
X amount of CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we all know that it's a full plant
extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got all the flavonoids and terpenes
in there as well, and esters.
[SPEAKER_04]: So isn't it a little bit insincere that
we're talking about and creating these
[SPEAKER_04]: medicines with just THC and CBD in it when
they do have all these other drug
[SPEAKER_04]: interactions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if I take two strains,
similar to GW have for Sativex,
[SPEAKER_04]: and say, well, this one produces an almost
pure THC extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one produces an almost pure CBD
extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to mix them together to get the
ratio I need.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm going to give it to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: If a guy takes two strains he's got over
in San Francisco, I only need two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got to keep it easy on this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take two strains you've got over
there that make that high THC and high
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD, you're still going to get a different
reaction from the strains that I'm going
[SPEAKER_04]: to make that from my home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet when we're talking to government
ministers and politicians and journalists,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're very confused by this because
they're like, well, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pharmaceutical company is this is just
THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it leaves people like me, activists,
patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been denied a prescription in the UK
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: It leaves us in a really bad situation
because people want to follow the science
[SPEAKER_04]: and who seems to be the most educated on
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're actually we've got a lot more
experience in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got six strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know work for my condition, the
different symptoms that I need to function
[SPEAKER_04]: on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't be turned around and told,
no, you can't grow your own.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have one of these
available from one of these companies and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to suck it up and deal with
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not really working for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're pushing for the right to grow at
home.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to know, where do you
think that actually fits in in this
[SPEAKER_04]: interim period before we've actually got
any of these products we're all talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about?
[SPEAKER_04]: One day making for people like me,
should we decriminalize for people to be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to grow in Europe as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you touch here a very important
point of the somewhat superficial view
[SPEAKER_02]: that most have on on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm including pharmaceutical companies
talking on on THC and CBD in an extract is
[SPEAKER_02]: superficial view.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have so many other compounds,
molecules in these extracts and they're so
[SPEAKER_02]: important and may change so much the
outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to share with you briefly just
one of the observations that we had in our
[SPEAKER_02]: studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work on the IBD, inflammatory bowel
diseases, and we examine in our systems in
[SPEAKER_02]: collaboration with mayor hospital in
Israel, we examine the effect of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts, fractions and compounds on
alleviation of colon inflammation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see that that it's it's you can you can
imagine the extract like like like a pile
[SPEAKER_02]: of Lego building blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see that when we choose some of the
building blocks and put them together,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can get efficacy, which is 20 times
higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pay by taking the right building
blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so this is just one example to the
point that you touched that we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: know so much more on cannabis and need to
know to choose better the compounds,
[SPEAKER_02]: let them work together to get much better
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can I think that you can imagine
that different diseases should be treated
[SPEAKER_02]: very, very much specifically by different
combinations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to cut you off, but we're
completely out of time, but you're
[SPEAKER_05]: correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it again for the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
