[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Ali Jamalian, I'm the founder
of San San Francisco is number one
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturing and distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also cultivate flowers and have been in
this business for about 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was arrested by the federal government
in 99 which then positioned me now to be
[SPEAKER_03]: the social equity commissioner in San
Francisco which allowed us to pull
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses for those who had been
disadvantaged by the poor on drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might know some of our strengths like
Lamb's Breath, Sunset Sherbert,
[SPEAKER_03]: those are some of the strains that we are
behind so that earned me the honor to be
[SPEAKER_03]: here today and to moderate the panel with
a group of very very knowledgeable growers
[SPEAKER_03]: and cannabis folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that being said I'd like to start the
panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one question that we'd like to use
as an icebreaker which is where the panel
[SPEAKER_03]: sees international cannabis going in the
next few years and with that I'll pass it
[SPEAKER_03]: to Travis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much Ali.
[SPEAKER_05]: International cannabis as you've all heard
throughout this time here is really headed
[SPEAKER_05]: to where can we learn from the places that
have already done this right and I think
[SPEAKER_05]: it's very interesting to equate it to a
match.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every single state that we've looked at in
the past is a match that takes a while to
[SPEAKER_05]: get started but once it does it burns
really really bright for a period of time
[SPEAKER_05]: let's call it three years and every single
person who gets into it frankly is gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: make money for a period of time and then
it's going to burn and simmer down and
[SPEAKER_05]: those who came into it from with the right
headspace and really doubled down and
[SPEAKER_05]: really focused on systems and process
right from an optimizing cultivation those
[SPEAKER_05]: are the ones who in the long term are
going to make it past the ember and we've
[SPEAKER_05]: seen this in every single state where they
burn right and they kind of dissipate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones who make it all the way the end
will be the ones that are around for a
[SPEAKER_05]: lifetime so that's my point of view.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks Travis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think to add to that the international
scene is not unified yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't really have legislation that is
overarching where Germany can do easily
[SPEAKER_03]: business with the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: For us coming from the US side of things
exporting California or Colorado buds to
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany is very very far away on our
legislative map if I would say what like
[SPEAKER_03]: five to ten years maybe something like
that so I think it kind of depends what
[SPEAKER_03]: countries do individual trade deals with
each other and that will then kind of lead
[SPEAKER_03]: to an international umbrella of companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone else want to add to that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I think you're going to have to start
looking at how you want to play in this
[SPEAKER_04]: market so if you're going to be somebody
that's going to be a large grower and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to make a single product that
is going to be very good I always equate
[SPEAKER_04]: it to like the brewery industry if you're
going to be a lager be the lager make the
[SPEAKER_04]: same thing get big at that and make a lot
of it or if you want to be a craft brewer
[SPEAKER_04]: which is more of your craft mentality
there's still a good market there's still
[SPEAKER_04]: good market in the United States for that
too you have to be able to be very
[SPEAKER_04]: innovative you have to have the right
brands you have to go back and just very
[SPEAKER_04]: similar and touch people that are in your
area very similar to a craft brewer and
[SPEAKER_04]: then the third part third market a third
place that would really play at is more
[SPEAKER_04]: nutraceutical pharmaceutical products so
there's a huge amount of opportunities
[SPEAKER_04]: within this plant there's over 120
different cannabinoids you get over 400
[SPEAKER_04]: different terpenes there's a lot of
different things you can do you'll find
[SPEAKER_04]: find what really makes the niche that you
can you can get into a supplement or
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical find the right partners and
I would also say you know you find people
[SPEAKER_04]: like the people on this group and start
learning from them and figure out what
[SPEAKER_04]: what are you good at what do you want to
do and start playing in that space yeah I
[SPEAKER_03]: think that's actually the most important
part to your point the cannabis supply
[SPEAKER_03]: chain from cultivation to what it becomes
when you're purchasing it in a store
[SPEAKER_03]: whether that's a hash an edible pre-roll
flower tincture every one of those is
[SPEAKER_03]: produced and processed by somebody who
specializes in that particular particular
[SPEAKER_03]: discipline so and to add to your point
we're a very small San Francisco brand if
[SPEAKER_03]: you smoke cannabis in San Francisco
there's a likeliness you smoke some of our
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff outside of San Francisco probably
just you know maybe a few miles here and
[SPEAKER_03]: there because we're really hyper local we
focus on what the San Francisco smoker
[SPEAKER_03]: wants and that's very high potency so
everything that we grow everything that we
[SPEAKER_03]: make really caters to a high potency where
I think what you'll see in Europe because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's more of a novice market and you have
a lot of the so-called kind of curious
[SPEAKER_03]: that you will probably to this point kind
of be very successful with nutraceuticals
[SPEAKER_03]: with more approachable potencies that are
in the 18 to the 20 percent range so I
[SPEAKER_03]: think Europe will kind of find its own way
and its own preferences and cultivation as
[SPEAKER_03]: the years go on I think Alex can probably
speak a lot to the terpene profiles that
[SPEAKER_03]: Europeans enjoy
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to when we in Europe we like
a lot of course when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Romans that we enjoy the Romans the more
secure they are the more we're liking them
[SPEAKER_03]: and Timo what do you see as one of the
biggest light suppliers to cultivators I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: sure you've seen plenty of really
state-of-the-art facilities what do you
[SPEAKER_03]: see the strain profiles that are being run
here and I'm sure you also know what we
[SPEAKER_03]: run in California so you have a pretty
good idea of what the taste in Europe is
[SPEAKER_06]: versus versus us the question is do we
know the taste of Europe right so Europe
[SPEAKER_06]: is huge it's a continent and very very
different and with smaller choices also
[SPEAKER_06]: their taste will develop right now there
are areas where they have not these
[SPEAKER_06]: choices now so still taste and and you
know demand needs still to be developed
[SPEAKER_06]: but I I think it was a great discussion at
the beginning when we see you said
[SPEAKER_06]: something about focus now we saw we
learned from other market that a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: companies tried to be everywhere and that
really I mean everywhere at the same time
[SPEAKER_06]: and then totally vertically integrated you
know from I do my own genetics until
[SPEAKER_06]: extraction my own brand distribution and
so on this is for every business
[SPEAKER_06]: independent from cannabis so complex so I
think focus is important where is your
[SPEAKER_06]: play in the value chain and then also what
Nick easily said earlier don't develop
[SPEAKER_06]: your own lights don't develop your own
rats don't pick the things which work
[SPEAKER_06]: because then you can you know forecast and
make a business model in the business case
[SPEAKER_06]: which is for fitting the customer demand
what you said you know what is my business
[SPEAKER_06]: model who do I want to supply to and I
think this is it's interesting because we
[SPEAKER_06]: see all this right now developing into
different countries in Europe and yes
[SPEAKER_06]: exciting times but for entrepreneurs the
challenge is these times are totally
[SPEAKER_06]: unclear when it's regulation coming here
when it's happening that and having the
[SPEAKER_06]: agility in the business model to adopt is
I think very interesting to see who will
[SPEAKER_06]: then be successful because I think it will
be the one who are able to adopt the
[SPEAKER_05]: business model fast yeah I think that's
really on point edge that the key thing
[SPEAKER_05]: there is pick your area of expertise
whether it's cultivation whether it's
[SPEAKER_05]: manufacturing whether it's packaging if
you try it on them all a master of none
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know what we really see from
working based out of California and
[SPEAKER_05]: working in the vertical growing space with
many cultivators who have been successful
[SPEAKER_05]: is the ones who have really excelled you
know companies like Curely, Ferano,
[SPEAKER_05]: Nature Medicine and STEEZY they've really
focused on what they're good at and they
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't try to make everything themselves
like to your point making your own lights
[SPEAKER_05]: or racks yeah you could go that route but
you could be better off focusing on your
[SPEAKER_05]: your own systems process to be first in
that given field and also did I see it in
[SPEAKER_06]: our own company you know we we did a lot
of canvas lighting and then we decided oh
[SPEAKER_06]: let's go also to Europe and let's go do
also much more in you know food crops and
[SPEAKER_06]: the complexity was like boom so it's not
like I experienced every day in our own
[SPEAKER_06]: company how hard it is so focus is really
for us as well because it's immediately
[SPEAKER_06]: you need to put new people new you know
skill sets in the company and then it gets
[SPEAKER_06]: really difficult to scale and keep the
focus so yeah yeah and if you add to that
[SPEAKER_03]: that when when you're in a new cannabis
market like Germany or even you know
[SPEAKER_03]: markets that that legalize in the US the
states that do if you do let's say a
[SPEAKER_03]: processing place where you're just
processing oils or making you know white
[SPEAKER_03]: label stuff that will already generate you
a decent amount of business because to his
[SPEAKER_03]: point there is going to be a lot of
growers that don't manufacture themselves
[SPEAKER_03]: they're focused on cultivating and they
don't have brands so they want somebody to
[SPEAKER_03]: buy their bulk flour process that into
product so there is opportunities to to to
[SPEAKER_03]: start facilities and just make money on
the square footage of that facility even
[SPEAKER_03]: if you don't have a brand but to Timo's
point you have to focus on one thing
[SPEAKER_03]: you're good at are you going to make
creams and nutraceuticals are you going to
[SPEAKER_03]: do pre-roll joints but if you become good
at one thing your facility will generate
[SPEAKER_04]: revenue yeah I agree again I still equate
it back to you know any kind of craft
[SPEAKER_04]: industry so there you know there's 1,500
different varieties of strains out there
[SPEAKER_04]: if you try to do all 1,500 you probably
won't get the customer base that you want
[SPEAKER_04]: so your customers are going to be after a
while they're really like hey you make the
[SPEAKER_04]: best whatever so this crapper you might
say it's an imperial style and this might
[SPEAKER_04]: be a train wreck but these are the guys I
always go to I get the best train rack I
[SPEAKER_04]: get my best feeling from that that's where
I go they're my guy and I'm willing to
[SPEAKER_04]: drive by five other dispensaries to get to
them because that's my guy because what's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to happen is you'll be additional
dispensaries and the people that really
[SPEAKER_04]: are not connected with you are going to go
to the closest dispensary and that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to employ I think another
question that was asked was if what we see
[SPEAKER_03]: happening to the race to the bottom when
it comes to potency basically THC per
[SPEAKER_03]: milligram whether it's going to become
sort of a brand war to sell you the most
[SPEAKER_03]: THC per gram for the best price and I
think that's something that the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: panel can speak to I'll start with Travis
if you want to start that one we've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: it in California so I think you have a
little bit of experience already yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely I mean it's besides like the
from the brand standpoint right there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: few brands that have really done it pretty
well I think that they they have they're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing all right the whole vertical chain
but they are they have experts who they
[SPEAKER_05]: brought in for each thing and just try to
figure out themselves because you know
[SPEAKER_05]: going back to that point but I think the
race to the bottom is really going to come
[SPEAKER_05]: to who if you look at the price per pound
in California it went from you know 2,000
[SPEAKER_05]: to 800 right and if you're producing
pounds at 800 the whole time in the
[SPEAKER_05]: beginning you thought you're making a ton
of money and all of a sudden you can
[SPEAKER_05]: barely keep the doors open so I think if
you look at it from day one from a
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation standpoint how do I optimize
for as cheap as I can make it for at still
[SPEAKER_05]: holding the quality level that is you know
important to you and your customer whether
[SPEAKER_05]: that's to your point you know the highest
THC or the smoothest for the entry-level
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis curious consumer how do I get to
that four hundred dollar price point per
[SPEAKER_05]: pound to grow so that when I'm making two
thousand making even more and I can turn
[SPEAKER_05]: that money and reinvest into my business
but when it gets down to 800 I'm still
[SPEAKER_05]: profitable so process in any business that
you look at you know we fly planes and
[SPEAKER_05]: knock I would don't crash very often
because we follow processes that's a very
[SPEAKER_05]: long-standing industry we have to get to
that point to where everybody's following
[SPEAKER_05]: the same type of processes internally and
you know I grow glad we looked at that
[SPEAKER_05]: from a system standpoint with a
cultivation kind of task overview it's an
[SPEAKER_05]: educational components that we're working
on internally but that's where I see is a
[SPEAKER_05]: key thing is don't focus on how much money
you're making now focus on where's it
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna be in five years and optimize for
that day yeah I totally agree don't
[SPEAKER_03]: process at my manufacturing we've
implemented flourish which is a compliance
[SPEAKER_03]: and VRP software and that even you know
captures our cost of goods on latex gloves
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever but what that's done for us
it's increased our output by 30% while
[SPEAKER_03]: dropping our cost of goods like 7% but and
you also see what kind of wasted you have
[SPEAKER_03]: once you have systems in place that
actually track this so one tip that I have
[SPEAKER_03]: for people that are starting a cultivation
is first of all look at the time of the
[SPEAKER_03]: growth period of your strains if you're
running a 12 week strain that is an extra
[SPEAKER_03]: month of rent you have to pay where you're
not generating revenue so always keep a
[SPEAKER_03]: good mix of 12 8 and 10 week strains so
that you're always harvesting and always
[SPEAKER_03]: generating revenue so staggering your
staggering to grow is something that's
[SPEAKER_03]: really really important and the other
thing is you look to have to to Stuart's
[SPEAKER_03]: point the flavor profile maybe it's not a
super high-potency one but it has a really
[SPEAKER_03]: unique taste that people really want so
there is ways to manipulate your catalog
[SPEAKER_03]: to also be profitable not just for the
love of oh I want to grow this 12 week
[SPEAKER_06]: strain so you have to be have to pick them
well so to the question of the race to the
[SPEAKER_06]: bottom if we see the sales price yeah
there will be craft brewers there will be
[SPEAKER_06]: different business walls you can play and
maybe also sell premium but the big volume
[SPEAKER_06]: will be get under a lot of pressure it
will happen it's an agricultural product
[SPEAKER_06]: it's commoditized and it gets so pressure
will happen as it did for tomatoes as it
[SPEAKER_06]: did for a corn and whatever and so it's I
think having the operational spendings
[SPEAKER_06]: under control and the two biggest blocks
of your operational spendings if it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouse or in the facility will be
labor and electricity and labor to start
[SPEAKER_06]: the processes procedures and so on being
effectively you know I always like also
[SPEAKER_06]: the example of if I go into a Dutch
greenhouse it's it's beautiful right it
[SPEAKER_06]: runs like a perfect machine and 10-20
years ago they produced or in the example
[SPEAKER_06]: of tomatoes 80 kilograms sorry 40
kilograms and now 20 years later it's 80
[SPEAKER_06]: so they could increase production by 100%
and they thought back then they already
[SPEAKER_06]: had totally under control right so where I
want to go with that is if the prices drop
[SPEAKER_06]: sales price drop then you need to preserve
your gross margin by having your OPEX
[SPEAKER_06]: under control and that is electricity and
this is labor and these two things is
[SPEAKER_06]: important and if we now go back to the
example in California the prices drop and
[SPEAKER_06]: everyone who didn't have the OPEX under
control having for example HBS lights yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: then you have no operational income
anymore no gross profit and then you
[SPEAKER_06]: cannot survive right and to the point with
the matches I really like this we cannot
afford in Europe really I don't want that
all the matches burn through the end
[SPEAKER_06]: because we have the opportunity to take
learnings from other market and do right
[SPEAKER_06]: so it's all collectively our
responsibility to not repeat because
[SPEAKER_06]: actually we saw it already so let's make
it better I think it's important to add to
[SPEAKER_03]: that even in the u.s.
[SPEAKER_03]: there was always a lot of 30 40 year old
existing industry that had a say in what
[SPEAKER_03]: we had to do so you do have a clean canvas
and it is really nice to have a clean
[SPEAKER_03]: canvas and we do hope that Germany takes
from all the different states that
[SPEAKER_03]: legalize them it grabs the best of it
that's definitely the hope and I think
[SPEAKER_04]: Stuart had something I 100% agree with
what what what you're saying is so you
[SPEAKER_04]: have to run it like a real business it's
not you're not just gonna go hey I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in the weed business and I'm gonna get
rich it doesn't really work that way you
[SPEAKER_04]: have to work hard and there's a lot of
different ways to do it so certainly
[SPEAKER_04]: you'll labor electricity you're gonna look
at a return on investment you've had
[SPEAKER_04]: financial model people talked to you
earlier you're gonna you may have the
[SPEAKER_04]: cheapest operation but if you're not
getting yield that doesn't make a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: sense so you're gonna say I'm gonna pay X
amount to be able to get X amount of yield
[SPEAKER_04]: and whatever that number is it also
depends on what you want to grow so
[SPEAKER_04]: product selection is extremely important
branding you're gonna have to brand so you
[SPEAKER_04]: look at the companies there are plenty of
companies out there that are commodities
[SPEAKER_04]: look at bananas anybody here here of
Chiquita bananas probably everyone right
[SPEAKER_04]: because why because they branded their
product it just doesn't call it bananas
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm a commodity and they demand more
money for that and so you gotta get into
[SPEAKER_04]: the branding discussion and then there's a
matter of innovations and innovations
[SPEAKER_04]: certainly have a THC but then you're gonna
add in turkeys and turkeys to me are
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely important and let Alex talk to
that I'd like to say is that we see in
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe when it comes to the CBD business
at the end a good example of how it can go
[SPEAKER_02]: down and how you can lose your money for
your investment because a few years ago
[SPEAKER_02]: the price of tequila price was still of
4,000 euro and now you can buy 200 euro
[SPEAKER_02]: tequila so you can see that even the
investments back for indoor facilities for
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD flowers have been made millions and
millions and millions they are we nowadays
[SPEAKER_02]: not given anymore because the process and
drop so much because everybody started it
[SPEAKER_02]: without giving any regulation for nothing
again everybody's just winging it trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring the biggest proposal trying to
bring the biggest consultants right in the
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest investors trying to build the
biggest facilities and at the end you have
[SPEAKER_02]: bad outcomes the prices are dropping it's
too much and you will never get the
[SPEAKER_06]: investment back at the end so let us try
to make concrete how if we would have a
[SPEAKER_06]: magic wand and could say okay how it
should be Germany how would we build it
[SPEAKER_06]: let's discuss this because I get asked if
you would you limit the amount of licenses
[SPEAKER_06]: journey so then to produce so then it's
pretty good okay do we produce only in
[SPEAKER_06]: Germany or do we can we get also import so
let us discuss what do we think should
[SPEAKER_06]: Germany it's huge country over 80 million
people should they supply their own
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis or should they allow as well
import what do you guys think about that I
[SPEAKER_03]: think I'd like to kind of take the lead on
that being that I just still touch the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant every day and I've been cultivating
it for 20 years so I do take a little
[SPEAKER_03]: issue with saying that it's a commodity
it's a part of it is commoditized but when
[SPEAKER_03]: people spend 50 60 euros on you know five
grams of weed that's a really nice wine
[SPEAKER_03]: bottle that you could afford for that
price and great maybe a commodity but wine
[SPEAKER_03]: is not so I think we really need to
differentiate and when we grow hemp we can
[SPEAKER_03]: grow hemp like we grow corn we can't grow
cannabis like we grow corn cannabis the
[SPEAKER_03]: footprint of an individual plant takes
space you need to care for it you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: prune it it gets it gets a different
regimen of food every week of fertilizers
[SPEAKER_03]: it gets enzymes so there's a lot of work
that goes into creating really good
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis right so it while it gets
commoditized on like an outdoor for we see
[SPEAKER_03]: the commoditization California of out
outdoor weed we don't see that on indoor
[SPEAKER_03]: as much while the price has dropped
there's still a strong market for it so I
[SPEAKER_03]: think to transition to your point of what
to do in Germany I think yes the wheat
[SPEAKER_03]: should be grown locally that's sold in
Germany so you can foster small business
[SPEAKER_03]: so you can give outdoor farmers the chance
to grow a commodity but you give indoor
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers a chance to be craft brewers and I
think that's aligned with the German
[SPEAKER_03]: culture as well but would you do it only
only I'm for export but what I'm saying
[SPEAKER_03]: the first right of refusal the first right
to grow cannabis should be given to the
[SPEAKER_03]: locals but they should also be allowed to
export sure
[SPEAKER_05]: about saying I think you're gonna problem
on day one is that demand is going to
[SPEAKER_05]: create the out place supply right so
what's best for the transition period is
[SPEAKER_05]: likely going to be something where you
have to allow let's say 50% to be imported
[SPEAKER_05]: on year one and then you could trail that
down then 40% and then 30 20 all the way
[SPEAKER_05]: down to 10 I don't know that I would
necessarily agree that it should be zero
[SPEAKER_05]: is allowed from import but something along
a transition period otherwise you're just
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna have 10x the demand and if you say
there's no legal import it's just going
[SPEAKER_05]: it's gonna come into the black market
right so I don't disagree with that you
[SPEAKER_05]: need a transitional strategy sure yeah and
you know I think the way that we did to
[SPEAKER_05]: your point I told 100% agree I love the
brewery analogy you know there's in
[SPEAKER_05]: America there's there's the Budweiser
there's the Coors you know there's only a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of those guys but that to the quake
that that's your your outdoor grow quality
[SPEAKER_05]: is gonna be low it's gonna be inexpensive
but there are hundreds and more thousands
[SPEAKER_05]: even of flourishing microbreweries and
craft breweries who are looking at growing
[SPEAKER_05]: their indoor space and they're not trying
to sell to the world they're trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: sell to San Francisco right and they're
putting out an amazing product and I think
[SPEAKER_05]: that's why when you go back to that
operational efficiency you know for us I
[SPEAKER_05]: grow glad you know multi-tier growing is
crucial and if you look at that from an
[SPEAKER_05]: op-ed standpoint your first tier is gonna
cover your labor costs your second tier
[SPEAKER_05]: covers your rent and your third tier is
your pure profit and that's really how a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of people are transitioned to they
learn how to grow in a single tier outdoor
[SPEAKER_05]: but the ones who quickly transition to a
multi-tier like very process-driven
[SPEAKER_05]: environment are the ones who are winning
now so Europe can really look ahead and
[SPEAKER_05]: say like let's skip the waste of time to
your point power and space is really
[SPEAKER_05]: expensive and we talked about earlier in
the green room that the cost of
[SPEAKER_05]: transportation and supply chain you know
the your to your point cannabis is really
[SPEAKER_05]: old by the time it goes from Canada to
here or wherever and that's not really
[SPEAKER_05]: helping the quality inconsistency versus
if we can grow it inside of Berlin for
[SPEAKER_05]: instance and supply just Berlin that's
gonna save on a lot of things including
[SPEAKER_03]: you know benefits for the environment and
I think it's important to say to your
[SPEAKER_03]: point that a Budweiser and a craft brewer
can't live next to each other and both
[SPEAKER_03]: have a market the big brands attract they
attract attention they attract awareness
[SPEAKER_03]: they bring in a ticket price that's
affordable across all tax brackets and
[SPEAKER_03]: then you have your little nice gems that
you can pick from I think it should be
[SPEAKER_03]: driven by getting the consumers the
freshest best product whether that's from
[SPEAKER_03]: a commercial industrial outfit or from a
craft outfit yeah completely agree and
[SPEAKER_04]: certainly I've been on both sides of that
with cureleaf and and small crappers that
[SPEAKER_04]: a craft canvas guys that work with today
with agri-pie and it's really it's it's
[SPEAKER_04]: really you know that they work together
but a large cureleaf are large and you
[SPEAKER_04]: have like three large ones within Germany
those folks will help push regulations
[SPEAKER_04]: those folks will bring and drive process
improvements those folks will bring in
[SPEAKER_04]: product safety standards and instead of
having all these little guys trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: spend hundreds of thousands of dollars let
the big guys do that let them let some
[SPEAKER_04]: behave that way and don't try to compete
with it you don't need to compete with
[SPEAKER_04]: unless you unless you're the guy that runs
around here with two or three billion
[SPEAKER_04]: dollars and I'm guessing none of those
people are in this room and you're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: go like how do I get how do I get to the
craft side so you know you know back to
[SPEAKER_04]: Travis point you if you do vertical grows
you can do you know there there are four
[SPEAKER_04]: by eights section that's one strain so you
can do multiple strains within your
[SPEAKER_04]: facility which are you know which you can
keep on getting your customers more and
[SPEAKER_04]: more aware that the new thing so craft
brew and large brewery is a very good is a
[SPEAKER_04]: very good analogy and that's what I would
look at in as far as licenses as far as
[SPEAKER_04]: limiting I wouldn't limit any licenses and
I know that's not so popular but I would
[SPEAKER_04]: limit the licenses based on you have to
hit a product safety and product quality
[SPEAKER_03]: standard that's that should be your only
limitation I agree and I think it's also
[SPEAKER_03]: important to say that craft and commercial
we actually all use the very similar
[SPEAKER_03]: equipment so for you when you walk into
industrial group or you walk into my 200
[SPEAKER_03]: letters it's both fluency so it's
something that we all do use the same
[SPEAKER_03]: equipment it's really just the intent with
which you approach your cultivation not
[SPEAKER_06]: all unfortunately but we try we try our
best but what I heard what we are all
[SPEAKER_06]: saying I agree I would give license to
growers in Germany for Germany because you
[SPEAKER_06]: can create create value propositions and
branding here the brand Brandenburg or
[SPEAKER_06]: Berlin cash or whatever you can make a
nice training you can label it and this
[SPEAKER_06]: year people want that they want to be
associated with their with a community or
[SPEAKER_06]: region I see that but I totally agree we
need to enable and have in Germany import
[SPEAKER_06]: because we need so much weed unbelievable
to fight the black market and where I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: from in Bavaria a lot of people are buying
cannabis through the darknet and they are
[SPEAKER_06]: very well educated consumers because if
you go into the darknet it looks like an
[SPEAKER_06]: Amazon store but you have all the
references and all the customer reviews
[SPEAKER_06]: and so on so there must be volume and
choice because otherwise you just
[SPEAKER_06]: decriminalize the drug everyone's still
going to the dealer and we don't achieve
[SPEAKER_06]: the goals what the German government wants
to protect miners to get tax income and to
[SPEAKER_06]: ensure product quality and safety these
are the three main targets for the
[SPEAKER_06]: government this you don't have if you
don't have enough weed and everyone is
[SPEAKER_06]: just buying for less decriminalized from
the dealer and so I think we need to have
[SPEAKER_06]: enough and I really like this position
process of maybe phasing it slowly out to
[SPEAKER_06]: to to support you know German cultivators
but we also need to be clear on
[SPEAKER_06]: electricity in Germany is ridiculous
expensive and this country is pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: crowded already it's a tiny country with
80 million people's also permits and you
[SPEAKER_06]: know growing facilities to build them up
is expensive in Germany so I just hope if
[SPEAKER_06]: Germany gives regulation that it's long
term because if you cannot make your money
[SPEAKER_06]: three in three four five six years but
they change all of a sudden you compete
[SPEAKER_06]: all of a sudden cheaper cultivators
cheaper prices and then the business model
[SPEAKER_03]: is broken again well one thing I can
assure you that's happened in every other
[SPEAKER_03]: state and country that didn't legalize
cannabis is that you're nowhere looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: the near the final legislation it is that
I can I will put put money on that the
[SPEAKER_03]: other thing I do want to mention is to
your point with the black market one thing
[SPEAKER_03]: that I really feel like is lacking in the
German legislation is an incentivizing
[SPEAKER_03]: people that have had a record for selling
cannabis and give them a path to a legal
[SPEAKER_03]: industry and there's no program for it
they're not considering it in their laws
[SPEAKER_03]: and that is it's not fair towards those
that risk their freedom to make something
[SPEAKER_03]: socially acceptable but it's also
counterproductive to your goal of wanting
[SPEAKER_03]: to eliminate the black market I would take
every kid that's selling eights on a
[SPEAKER_03]: corner and give him a bud tender education
because that kid to your point will be a
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledgeable salesperson so I do miss the
restorative and the social equity justice
[SPEAKER_03]: component and in the legislation that
Germany is drafting and I wish they would
[SPEAKER_06]: put more effort into that do we know that
still I don't think that we know how they
[SPEAKER_06]: will change the ETMG law because they need
to if you legalize recreation cannabis you
[SPEAKER_06]: need to also change how right now
consuming cannabis is punished so that's
[SPEAKER_06]: this I personally have no view into but
they will need to change it because
[SPEAKER_03]: otherwise we have conflicting laws they
need to be incentivized or the people that
[SPEAKER_03]: are right now still dealing in the illegal
market you incentivize those people I was
[SPEAKER_03]: one of those and the city incentivized me
to come out of all my basement out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: back of the restaurant that I would get a
free record and they gave me a priority
[SPEAKER_03]: permit what did that do I invested two and
a half million dollars into building a
[SPEAKER_03]: business in the city so you have to
incentivize those to come out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: underground and then you end up being the
chair of the oversight committee and you
[SPEAKER_03]: have a voice and you have a voice for
people that didn't have a voice before but
[SPEAKER_03]: we're also one of the best manufacturers
our joints are the number one selling
[SPEAKER_03]: joints because we really love what we do
right we risked our lives for it so I just
[SPEAKER_03]: think the people that have had convictions
should have an opportunity now that
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody says hey it's okay to smoke weed
why don't they get an opportunity a first
[SPEAKER_03]: shot at the industry
[SPEAKER_03]: do we have do you have any more comments
because I think we were going to open up
[SPEAKER_02]: some public questions what I wanted to add
to Gimo before was that why also big
[SPEAKER_02]: reason why you have people more turn to
black market and then the black market
[SPEAKER_02]: educate you better than any pharmacist
just actually where you can get
[SPEAKER_02]: information or I can get any kind of
knowledge about what you would be growing
[SPEAKER_02]: how the benefit would be for you what kind
of benefits you could have if you go to
[SPEAKER_02]: the pharmacy you will look at you like it
could be this I don't know you're
[SPEAKER_06]: absolutely right and that is why it's so
interesting how the point of sale looks
[SPEAKER_06]: like you know if we wouldn't know how the
point of sale looks like we can also
[SPEAKER_06]: imagine how much they can sell and what
and who is selling it how much this person
[SPEAKER_06]: knows to educate so this is like one of
the questions which is yeah and you're
[SPEAKER_06]: right we hope for people who are in the
cannabis industry today being the people
[SPEAKER_06]: telling possible consumers what benefits
they have because in most cases they know
[SPEAKER_06]: it better than a pharmacist I have nothing
against pharmacists and it's not the point
[SPEAKER_06]: but they have not been part of the
industry so far so there's also a learning
[SPEAKER_04]: curve to take yeah it's the black market's
there it's not like if we act like we're
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna legalize it and then there's gonna
be weed the weed is already there people
[SPEAKER_04]: have been doing it for a long time and all
you have to do is basically say now you
[SPEAKER_04]: can do it the right way instead of all the
other stuff that goes on just take the
[SPEAKER_04]: people that already know how to do this
business and give them a license providing
[SPEAKER_04]: that you they have to meet certain
regulations for sure without that we don't
[SPEAKER_04]: want to hurt anybody but just give the
people that know how to do this the chance
[SPEAKER_03]: to do it yeah there's no bigger incentive
than not going to jail it's a great
[SPEAKER_03]: incentive I think we should start with
some questions from the audience if you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys have any
[SPEAKER_05]: while we're waiting for him to get a mic I
think you know everything's about like
[SPEAKER_05]: eradicating or getting towards a reduction
of black market is crucial the one big
[SPEAKER_05]: caveat there is like gonna be the
distribution right if it's if it's 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: on a Friday and you and your friends want
to you know get some good quality if you
[SPEAKER_05]: have to drive 25 miles even if you're like
I'm trying to support the legal market
[SPEAKER_05]: you're like I'm just gonna call my dealer
right so there needs to be that
[SPEAKER_05]: distribution market you know maybe Amazon
one day gets into drone deliveries and I
[SPEAKER_03]: think access is like I was asked in San
Francisco why we don't put a cap on retail
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses and I said well everybody should
be able to walk to a dispensary within 10
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes so until we have three or four in
every neighborhood that's accessible we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have enough because look at how many
liquor stores look how many species we
[SPEAKER_03]: have in bed right so why not we need
access everywhere like to your point
[SPEAKER_03]: shouldn't take you more than three blocks
to find a wheat shop yeah well I guess
[SPEAKER_02]: before the global services and everything
you just order it on just eat in a few
[SPEAKER_02]: years and we'll have to deliver it home
and with convenience like we have ease and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff they deliver it's it's convenient so
the question is we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: illicit versus legal market and one
category that feels completely not talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about but widely used in Germany is
hashish so I'm curious to hear what if any
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion you all have about hashish and how
that will will or could fit into this you
[SPEAKER_03]: know new world that's right in my
wheelhouse so we're the biggest hash maker
[SPEAKER_03]: in San Francisco and have won just several
awards this month for our temple balls
[SPEAKER_03]: hashish is so culturally ingrained here in
Germany that I think what you'll see is an
[SPEAKER_03]: explosion in the market of rosins,
turps sauces, diamonds, traditional hash,
[SPEAKER_03]: temple balls you'll see less and less of
the so-called shoe hash kind of that the
[SPEAKER_03]: flattened the flattened hash the way it
gets here right now but we see in
[SPEAKER_03]: California for example and hash is
exploding so the last this 710 is you know
[SPEAKER_03]: the official hash holiday so 710 hash
sales went up 70% and then they've kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: flattened out but they're overall up now
30% to what they were before we see an
[SPEAKER_03]: incredible explosion in hash I think to go
back to the point if I was making hash
[SPEAKER_03]: here I would definitely look into into
some you know local ethnicities and
[SPEAKER_03]: cultures that have that ingrained and I
could find a hell of a Lebanese hash maker
[SPEAKER_03]: here so I think hash will be a part where
Germany can really dominate some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: markets but it will be so hard to push
away the legal market it's like I can't
[SPEAKER_06]: even imagine it so we what we feel about
hashish we love it and we get great
[SPEAKER_06]: hashish from Morocco from Lebanese from
Afghanistan and they do it in massive
[SPEAKER_06]: fields and do amazing hashish it will be
brutally difficult to push this away for a
[SPEAKER_06]: good price point because quality is good
and but here the politicians have an
[SPEAKER_06]: interest because this is a product where
potentially and the quality could be
[SPEAKER_06]: somehow changed because you can mix easier
stuff in there than on the flour so
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a big interest to push away the
illegal market but it will be tough I
[SPEAKER_06]: think it will be very very tough to push
it away but who can and finds a sweet spot
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah a lot of consumer wants that for sure
and I think once you see a tested product
[SPEAKER_03]: with a lab test and then you see one
that's not tested then you see what they
[SPEAKER_03]: test for you're probably gonna go with the
tested product and to his point yes they
[SPEAKER_03]: make good land-raised techniques but
you're not gonna get a butter or a rosin
[SPEAKER_03]: that's like bright yellow or white from
them right you're not gonna get a sauce
[SPEAKER_03]: that pulls a spaghetti into your dad break
so yeah you'll have your choices but he's
[SPEAKER_03]: right you know you're spoiled with really
good street cashier that is an issue but
[SPEAKER_06]: it's also often contaminated that is that
is the issue but who's not saying that
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe Morocco is changing the laws it's a
sleeping giant who could also change the
[SPEAKER_06]: law and if Germany in have a bilateral
agreement with Morocco could be also that
[SPEAKER_06]: then it's getting important that was this
not not something what is not potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: possible right real optimist this one I
would have said in a real bright future
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe we have cultivation license in
Morocco and we can export an input the
[SPEAKER_02]: actual real hardship but legal this time
for Morocco and we can serve it everywhere
[SPEAKER_03]: there you go let's keep on dreaming does
that answer your question a little bit we
[SPEAKER_03]: have any other questions all right thank
you you you you you
