[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people went to the party last
night and still are making it here this
[SPEAKER_00]: morning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today's presentation is intended to
talk a little bit about data, and not just
[SPEAKER_00]: data for sake of talking about data,
but data that we actually know exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get started, I really want
to thank all the organizers from ICBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a really great conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually our third year here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to thank the team that's
working with me and Metric for getting us
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also want to thank all of you
again, too, for all the great panel
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions and experiences that have been
shared yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there's going to be more
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, as we've been listening to
everybody talk this last couple of days,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really started to solidify some of
the thinking that we have around what the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential is here in Europe for a larger
scale commercial market that includes more
[SPEAKER_00]: medical sales and also at some point adult
use sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to first of all just talk a
little bit about my background and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the work that we've done creating
centralized supply chain data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to talk a little bit
more about how that data actually gets
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioned into actionable insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll actually share a little bit of
information from inside the system that we
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize and then transition some of that
into some thinking about how that might
[SPEAKER_00]: actually look here in Germany and then
start to maybe prognosticate a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: on what a market here might look like in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know, and we've heard it quite a few
times this week, that there's I think a
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of disappointment and skepticism
around the path that Germany has charted
[SPEAKER_00]: for itself, especially since April of this
year when we all were kind of thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: this time last year when I was presenting
at the same conference that there was this
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for a very large German market
that would then also start to encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: other member states within the EU to take
up more canvas policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after April, I think everyone and like
we took a hard look at it too,
[SPEAKER_00]: saw this big market potential which we
knew was going to be challenging really
[SPEAKER_00]: shrink and almost get kicked down the road
a little ways where we're really starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to get concerned about how soon this was
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my background, so you know,
is both in government service but also in
[SPEAKER_00]: the private sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in government service, I was the
director of the Colorado Marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: Enforcement Division in 2013 going into
2014 when we first started adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized sales there in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, we had really three goals
that were preoccupying our thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was to do everything we
could to disrupt the illicit market and
[SPEAKER_00]: then supplant that illicit market with a
viable commercial market that could
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a much safer product at scale to
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third one, which was not
unimportant, but we wanted to limit the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of exposure that children had to
cannabis products, whether they were
[SPEAKER_00]: illicit products or commercialized
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was back in 2013 going into
2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the exact same goals that we
keep repeated by countries that are
[SPEAKER_00]: contemplating more permissive canvas
policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now since that time, we've been
part of and I've been part of close to two
[SPEAKER_00]: dozen different implementations of
cannabis policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we've seen it played out,
we've seen a lot of different approaches
[SPEAKER_00]: to that cannabis policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have seen a lot of successes and a
lot of failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we lay over all that experience
over the pathway that Germany has stated,
[SPEAKER_00]: we still see a viable path forward for a
commercial market at scale that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: done within the confines of a scientific
framework that would help not only address
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the concerns and the goals that
government has for legalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to actually build sustainable,
investable marketplace for cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: here, which is great news, I think for
everybody in the room who's really focused
[SPEAKER_00]: on kind of the business side of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to do today is I'm going
to use supply chain data to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: illustrate and substantiate some of the
things that we think could be outlined as
[SPEAKER_00]: success factors for countries in Europe to
follow based on kind of what we know from
[SPEAKER_00]: other marketplaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sticking with the nostalgic look back
on my experiences in government,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we first started regulating cannabis
in 2013 and 2014 for adult use in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, we were aware of the fact that
there was a dearth of data that was
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, one of the first things we
started to realize is that there were
[SPEAKER_00]: massive gaps in data where people assumed
there would be data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, we assumed that there was
data that existed already on youth
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption rates or driving under the
influence of cannabis or testing data,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we learned is that that data hadn't
been collected at all prior to adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a state and as a government,
we became hyper focused on trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect the right data to be able to
inform the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized at that time that we were
going to have to recreate the data
[SPEAKER_00]: structures to collect the data and start
all over with brand new baseline data,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is probably to some extent true in a
lot of the countries here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were also cognizantly aware of the fact
that the industry was brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have the same appearance that it
does in a lot of ways today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't uncommon at all for us to see
handwritten labels on products that were
[SPEAKER_00]: being sold at retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually saw concentrate production
done in slow cookers, we call them crock
[SPEAKER_00]: pots in the US, or washing machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw cold water extraction of cannabis
concentrates in older washing machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also saw packaging that was
probably more similar to what you would
[SPEAKER_00]: see at a high school bake sale than an
actual retail marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a lot of business
aptitudes that just didn't exist at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we knew that this would be
challenging for this new marketplace and
[SPEAKER_00]: the actors within the marketplace to
actually be able to comply with a
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive set of regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we needed a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed a tool to have some visibility
into the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we needed a tool to help start
collecting data so that we could describe
[SPEAKER_00]: what was happening in the marketplace to
the population at large, to demonstrate
[SPEAKER_00]: that there was some credit bill,
and then also be able to compare and
[SPEAKER_00]: contrast some of that data to showcase
what was happening in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also were really cognizant of the fact
that government success in this area of
[SPEAKER_00]: public policy is indelibly tied to the
business success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we wanted to make sure that the
tools were available for small,
[SPEAKER_00]: medium-sized businesses to be able to
comply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we landed on was supply chain
tracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a quick little overview of how
that worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works in almost every supply chain
tracking system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a physical tag that goes on every
plant that follows that plant all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through its life cycle, all the way up
until the point where it gets harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the plant material is packaged
into other things like trim to go to a
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer for concentrate productions,
or testing batches going to testing
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities, or buds going to storefronts,
all those products get packaged and they
[SPEAKER_00]: get transported to various other licensed
premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's tracked all the way through the
supply chain and all of those data events
[SPEAKER_00]: are collected from the time it's a little
baby plant all the way to the time it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sold at the point of sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every movement from one room to the
next, the date of the harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much the yields were, the results of
the tests, how much it sold for at
[SPEAKER_00]: wholesale, how long it took to transport
it to a facility, and then how much it
[SPEAKER_00]: sold for at the point of sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things and everything else is
collected along the entire supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So government has transparency into what
the licensed community or the regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: community is reporting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And businesses then, if the government
chooses to, can see a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregated data from the supply chain to
help make strong business decisions going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to illustrate this a little bit
further, we're going to talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more about some of the actionable data
that comes from having a center
[SPEAKER_00]: centralized platform where many of the
stakeholders within the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: co-create value with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've done is we've created
what we would call like a sample
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdiction or a fictional jurisdiction
to demonstrate some of what you can see in
[SPEAKER_00]: our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to start with two slides
that are going to be the bookends of the
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is like how much cannabis is output by
a particular market followed by what does
[SPEAKER_00]: that equate to in sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so think of this as a, if you're
trying to like frame the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample market that we've created for you,
think of it as a state that's somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between 10 to 12 million people in
population that has a longstanding medical
[SPEAKER_00]: program and an adult use program that's
been ramping up since around 2019 for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first full year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can see here, kind of looking
a couple years after this market's really
[SPEAKER_00]: been up and running, that the commercial
market takes time to be able to supply all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the inputs into the product categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2020, we are at 181 metric tons in
our sample market.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time we got to 2022, we were closer
to 925 metric tons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you put that into perspective,
you know, the Howe Cup study that was done
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Germany, where they estimated it
at 400 metric tons, this is a market of
[SPEAKER_00]: like 10 to 12 million, and we're seeing
something closer to 920 metric tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of reasons why that
might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be that edible products or
concentrates take up a big part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace, which also takes up more
plant material and many other different
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the most important thing to
understand is that even if, and this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of gets to my unapologetic optimism around
what could happen here in Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: is even if Germany were to legalize today
and intend on having their initial sales
[SPEAKER_00]: start January 1st of 2024, there is no way
that even the full-scale legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: model would be able to accommodate the
demand for cannabis here in Germany on day
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a matter of years for
that to be able to ramp up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we think about that in the
context of social clubs and model
[SPEAKER_00]: projects, they could potentially produce
if done well and at scale in a sizeable
[SPEAKER_00]: enough market of somewhere around 5 to 10,
12 million people of the German market,
[SPEAKER_00]: they could actually potentially produce a
fair amount of the product for the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: demand in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to kind of put this in perspective,
I think a lot of times, and again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is a little self-serving
because I have such close ties to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado model, but it's considered to be
one of the more mature marketplaces in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though it's been fully legalized
for a number of years now, since 2014 when
[SPEAKER_00]: the first sales began, less than half of
the local jurisdictions in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado allow for cannabis commercialized
operations within the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at a state like
California, which is massive, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to get close to like half the
size of Germany in terms of population,
[SPEAKER_00]: it also has a local approval requirement
in its law, and less than half of those
[SPEAKER_00]: local jurisdictions have allowed for
cannabis commercialized activities in
[SPEAKER_00]: their jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that supply in those states
that goes to people who live in cities or
[SPEAKER_00]: counties that do not allow for
commercialized cannabis, they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: able to supply the cannabis that people
are going to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was one end of the bookend,
the inputs into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the other end, this is the sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at our sample market,
we see that buying patterns are also a
[SPEAKER_00]: little slower to shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overnight, consumers are not going to
trust that the commercial market and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the products that are produced in that
market are fit for their needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there just might be supply shortages
that prevent that from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see that buying patterns also kind
of follow a similar trajectory where the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers are purchasing more and more
over time, and then businesses are ramping
[SPEAKER_00]: up or scaling their operations to be able
to meet that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it doesn't happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit of time for this to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a bit of an eye chart,
so I'm going to take a little bit of time
[SPEAKER_00]: to explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've looked at both all the inputs to
the supply chain, and we've looked at what
[SPEAKER_00]: the total sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can start taking a look at the
breakdown of sales, or what the breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: sales look by product category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for you all in the upper left-hand
corner of the screen is the market share
[SPEAKER_00]: per product category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have seven categories that we've
listed here for our sample marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did here is we took the sales
that we had from the previous slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we broke it down within the
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can start to get a little better
understanding of how much of the various
[SPEAKER_00]: product categories are purchased and
consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our slide here, roughly 45% to 50%
of the market has consistently been with
[SPEAKER_00]: smokeable bud that goes directly to the
store from cultivations, followed by
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think of concentrates as essentially
like vaping products and other types of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates, along with infused edibles
that are a bit of a distant third in
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison to those two categories of buds
in concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the right-hand side,
because this is a very important issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: is you're able to actually track what
happens to pricing of products over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a saturated market where we think
that there's overproduction of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes we see prices really starting
to decline rather than the scenario that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have here, where cannabis bud is
actually kind of like continuing to climb
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the first five years of
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also start to see concentrate
productions start to decline in this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, don't know exactly why that is,
but this is giving us some information to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like indicate that there's a
change or a shift in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to go back here to this
slide real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of the product categories,
the graph at the bottom is just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: charting out how sales in each one of
those product categories has changed from
[SPEAKER_00]: the early inception of legalization all
the way to 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, we just kind of take a closer look
at the buds and concentrates and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happened with those over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they seem to be kind of like
competing with one another for market
[SPEAKER_00]: space in this particular sample market
that we created for you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also might be on the concentrate
side that those have become much more
[SPEAKER_00]: popular products, and so they're producing
more and more of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as more of them are available in the
supply chain, then the prices are
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom line, though, is that we can
always look, again, kind of going back to
[SPEAKER_00]: this slide, we can always kind of look at
these things to get a closer look at and
[SPEAKER_00]: more detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I'm showing you the aggregate
kind of bigger picture data, we can drill
[SPEAKER_00]: down all the way into, or government can
drill down all the way into the different
[SPEAKER_00]: categories of products to get more
insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which also is kind of like, kind of gets
us to this next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though, as I mentioned earlier,
part of the reason we want to have a kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of centralized collection point for data
is so that we can inform and evolve the
[SPEAKER_00]: policy as we see changes in the
marketplace that might be negatively
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting businesses within that regulated
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the more common things that we
hear when concerning ourselves about
[SPEAKER_00]: market segments is, what is the impact
going to be when adult use is implemented
[SPEAKER_00]: on medical programs that already existed
beforehand?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we see here is kind of like a
common pattern that we've seen in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different states where the adult use
legalization, as it's ramping up,
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually see increases in patient
counts and medical sales as the regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use market is really kind of
starting to take hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as the adult use sales surpass
the medical sales, then we start to see
[SPEAKER_00]: those decline back to what they were prior
to legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there could be a lot of reasons for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have to do with pricing and adult
use and medical being in parity with one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so patients migrate back towards the
adult use market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like in some of our states,
we actually see where the medical sales
[SPEAKER_00]: are staying somewhat steady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be because the products
that are offered to patients are
[SPEAKER_00]: altogether different than the products
that are offered in the adult use market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are markets still in the US where
the medical products are more focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: high potency, low calories versus lower
potency products that are offered in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: At any rate, if you look at the data
that's down towards the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: slide, it's a lot of data, but it's still
looking at how, not only are we looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the different segments in gross sales,
but we're also looking at how those
[SPEAKER_00]: different customers and their buying
patterns are shifting over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can tell if patient purchases are
shifting away from smokable cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates or edibles or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can take a much closer look at
what's happening in the marketplace to
[SPEAKER_00]: make informed decisions about that,
both as a business but also as government
[SPEAKER_00]: actors too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a closer look at the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I think is really important
to mention here is, or just like to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of point out to you, is the number 226.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we put our data together,
we ended up with actually a fairly high
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any cultivators here in the audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so you know that's a pretty
high number, what you'd probably celebrate
[SPEAKER_00]: if you had 226 that you packaged out of
every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a pretty sizable number.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this is like intended to be
directional and give us an insight into
[SPEAKER_00]: what the marketplace looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is along the Y axis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 2018 to 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: And across the X axis is January to March.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a heat map.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lighter the color, the less the
yields were on average during that month.
[SPEAKER_00]: The darker the color, the higher the
yields were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at this from a different
perspective, you'll see that almost every
[SPEAKER_00]: September and October, there's this
massive spike in the number or the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of yield per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that almost always has to do with that
being the time of year where outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivations, which are included in our
sample jurisdiction, are harvested and
[SPEAKER_00]: they tend to have a little bit higher
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the takeaway from this though is,
and what's really interesting and happy to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk more detail with anybody in the room
about this is later, is we did an analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: on what this might mean for social clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a social club, just say it was like
200 grams was the gold standard per plant
[SPEAKER_00]: you harvested, if you were only able to do
that like 65 percent of that your first
[SPEAKER_00]: year in production, and you had 500
customers as part of, or 500 members as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of your social clubs, and assuming
that those three plants that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to home grow can be delegated to
the social club, a social club,
[SPEAKER_00]: a good grower would be able to harvest
those three plants four times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they were able to do that,
and assuming that the numbers that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: using to kind of inform the analysis out
of our system, they'd actually be as big
[SPEAKER_00]: or bigger than 50 percent of the regulated
cultivations that exist in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are rough directional numbers,
but social clubs could potentially be
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly sized, and so that kind of
gets us thinking about like the different
[SPEAKER_00]: schools of thought on how social clubs
should be structured going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that if they can be sizable,
that there probably should be some form of
[SPEAKER_00]: sensible kind of like small scale
regulation and transparency of that
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace, and then the other side of it
that we think about a lot is the reality
[SPEAKER_00]: that those social clubs are probably going
to at some point want to transition into
[SPEAKER_00]: the fully regulated for-profit model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thinking strategically now,
like how do we start to collect data on
[SPEAKER_00]: those so that we can better understand how
they're impacted over time when the market
[SPEAKER_00]: continues to grow with regional model
projects, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I want to kind of transition a
little bit out of that, but before I do,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I want to just like really drive home
on all the data that we just looked at in
[SPEAKER_00]: the previous half a dozen or so slides is
that that data that we've collected has
[SPEAKER_00]: been proven in every state that we
operate, and we operate in 23 different
[SPEAKER_00]: states, plus there's other companies that
do similar work to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost every state in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and Canada, they do some form of track and
trace data and that data has been proven
[SPEAKER_00]: to be evidentiary in value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's evidentiary in value in a
judicial system, it can also certainly be
[SPEAKER_00]: used as evidence to support science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've heard a couple of times
today that it's very important,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever framework gets adopted in the U
under current circumstances for regional
[SPEAKER_00]: model projects has to fit into a
scientific framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that the data that exists
right now for describing what happens in
[SPEAKER_00]: the markets and then being able to compare
and contrast between the various regional
[SPEAKER_00]: model projects is a viable path forward
for creating regional model projects that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be done at scale so that the market
supports business models like all of yours
[SPEAKER_00]: and it also supports investment into those
business models, something that makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into the thought experiment on
Germany, and to kind of elaborate a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more on what I just shared,
we took some sample data from our system
[SPEAKER_00]: and we randomly plugged it into Germany,
kind of like pretending that Germany's
[SPEAKER_00]: been legalized or we've been tracking
cannabis data for the last five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I mentioned that it's really
important from a scientific standpoint for
[SPEAKER_00]: government officials to be able to
describe and compare and contrast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've randomly assigned data from
different areas within the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: market into states to kind of just
demonstrate for you, please don't put a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of stock on these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we really think that there's
going to be a billion dollars in sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Bavaria, I think we know Bavaria is
probably one of the states that may be
[SPEAKER_00]: slower to take up regional projects,
but the idea is that you're able to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the data that's collected within a shared
system where everyone's co-creating value
[SPEAKER_00]: and be able to compare and contrast what's
happening in those regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can even take a little bit
deeper dive into those various regions and
[SPEAKER_00]: get a better understanding of what might
be happening with those, like for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: with product category sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just one example and we could look
at test results, we could look at
[SPEAKER_00]: transports, we could look at plant yields,
we could look at almost anything that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the system and we can start to be able to
compare and contrast what's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: within those regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think this is a very important
aspect of creating a scientific framework
[SPEAKER_00]: and we also think it kind of fits into
that definition, although it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit different way of thinking than I think
we've seen in other attempts at adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization outside of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I want to kind of like close
with a couple of thoughts that we've had
[SPEAKER_00]: as we are watching closely what's
happening here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is we're actually really excited about
what the potential is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons why we're so
excited is we've seen this replicated time
[SPEAKER_00]: and time again where government
collaborates with the industry and other
[SPEAKER_00]: stakeholders that exist within the
ecosystem to support an industry's effort
[SPEAKER_00]: to supplant the illicit market and replace
it with safer products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been able to see government
balance the regulatory requirements,
[SPEAKER_00]: not always, but in some cases be able to
balance those regulatory requirements with
[SPEAKER_00]: the business needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the businesses have been
successful and while we recognize,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're not tone deaf to the reality
that the market in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and North America in general is definitely
experiencing some hardships along with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the other economic downturn that
exists, but we do know that if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: the right data structures in place,
they can help to inform that policy when
[SPEAKER_00]: things are a little bit tougher and able
to right size the regulation over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what happens, you're not going
to get the regulations and the laws
[SPEAKER_00]: correct the first time, so you have to
have the right data there to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: inform how different actors within the
market are being impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that at the same time
collaborating and partnering on what's
[SPEAKER_00]: important to protect youth and public
health within the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've seen traceability platforms
work successfully in a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put that into perspective of what's
happening here in Europe and in particular
[SPEAKER_00]: today, it's focusing a little bit more on
Germany, is that research is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: key for regional model projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that the research can be
structured in such a way as well as where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have a scalable regional model
marketplace that's investable and
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that while that's happening
that this could also be done alongside of
[SPEAKER_00]: what is already a viable medical market
here in Germany that can coexist alongside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the adult use market, but to ensure
that that's more likely to happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: we think that it's important for the data
to be collected so that you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of showcase and be able to
demonstrate what different decisions on
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulatory front kind of impact that
they're having on various segments of the
[SPEAKER_00]: market, including the medical market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one, just recognizing
the fact that every time, every time with
[SPEAKER_00]: almost without exception where there's
been a small allowance or a modest
[SPEAKER_00]: allowance for like an unregulated
non-profit framework for providing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whether it's in medical or
whether it's in adult use, it always,
[SPEAKER_00]: always takes on the form of a commercial
market at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not right out of the chute,
but a couple of years down the road or so
[SPEAKER_00]: it almost always takes on the appearance
of a commercial framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since we know that to be the case,
and we know that social clubs has the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential to be one of the key policy
levers that Germany wants to pull here,
[SPEAKER_00]: then knowing that those are eventually
going to be taking on a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance, then now's a really good time
to start thinking strategically about how
[SPEAKER_00]: social clubs can scale and grow to meet
some of the demand out of the chute,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also have a viable option at some
point in the future to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: transition into what we also think is
likely to happen, which is a more full
[SPEAKER_00]: scale adult use marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll close right where I started,
which is our experience tells us that
[SPEAKER_00]: government's successful implementation of
cannabis policy is tied very closely to
[SPEAKER_00]: business success.
[SPEAKER_00]: If businesses are not successful in a
regulated framework, the perception is,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's grounded in reality,
is that the government wasn't successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to have both of those
entities among another, like another
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of different sets of stakeholders
that exist within the ecosystem around
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis regulation to be able to work
together and collaborate for the common
[SPEAKER_00]: good, the public health and safety
concerns, but also the important aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: of creating a sustainable market where
businesses can thrive over the long haul.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you again for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm really close to being right on
time for where we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank you again for all
being here this morning and waking up
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to the extent that we can elaborate on
any of the data that I showed today,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to meet with people one-on-one
and share some of our dashboards and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of our data and expand on some of our
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also happy to hear pushback and
different opinions on how we think this
[SPEAKER_00]: might go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm the unapologetic optimist in
the room when it comes to what we think is
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, but it's grounded in a lot of
the experiences that we've seen watching
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis regulation unfold in a couple
dozen different jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again for the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis Koski.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
