[SPEAKER_10]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go ahead and have these
gentlemen introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll start with Daniel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Daniel Heyman.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from Zurich, Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a lawyer in a mid-sized law firm
specializing in corporate commercial law
[SPEAKER_05]: and cannabis law, health, and product
regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sebastian Perch.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in the supervisory board of Cannify
AG.
[SPEAKER_06]: As well as the CEO of Midi Orbis,
a online publisher with a big reach in
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis topics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Benedict from Cannativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in the cannabis space for over six
years right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Founded the company together with my
brother Jacob.
[SPEAKER_03]: For those who are not familiar with
Cannativa, our vision is to enable
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, and we're building the largest
cannabis platform in Europe, and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: offering the most desirable products and
brands at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Distributing over 300 kg of product into
German pharmacies on a monthly base,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we are the exclusive partner for the
distribution of cannabis from domestic
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, my name is Konstantin van der Grubben.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the co-founder and managing director
of Demekan, and we are one of those
[SPEAKER_09]: companies that are producing medical
cannabis in Germany, and handed over to
[SPEAKER_09]: Benedict's team to have it then
distributed to pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just heard my co-founder speak,
Cornelius Maurer, who's now on our board,
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm still running the company,
mostly focusing on the public affairs
[SPEAKER_09]: division right now, and have a close look
at what the regulation will do about
[SPEAKER_09]: medical cannabis and about recreation
cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad to be here with all of you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess we'll just dive right in.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you guys think is going to be the
driving force for the European markets in
[SPEAKER_10]: one to three years?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that's not necessarily... I
mean, we could look out six months and
[SPEAKER_10]: have a very different conversation,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to go ahead and start?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: One to three years is a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, the next three months will,
I think, be very crucial for Germany,
[SPEAKER_09]: because that's when we'll actually see the
draft law on the new cannabis regulation,
[SPEAKER_09]: and that will apply both to medical
cannabis and recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: There will be a recreational cannabis
scheme.
[SPEAKER_09]: We heard Peter from Denton's talk about
the two pillars of all of that,
[SPEAKER_09]: but we'll also see an amendment of the
medical cannabis world, and that will have
[SPEAKER_09]: a tremendous effect on how the market will
look like in the next one to three years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have a very positive attitude
towards what is coming, because we'll see
[SPEAKER_09]: two things, I think, in the German medical
market.
[SPEAKER_09]: One is a reclassification of medical
cannabis from a narcotic down to a regular
[SPEAKER_09]: Rx medicine that will make access much
easier for patients and prescription much
[SPEAKER_09]: easier for doctors, and we'll see a market
increase of the medical cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second element is, I believe that
we'll see more domestic production of
[SPEAKER_09]: medicinal cannabis in Germany,
and that's good, obviously, for DemiCan,
[SPEAKER_09]: but also for other players who want to
enter the market of cultivating cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: in Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: So with this positive attitude,
I think we'll see a positive development
[SPEAKER_09]: also for the next one to three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually couldn't agree more,
especially the reclassification or
[SPEAKER_03]: rescheduling of cannabis as a non-necotic
would be a real game changer, but would be
[SPEAKER_03]: also a accelerator for the whole
commercial market of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: and in particular for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ask me, I could imagine there could
be a 5x on a addressable market,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe not in three months, but rather in
like two or three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this can be very likely and shifts
also the whole discussion and the focus on
[SPEAKER_03]: the medical market, because, of course,
adult use, legalization, it's all that we
[SPEAKER_03]: want, but at the moment, let's face it,
we're talking in the first pillar about a
[SPEAKER_03]: non-commercial home-grow approach and
cannabis social clubs approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the second part of this first pillar,
which is the reclassification,
[SPEAKER_03]: is probably the game changer and can give
the whole industry a lot of momentum,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'm also very positive about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Having a look at Europe, we're also
looking at the UK and Poland.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can see some traction gaining in
Switzerland, and we also have a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: small countries, for example, Malta,
who are not so interesting in terms of
[SPEAKER_06]: their population, size, however,
they are also pushing the front line of
[SPEAKER_06]: legalization a little bit more forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think in the next one to three years,
we will see a lot of markets opening in
[SPEAKER_06]: the medical field.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will see, as my colleagues outlined,
a very easy process of prescribing medical
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis in Germany, thus a strong growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it is still one of the biggest
growth potentials in Europe, and so,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, I'm looking very much forward to the
next years, because I think there is not
[SPEAKER_06]: that many markets that actually have the
potential of a two-digit growth rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually fully agree with your last
point, this huge growth potential.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are asking me if I'm pessimistic or
optimistic, a pessimist is an optimist
[SPEAKER_05]: with experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm still an optimist, though,
because I really think in the medical
[SPEAKER_05]: markets, and Peter mentioned it before,
the bottleneck is really getting doctors
[SPEAKER_05]: to prescribe medical cannabis and to
remove the boundaries, which are
[SPEAKER_05]: plentiful, we can speak about this in more
detail, but the medical market really is
[SPEAKER_05]: kicking off, and in Switzerland,
where I'm from, most barriers,
[SPEAKER_05]: regulatory barriers, where you require the
special permit to get cannabis from the
[SPEAKER_05]: Federal Office of Public Health,
has been removed, and every doctor can
[SPEAKER_05]: prescribe it, but most doctors don't know
how, when, why, they need education,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we need to tackle that problem first
and foremost.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when it comes to other markets,
like the recreational market, their true
[SPEAKER_05]: three-month is a long time, but at the
same time it isn't, I think it's gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: take much, much longer, and when we see
the developments here in Germany,
[SPEAKER_05]: which unfortunately have taken a very sour
turn, from my perspective, we're gonna see
[SPEAKER_05]: a similar situation in Switzerland,
unless the government is gonna be very
[SPEAKER_05]: innovative and very courageous,
which I doubt they will be, so I think on
[SPEAKER_05]: the rec side, we're gonna have to sit it
out for quite a long time to see any
[SPEAKER_05]: reasonable commercialization possibility
that could scale on this scale.
[SPEAKER_10]: So going back to that, do you think which
European nation is sort of positioned to
[SPEAKER_10]: sort of have success in that short period
of time, like 18 months or so,
[SPEAKER_10]: do you think it's gonna be the ones that
are more open, or do you think it's gonna
[SPEAKER_10]: be?
[SPEAKER_05]: The question is how do you define success?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you targeting medical cannabis so
countries who are removing, for example,
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis from the Narcotics Act,
apparently Germany is going in that
[SPEAKER_05]: direction, that's gonna have a direct
impact on how cannabis is prescribed,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe release or remove some of the
barriers, make it more accessible,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's for me a huge and very important
step.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, also it's a blurry line,
recreational and medical, so there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: question how far can you stretch the
medical definition, and then when you're
[SPEAKER_05]: speaking about recreational, I think
really Switzerland is a pretty good spot
[SPEAKER_05]: at the moment, I would say.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's the number one mover,
but we have pilot projects that are going
[SPEAKER_05]: on in Switzerland already for a while,
and I think the structure and the setup of
[SPEAKER_05]: these projects have been very carefully
designed and could be a very good base to
[SPEAKER_05]: scale throughout Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one thing you said is very
important to notice, that's the question,
[SPEAKER_09]: how far can you stretch the definition of
medical cannabis?
[SPEAKER_09]: And once Germany reclassifies cannabis
from a narcotic to an RX, I think we can
[SPEAKER_09]: stretch the definition of medical cannabis
very, very, very far.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then yes, we can keep talking about
the recreational market, but that will
[SPEAKER_09]: essentially be just a home growers market,
maybe cultivation associations,
[SPEAKER_09]: it will be a very small portion of the
market.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think for the foreseeable future,
an expanded and much broader definition of
[SPEAKER_09]: medical cannabis will be the thing we see
in Germany, and that's what will make
[SPEAKER_09]: Germany the go-to place for cannabis,
I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also that might be interesting for
you, also for international companies,
[SPEAKER_09]: because as my co-founder Cornelius has
pointed out, in a medical market,
[SPEAKER_09]: imports will probably still be possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's good news for the international
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think just adding to that,
I think there will always be a certain
[SPEAKER_06]: amount of cannabis consumers that actually
want a medical product in terms of purity,
[SPEAKER_06]: in terms of safety, and in terms of
cleanliness and quality.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Hernando, I don't know where to jump
to next.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, we could talk about quality,
because I heard people from South Africa
[SPEAKER_09]: on the panel, I heard a couple of guys
from Colombia, and we discussed imports,
[SPEAKER_09]: and imports are gonna be, as I said,
they will remain a factor, but you guys
[SPEAKER_09]: have to focus on quality.
[SPEAKER_09]: And right now we see a couple of products
in the market, for some reason they
[SPEAKER_09]: magically got a EU GMP certification,
or like kind of tested into EU GMP in
[SPEAKER_09]: Germany, but quality is going to matter,
I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: We also see a price compression right now
in the market, so now the debate is going
[SPEAKER_09]: to, what's gonna happen in the medical
cannabis market?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what will define good quality,
and what will the role be of price?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure, Benedikt, you have a very
good oversight, that being one of the
[SPEAKER_09]: large importers here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really agree on that, so that just those
two streams that can be successful,
[SPEAKER_03]: clear quality differentiation,
or focus on price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite a few companies right now,
and this is also what happens,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's also part of how the industry
currently works, is that a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: companies in the first half of this year
got bankrupt, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're out of business, they sourced
the wrong products that they can't market,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's also important that you understand
what kind of products you're sourcing,
[SPEAKER_03]: why you're sourcing them, and to whom
you're selling them, and I believe using
[SPEAKER_03]: quality product is probably not a bad
approach, but on the other hand,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're struggling a little bit when it
comes to the market, the market size,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least for the last 12 months,
we are talking rather about 10,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe 20% market growth, compared to very,
very high growth in the past, so the
[SPEAKER_03]: situation that we might be faced,
that we have a reclassification of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis will really trigger, again,
a lot of momentum into the market,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of new players might try to access
the market, we might get a whole new
[SPEAKER_03]: competition in the market, but I also
believe that those that are in the market
[SPEAKER_03]: already, that have established supply
chains, that have also low-cost sourcing
[SPEAKER_03]: supply chains in place, and quality supply
chains, they have pretty much had start
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to all the others.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think if it comes to
differentiation, it's not only important
[SPEAKER_06]: to have actually products that can
differentiate, but also to let the market
[SPEAKER_06]: know it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Germany, especially in the medical
market, we figured out that it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: enough to tell all the patients,
you gotta have the doctors, the
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmacists, and the patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it'll be incrementally
important for companies within the next
[SPEAKER_06]: one, two, three years to actually have a
proper marketing approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe just one remark to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a lot of potential to
actually execute on marketing if we have a
[SPEAKER_03]: reclassification of cannabis, because
that's also important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, it's narcotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as an industry, we are very,
very limited about addressing any other
[SPEAKER_03]: people than doctors and pharmacists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's a non-narcotic, there are at
least easier ways to talk more open and
[SPEAKER_03]: more public about those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I totally agree, education,
information, marketing will be very
[SPEAKER_03]: important things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also here, other countries can
hopefully look into the German market and
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe learn, adapt, do things smarter,
better than we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, as a narcotic, we are faced
with a very limited system when it comes
[SPEAKER_03]: to marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a few thoughts on price sensitivity
to quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you take a step back and you
look at the medical markets, the question
[SPEAKER_05]: is also what kind of delivery forms are we
looking at and where is the trend going?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this extreme sensitivity mostly
applies, I would say, to cannabis flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you're looking at cannabis
extracts or even some products that may in
[SPEAKER_05]: the future be synthesized that may also
find their way into the medical market,
[SPEAKER_05]: these small differences, whether you
produce at 150 or two bucks or three,
[SPEAKER_05]: it just doesn't matter because the price
points are completely different.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's really important to also
take these trends into consideration.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we're speaking about a certain
addressable market in the medical space,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially when you say we can stretch at
some stage the definition of what medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis is, you also have to put this
thought into the mix and think about maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: for a certain specific product,
I just use biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just doesn't matter how much it
costs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe also there, the quality,
the preservation of the bud and the drying
[SPEAKER_05]: and all of that, it's on a different
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a different importance to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say that the US saw that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Prices compress drastically for certain
regions.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was $3,000 a pound and it went down to
below $600, which drives to the points of
[SPEAKER_10]: where is that production going to come
from.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's for a different topic.
[SPEAKER_10]: So going back, do you guys think that how
important is the UN Single Convention
[SPEAKER_10]: going to be to the countries in Europe
that are looking into this?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the UN Single Convention is
the go-to authority here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is not because it's a UN
convention, but it's been adapted into
[SPEAKER_09]: European legislation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's EU law.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's quite binding for Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is why, if we ever see a
recreational market, we'll not have
[SPEAKER_09]: imports into the market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not because it makes sense economically.
[SPEAKER_09]: I totally agree with the guy who asked the
question from South Africa.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm saying, Colombia, doesn't that make
sense to produce somewhere else where it's
[SPEAKER_09]: much more affordable?
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course it would make sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the regulation just doesn't allow it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So always be mindful of where the
regulation goes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because this market is not driven only by
economics.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say it's mostly driven by the
regulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the UN convention is something that
even the German legislator is bound to.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have to like it by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in addition to that, at the same
time, the draft bill or the pillars that
[SPEAKER_03]: are now discussed totally reflect that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are already in a position where the
legislator and the regulator understands
[SPEAKER_03]: not only the UN Single Convention,
but includes them into all the
[SPEAKER_03]: discussions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, it's more like, do we like it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or don't we like it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really matter because it is
already integrated in the political
[SPEAKER_03]: discussion over already like two cycles of
those kind of papers that were published
[SPEAKER_03]: in October and March and April,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to accept that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe in the long run, if we think about
global economy, about global supply
[SPEAKER_03]: chains, there might be the possibility
for, example, imports.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we're talking rather about a
decade or two decades, but not about the
[SPEAKER_03]: near to midterm, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we'll see that faster.
[SPEAKER_09]: Germany is trying, and they have now
figured out a way to abide by the
[SPEAKER_09]: convention and still go forward with
cannabis regulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Netherlands has started a model
project.
[SPEAKER_09]: Czech Republic is eager.
[SPEAKER_09]: I only kind of see maybe a couple of
Eastern European states and France kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: opposed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once they see the economic benefit for
Germany from the new cannabis regulation,
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they'll all join together and
we'll see EU regulation for cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: medical and recreational.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's more like five years,
maybe five years away from now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it'll take at least five
years because currently there is no
[SPEAKER_06]: majority for European legislation on
cannabis in terms of legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I think we are stuck with the
current situation and we'll have to make
[SPEAKER_06]: the best out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe just to clarify, I was very much
referring to a global supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, I would definitely agree it
can be a harmonized system, whatever it
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like, rather than like five years
than in 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to clarify.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have to keep telling the regulator
because it's kind of ridiculous that the
[SPEAKER_09]: prohibition going on, especially for
medical cannabis, it's so ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're losing so much money.
[SPEAKER_09]: People are consuming cannabis anyways.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who of you has been to Berlin
last weekend at the Mary Jane conference,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You have the impression that there is
already a full scale recreational cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: market going on, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the draft legislation, the person who
drafted this first draft law, she writes
[SPEAKER_09]: that one or two out of four Germans have
consumed cannabis in the last 30 days,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: They are aware we're all smoking.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all smoking, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's ridiculous that we still have this
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we all need to have a concerted
approach.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's push the regulator to accept
realities and come up with a smart
[SPEAKER_09]: regulation to make the situation better by
controlling the quality and by controlling
[SPEAKER_09]: the access, not by prohibition,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Daniel?
[SPEAKER_10]: I fully agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's me again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm an agronomist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did my PhD in physiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been working in the cannabis
space for the past six years, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing the plant and see how we can grow
it better and cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've faced two problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: During my time in cannabis won a lot of
prejudices from cannabis coming from South
[SPEAKER_01]: America and Colombia and to lack of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is the biggest one and is
what you mentioned, Constantine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like people believe that because
we grow cannabis at a lower price,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has no good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a huge mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are several reasons why we
grow cannabis cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because hand labor in our
countries is cheaper, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, our land is cheaper, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And our wages for good professionals like
myself are not as high as in Europe and
[SPEAKER_01]: other parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please take away that prejudice that
cannabis that is cheaper is poor quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is completely mistaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can invite you to my growing facilities
in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see my facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are completely IMC, GACP,
certified, CEO of GNC, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel market, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to do a better close up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now my question is why don't we take
such opportunities to put this into a
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation, you know, from you again,
as I said before, you guys are here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation making.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you put this up and try to bring
it into consideration?
[SPEAKER_01]: And just try to accommodate a foreign
company that is doing a good job into your
[SPEAKER_01]: needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I take that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first of all, thanks for your view on
quality and price.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also like to comment on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But regarding your question, not only us,
but many others in the industry lobbied
[SPEAKER_03]: probably the last 24 months or 18 months
for global supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of us did so.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we need to accept right now that the
regulator and the legislator is not in
[SPEAKER_03]: favor of that at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not that I don't want to fight,
I don't want to continue the fight,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I also have to choose the right fights
that I want to have, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now we're very close to have a
draft bill that might be presented to the
[SPEAKER_03]: parliament and this is huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is huge for us as industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is huge for Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is huge for Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe going down this route,
even if it means we need to start with a
[SPEAKER_03]: non-commercial home-grow and cannabis club
set up with only locally produced
[SPEAKER_03]: home-grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I take that if it helps us to come
to the next step where we have a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: medical commercially addressable market
which you could serve with your
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I believe it's very important that you
need to understand we tried to lobby into
[SPEAKER_03]: this direction, but we also need to accept
that doing the right thing now is more
[SPEAKER_03]: important for all of us for the industry
than optimizing in the very, very short
[SPEAKER_03]: term on a specific singular question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my view here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with regards to quality and price,
I agree, yeah, there can be cheap product
[SPEAKER_03]: at great quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely need to differentiate is it
indoor grown?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the microbiome?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the bud size?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like all those things that we consider as
a high quality product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there is a cultivator in a low cost
country that can produce those products in
[SPEAKER_03]: high quality, yeah, they have probably the
great things that should come to the
[SPEAKER_03]: German market.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to make one more comment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think the potential size of the
medical market cannot be underestimated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reality is that in Switzerland,
for example, today when we're speaking
[SPEAKER_05]: about the medical market, there's been
some estimates where the federal office of
[SPEAKER_05]: public health says that maybe there's
500,000 people consuming cannabis or three
[SPEAKER_05]: to 400,000 people consuming cannabis on a
regular basis out of eight, nine million
[SPEAKER_05]: population.
[SPEAKER_05]: And 100,000 of these patients are
self-medicating patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it doesn't take into account,
for example, 5% of the Swiss population,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's not an official, that's just an
unofficial estimates that are consuming
[SPEAKER_05]: opioids on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of these patients could, for example,
they could hugely benefit from
[SPEAKER_05]: substituting opioids with medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just in absolute terms,
that's not in relative terms, that's the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole Swiss population 5%, so the adult
population probably even higher.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much potential there still that
we haven't been able to explore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in that market, cross border trade is
absolutely open.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something we really have to keep
in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to remind people, in the
interest of time, because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: have questions, let's try to get to the
question quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't always need the whole history
behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so quick summary.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are a GMP producer in Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: We pay very close attention to what's
going on in the Spanish market,
[SPEAKER_04]: where they have, and the government has a
subcommittee.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've asked the regulatory body to
produce guidance, but it's been slow
[SPEAKER_04]: moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is, are you aware,
we've talked a lot about Germany,
[SPEAKER_04]: are you aware of or can you highlight
other countries where maybe it's moved
[SPEAKER_04]: beyond public advocacy to actual
deliberation in governments that could be
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the next markets in Europe?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a special interest should have
France.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're finishing their pilot in
2024.
[SPEAKER_06]: And due to the sheer size of their
population, they actually have the
[SPEAKER_06]: potential of being at least the second
biggest market in Europe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Furthermore, we, as a company,
are looking at UK, Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_06]: and Poland.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, Poland is a little bit more
tricky in terms of regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, so there's multiple countries
that actually are gaining traction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I was hearing Daniel saying that
the definition of other products like
[SPEAKER_07]: extract could be something that could have
a big importance also in the recreational
[SPEAKER_07]: market.
[SPEAKER_07]: So can you please elaborate, maybe also,
Konstantin, what's your view on the idea
[SPEAKER_07]: that there is at the moment a threshold
for THC potency while eventually the best
[SPEAKER_07]: approach would be to regulate more on the
quantity, and therefore extract that could
[SPEAKER_07]: be in concentrated form could eventually
be a favorite in that regard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think in the medical market,
extracts will be a winner midterm for
[SPEAKER_09]: sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: All the doctors we talked to, I would say
80% prefer extract over flour.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just have to come up with a stable
formulation, a good product that can be
[SPEAKER_09]: delivered sustainably.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_09]: On the recreational cannabis market,
I'm a little more skeptical because if you
[SPEAKER_09]: look at the consumers' reaction,
I think in behavior, they prefer the
[SPEAKER_09]: flour.
[SPEAKER_09]: They like edibles and other form factors,
but not so much extracts as they are
[SPEAKER_09]: applied in the medicinal market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And edibles and so on, that won't be
allowed in the near future.
[SPEAKER_09]: And even with extracts, I'm kind of
skeptical that this will be allowed.
[SPEAKER_09]: It would require another level of
education towards the regulator,
[SPEAKER_09]: and we'll be happy if we have educated
them enough on flours so that they will
[SPEAKER_09]: allow that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So more skeptical about the recreational
market, definitely a winner midterm in the
[SPEAKER_09]: medical market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe let me add some figures on the
extracts market right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The total medical cannabis market is like
60% flours, around about 20% extracts,
[SPEAKER_03]: another 20% isolates, which is dronobinol
mainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see that the flours market is super
patient driven.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, again, a lot of self payers in
that market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some say 30%, others say 80%.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the extracts is pretty much doctors
driven, and at the same time, once you
[SPEAKER_03]: have a patient that uses a certain
extract, you see that the quote or that it
[SPEAKER_03]: is re-prescribed is very high compared to
the flours market where we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: switching patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from like a pure revenue perspective,
as a company that offers those products,
[SPEAKER_03]: yes, I totally agree, extracts,
it's pretty interesting, especially when a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of maybe patient driven people in like
really the future might go out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: medical market because they go for home
growing or get another adult use product
[SPEAKER_03]: to substitute that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a very relevant category,
which is at the moment pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: underestimated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, you shouldn't underestimate the
fact that most, for example, neuropathic
[SPEAKER_05]: pain patients are in a multi-medication
setup.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just a single, you don't
substitute five medications with medical
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You continue to take various medication
plus cannabis, and it's so much easier to
[SPEAKER_05]: titrate extracts than having someone
inhale or even smoke a bud.
All
[SPEAKER_00]: right, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a producer in Argentina and also in
Colombia, and this last point is really
[SPEAKER_00]: what my main interest is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys are aware,
but Argentina has a brand new cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: law, industrial cannabis law on the table
for the president to sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my company did a lot of lobbying into
that new law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we're going to
see very soon is a new threshold of THC on
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the countries in South America
are gonna allow 1% THC as a threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, Argentina in particular,
which is a very large agriculture country,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of experience in large agro
operations, we are going to allow up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.5% with lab remediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go over the threshold,
you can go to an extraction lab and just
[SPEAKER_00]: produce an extract from biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my question, because I'm an investor
also, and we're trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: whether we should be setting up a GMP
flower drying facility or just a lab for
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, what do you think is gonna
happen to this market when good quality
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts will come from at a price of what
happened in the US with CBD that used to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a couple thousand dollars a kilogram,
and today it's only $300.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a place in this market for
extracts that are cheap?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's gonna happen to the flower
market if you can buy a gram of extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: 98% THC, for the same price as a gram of
flowers?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it highly depends on the market
segment.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you talk about medical extracts,
you always need a doctor to prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a foreign company, you should
probably have some local partner that
[SPEAKER_06]: actually has a network that is able to
educate and talk to doctors.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you import flower, I don't think that
it works just to put a flower damn cheap
[SPEAKER_06]: on the German market and it will be sold
instantly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it is not that easy anymore in the
German market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Benedict, how do you see this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, maybe just one remark here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you've mentioned is already in a
smaller scale reality in the market,
[SPEAKER_03]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have flowers, I know 500, 400 different
products in the market, or 200,
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't know already, although we
have all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The extracts, we have a lot of different
suppliers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have one that is very much leading the
whole segment with over 50% market share,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we have already pretty low-cost
full-spectrum extracts available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the same time, we also have
dronabinol isolates, so to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: also available in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we already see that a patient and a
doctor would have a choice of prescribing
[SPEAKER_03]: a gram of flower or a equivalent of
extract, dronabinol, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end, it's at the moment very
much patient-focused thing, what helps the
[SPEAKER_03]: patient best, what's the right application
form, what is also maybe the need that the
[SPEAKER_03]: patient has, and right now it ends up at
the split that I've mentioned,
[SPEAKER_03]: 60-20-20.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is the only medicine that people
really enjoy the side effects.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: One last brief comment.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear a lot of people from... And
applause to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: One last comment.
[SPEAKER_09]: If the entire world wants to cultivate for
Germany, we will have an oversupply,
[SPEAKER_09]: even in Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only 80 million, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be the largest cannabis market,
but not large enough for the entire world.
[SPEAKER_09]: So please, guys, also work with your
governments, with your regulators.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to see it open up in... Nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to see it open up in Colombia,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's make this a global cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are actually over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it again for the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very fantastic.
Thank you.
