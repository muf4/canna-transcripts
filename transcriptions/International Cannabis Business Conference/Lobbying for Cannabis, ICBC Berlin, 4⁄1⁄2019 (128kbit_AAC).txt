[SPEAKER_04]: So just before I introduce our panelists,
I just kind of want to thank ICBC again
[SPEAKER_04]: for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: These conferences just seem to get better
every single year, and Alex and his team
[SPEAKER_04]: do a really great job.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my first panelist is George Wirth.
[SPEAKER_04]: He should be fairly well known in German
cannabis circles.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the leader of the German hemp
association Deutsch-Hampferbrand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew I was going to scream that up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deutsch-Hampferbrand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's been leading it since its
founding in 2000.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's also a former local politician with
the Green Party.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please welcome George Wirth.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit down from here, we have
Burkhard Beinart.
[SPEAKER_04]: He should also be well known to Germans in
the audience, as he was a member of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Bundestag until 2017 as a social democrat.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was also that Burt's drug policy
spokesperson.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, please say hello to Burkhard
Beinart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, we have Susan Chappelle.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's very well known to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's been a patient advocate for over a
decade.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's currently the government relations
director with Pascha Brands, and she's
[SPEAKER_04]: also a former city councillor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please say good and talk to Susan
Chappelle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last, but certainly not least,
is Clint Young.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clint's start in the industry was in the
Vancouver dispensary scene, much like
[SPEAKER_04]: myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: He went on to become CEO of MMJ Canada in
2015, which was a company that was based
[SPEAKER_04]: both in BC and in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's currently, well, he's still with
a lot of us organization as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: which we'll get into a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's now with company X based out of
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please welcome Clint Young.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got a little bit of a longer
introduction than normal too, because
[SPEAKER_04]: lobbying for cannabis is a really weird
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: When most people think of lobbying,
you think you're gonna have to try and
[SPEAKER_04]: convince a politician to do something
that's probably not gonna make the
[SPEAKER_04]: government a lot of money, and probably
not gonna make people feel better.
[SPEAKER_04]: People think of big pharma, they think of
big tobacco when they think of lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with cannabis, it's sort of the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're trying to convince a politician to
do something that will help a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people and make the government a lot of
money, and they still don't actually want
[SPEAKER_04]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like arguing with a
two-year-old, or that expression about
[SPEAKER_04]: playing chess with a pigeon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't really matter if you win,
they're still gonna knock over all the
[SPEAKER_04]: pieces and shit all over the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: As this panel is very kind of heavily
Canadian and German, we're gonna kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: go through very quickly the lobbying
challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And issues that we had in Canada going
from fully illegal to fully legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll kind of delve into where we
are in Germany, and what the specific
[SPEAKER_04]: issues are here, and how we move forward
from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my own background was in lobbying a
federal government that absolutely hated
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I then tried to lobby a provincial
government that didn't really care one way
[SPEAKER_04]: or another.
[SPEAKER_04]: I then found some city governments that
absolutely hated the federal government.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were actually willing to give some
licenses to illegal businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: That worked out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because within six months, that government
was no longer in power, and we had the
[SPEAKER_04]: Canadian liberals who had run on a policy
of legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that point, distribution was given to
provinces, and so different provinces were
[SPEAKER_04]: taking different approaches.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Ontario, they decided they wanted to
run all of the stores themselves,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they were just gonna shut down all of
the existing privately run retailers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is why I went to work with MMJ.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started lobbying in Ontario,
and now Ontario does have private retail,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it also sort of resulted in a
government getting kicked out in order to
[SPEAKER_04]: do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Clint, you wanna kind of tell that
story?
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for having me,
guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so Ontario, Canada, although MMJ
Canada was based Canada east to west in
[SPEAKER_11]: Vancouver, Nelson, DC, and in Ontario,
it was really tricky in Ontario,
[SPEAKER_11]: because Jamie had said the structure and
the format was kind of already in place
[SPEAKER_11]: due to the due diligence of people like
Jamie in Vancouver and in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it seemed as we opened up MMJ Canada's
in Ontario, the government was right in
[SPEAKER_11]: the middle of an election, and a lady
named Kathleen Wynne, who was the premier
[SPEAKER_11]: of Ontario at the time, wanted to put it
in LCBOs, which is government-run liquor
[SPEAKER_11]: distribution store style model.
[SPEAKER_11]: They wanted to call it the OCS,
or pardon me, the CCBO at one point.
[SPEAKER_11]: They then changed it to the OCS.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then as power changed, it went from
the liberal party to the conservative
[SPEAKER_11]: party, where then Doug Ford said he wanted
to privatize and have an open and free
[SPEAKER_11]: market, which at the end of all said and
done, that never even happened either,
[SPEAKER_11]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_11]: They ended up with 25 licenses and certain
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in the very beginning of MMJ Canada,
which I've been speaking here now,
[SPEAKER_11]: this is my third year, if anybody was here
before, we were a gray market entity,
[SPEAKER_11]: medical cannabis dispensary.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I spent a lot of my time dealing with
police raids, conflict resolution,
[SPEAKER_11]: and I realized that no matter how much of
a standard that you set for a government
[SPEAKER_11]: or a brand, you are going to be painted as
the same brush when you're in the illegal,
[SPEAKER_11]: in the listed market.
[SPEAKER_11]: I then started lobbying municipalities,
and I asked Jamie to fly in because she
[SPEAKER_11]: was my government relations director at
the time, and I was struggling with a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: of the aspects of Ontario, and it was
becoming frustrating.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Jamie kind of came out to fly out with
me and work with the city agency.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hamilton, which is my hometown,
and we started lobbying the city
[SPEAKER_11]: councillors and speaking in front of
different city, pardon me, the city,
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah, the city regulators, and it got to
the point where we were actually making a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot of headway with the city
municipalities, and at one point I was
[SPEAKER_11]: like, wow, Hamilton's going to give us
temporary licenses, and this is really
[SPEAKER_11]: neat, and we might be the first city
besides Vancouver ahead of the time for
[SPEAKER_11]: Ontario that might produce these licenses.
[SPEAKER_11]: But unfortunately, as I realize now,
which is a mistake that I made as the CEO
[SPEAKER_11]: of MMJ Canada, was that I was lobbying the
wrong people.
[SPEAKER_11]: As much as the municipalities had saved,
as Jamie said, there was one municipality
[SPEAKER_11]: in all of Canada that decided to really
essentially allow these licenses to happen
[SPEAKER_11]: before legalization, or certain jurors
did.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a few.
[SPEAKER_11]: A few, yeah, very minor.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ontario, there was none at the time,
and I really thought I was going to break
[SPEAKER_11]: ground with Hamilton, and then the
province came in and they literally just
[SPEAKER_11]: squashed it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The issues that I had and I realized was
that I might have been lobbying the wrong
[SPEAKER_11]: people.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel that you need to include,
well, in Canada it goes municipality,
[SPEAKER_11]: provinces, and then federal.
[SPEAKER_11]: I realize now that if I was to have to
redo it again, which I will never redo it
[SPEAKER_11]: again, but if I had to, I would start with
the province and the federal, and then
[SPEAKER_11]: work down to the municipality,
because there's only so much the
[SPEAKER_11]: municipalities can do.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would do it again, because I'm a sucker
for punishment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to BC, we had some cities that were
on the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a province that was fairly
progressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had federal legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: We succeeded in getting smaller licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: We succeeded in getting edibles and
topicals coming, which were all major
[SPEAKER_04]: issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then as we moved forward, we found that
all of the issues came back down to the
[SPEAKER_04]: cities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, Susan, you were a councillor in
Squamish, which was a small town in a
[SPEAKER_04]: progressive province.
[SPEAKER_04]: Under legalizations, what kind of
challenges came next and what are we doing
[SPEAKER_04]: now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Jamie.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Municipalities in British Columbia have no
access to taxation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting that Clint spoke
about the multiple levels of government,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think is pretty much global.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have different regulations coming down
from the feds and different regulations at
[SPEAKER_01]: the province.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had basically split the taxes between
the province and the feds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The municipalities have no access to
taxation from cannabis, yet they are the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that are dealing with police,
bylaws, land use struggles, allowing land
[SPEAKER_01]: use for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a city councillor, I recognize I was a
closeted cannabis user because I was a
[SPEAKER_01]: politician, but I had to become an
advocate for the industry because we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: massive industry in Squamish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much of our economy came from it,
even though we couldn't prove it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work in a clinic that deals with cancer
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: My patients were driving down the highway
to access their medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had no dispensary laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't licensing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew legalization was coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, this is a giant policy hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no access to cannabis for
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have no land use for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize how big cultivation was
because I hadn't really entered as an
[SPEAKER_01]: advocate for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started writing bylaws.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because much of my bylaw work
was based on Jamie, before we had even
[SPEAKER_01]: met, based on the work that Jamie and
Clint had done in other regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started writing bylaws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of going through staff and saying,
this has to happen and can you please
[SPEAKER_01]: write something, I just presented the
bylaw and in two weeks we voted on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't any education and it wasn't
legal yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to pass it two more times.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to pass it the third time,
I had to change the regulations to be
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty prohibitive for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put in numbers that weren't based on
any science or facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were based on federal regulations in
the United States for 200 meter setbacks
[SPEAKER_01]: for any cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were a dispensary or a cultivator
or any sort of extraction business,
[SPEAKER_01]: you had to be 200 meters from other
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're 12 kilometers long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could basically have five cannabis
businesses and all of those licenses got
[SPEAKER_01]: taken up with dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have a massive illegal business
and we still have no taxation in British
[SPEAKER_01]: Columbia and in all the municipalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: The work that I've started to focus on
now, as I ran for mayor and I failed to
[SPEAKER_01]: get into as mayor because we also have
populist politics in Canada now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lobbying for cannabis afterwards became my
passion because access to full botanicals,
[SPEAKER_01]: access to the plant, I also work in
science, so access to the plant for
[SPEAKER_01]: medical research and understanding what a
full spectrum botanical does is incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: important for many reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lobbying the province has become so that
we can actually have a tax share in
[SPEAKER_01]: municipalities and be able to pay for our
RCP and our bylaws and so that
[SPEAKER_01]: municipalities feel like they have some
skin in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not gaining any resources,
there's no reason to move forward with
[SPEAKER_01]: policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking to politicians and explaining the
economic benefits, I've tried to build
[SPEAKER_01]: some economic models.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried to explain the importance of
modeling the economics of it and not just
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about patients and medicine
because for me, it's recreation and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: equally as important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's medical but not just medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely, and all of these pieces fit
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have legal hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have legal medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have legal recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got edibles and topicals coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the smaller licenses that we've
been wanting and now we're fighting to be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to grow good cannabis, organic
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're fighting to be able to actually grow
an agricultural product on agricultural
[SPEAKER_04]: land.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the issues where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Burkhard, some of this pattern seems
probably pretty familiar to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of your main objectives when you were
in the Senate was to give cost-free access
[SPEAKER_04]: to patients to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were pretty successful at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You removed some of the bureaucracy that
was involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada invented healthcare and we still
tax medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still not doing it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What were the challenges for you to even
get to that point and how were you
[SPEAKER_04]: successful and what are the outstanding
issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do this from the point of view of
the politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your introduction, Jenge has drawn the
picture of how politicians actually work
[SPEAKER_00]: and how they react when they are being
whispered from the outside as if something
[SPEAKER_00]: has happened or has not happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way in Germany is completely
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to find our own way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was completely different than the way
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we've been talking about cannabis
in this political debate for 25-30 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it makes sense to legalize
cannabis, I can remember my own party,
[SPEAKER_00]: which made a decision in the mid-90s,
and that's the condition for a politician
[SPEAKER_00]: that something comes into motion,
that we have a majority for a path that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can then take.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing has fallen asleep,
more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to put the chess game back on the
ground of the realities of politics,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the target that comes into play has
been sacrificed, and then you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: re-establish the playing field,
the chess game, so that you can set the
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate positions well again and get
something in return.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the question of cannabis
as medicine, I think we put value on it in
[SPEAKER_00]: politics, that we separate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there was the opportunity to open a
door, to put the jumper well on the
[SPEAKER_00]: playing field, we had to make sure that it
was not mixed with a complete debate about
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization of cannabis, but what we
wanted to achieve was actually to enable
[SPEAKER_00]: people, patients, to take this path,
and that on a possible good path,
[SPEAKER_00]: that costs are taken over by the
legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That worked, that was good, that we
separated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it makes sense to have gone
forward in this medical area, to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: look at it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not have a political majority in
Germany to take this legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will of course also have to lead a
debate in the future, how we deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization of cannabis, how we organize
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we look towards
Canada or other states that have made
[SPEAKER_00]: their way to find and look for models,
how it can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's why it makes sense how
we did it, to have the success with the
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative candidates, who were
politically under pressure to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: solution for the medical approach of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have to stay on the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the right thing, the necessary
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm no longer a parliamentarian in
between, I'm trying to control it
[SPEAKER_00]: politically, so that we can talk about
these models, what is possible and what
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a meaningful path in Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a good way to look at
both sides of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good story.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, regarding the issue of the
commune, I would have a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different approach at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in Germany they have a completely
different meaning, in fact, to help us as
[SPEAKER_00]: a door opener to get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and that's been my experience as
well, and kind of had success by working
[SPEAKER_04]: with the smaller governments that,
as Susan said, are gonna end up having to
[SPEAKER_04]: deal with most of these issues anyway,
and they're the ones spending the
[SPEAKER_04]: resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: George, you've also been involved in this
fight for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of the biggest issues for
you right now, and what are some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: tactics that George Hanford-Brandt uses to
actually try and make change?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, about the tactics, accidentally I
Googled the word lobbyism last week by
[SPEAKER_02]: another reason, not because of this panel
here, and lobbyism means make political
[SPEAKER_02]: contacts to get something through,
get something decided on, for others,
[SPEAKER_02]: for association of people, for network of
people, somehow, whatever network that is,
[SPEAKER_02]: political contacts, but also public
relations work to convince people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the time since 2002, since German kind
of association exists, that were my main
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the public relations thing is,
in one part, over our own channels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have the strongest social media
channels at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say I've found no other NGO in the
scene, or in the scene international,
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever, as strong as we are every
week pushing out reaching people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that made us really strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time when there's something to take
action, when we call for action,
[SPEAKER_02]: every time we were very successful,
for example, 2017, we had the strongest
[SPEAKER_02]: petition in the Bundestag of the year
calling for legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can mention lots of other things
like that, where we were really on the
[SPEAKER_02]: forefront when it was about asking people
for something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see more and more people in the public
opinion favoring legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we started, when the first poll I
have in mind is 2010, it was 19% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: public in favor of legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since 2014, we make it every year,
ask the people in a representative poll,
[SPEAKER_02]: and 2013, 2014, it was 30%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, it was 46%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are arriving slowly at the majority,
and that is something we need to convince
[SPEAKER_02]: politicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we heard before, we don't have the
majority to get it right through now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, I think that's okay, because that's
part of the democratic game, somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't think politicians should do the
right thing just because it's the right
[SPEAKER_02]: thing when the people don't want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to have that majority,
and we soon will have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, the same thing is when you ask
the politicians, when you look into the
[SPEAKER_02]: parliaments, when I started doing black
policy end of the 90s, only the Green
[SPEAKER_02]: Party was for legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the Left Party came in the boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the liberals came in the boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the social democrats, I hope,
are soon in the boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Burkhardt is one of the guys leading the
way to that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, everything comes
together, and the nice day will come to
[SPEAKER_02]: legalize also in Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, and it takes education,
it takes constant effort, and it takes
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking outside of the box.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the kind of more interesting
things that you've done that are not maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: typical in other jurisdictions is you win
a million euros on a TV show and turn that
[SPEAKER_04]: into Europe's first cinematic
anti-prohibition campaign.
[SPEAKER_04]: You also won a poll to be able to talk to
Angela Merkel.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that go, and what did you say to
her?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was actually two times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little bit, I think,
[SPEAKER_02]: an Obama idea when he tried to get contact
to the public over the internet,
[SPEAKER_02]: the internet community asking questions,
and the best-voted questions he would
[SPEAKER_02]: answer or do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something Merkel tried also.
[SPEAKER_02]: First thing was via YouTube, ask me
questions, the 10 most-voted questions I
[SPEAKER_02]: will answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we asked, why don't we legalize
marijuana?
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of 6,000 questions, this was
number one, and she had to answer it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer was, well, not very
informed, like, well, we can't legalize it
[SPEAKER_02]: because of cultural reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alcohol is our culture, not cannabis,
and cannabis is very highly addictive,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she tried it with her own
platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not questions this time, but suggestions.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said, what was good for the future of
Germany?
[SPEAKER_02]: The 10 best-voted suggestions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will here personally invite you in my
office, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were on place two out of 11,000
suggestions, and so I was first cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: lobbyist talking to the German chancellor,
and at least I convinced her to call for
[SPEAKER_02]: an expert panel and said, well,
your answers out of the first round were
[SPEAKER_02]: very bad informed, so please ask some
experts, and at least that she really did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and I mean, this is, you know,
there's a lot of moving pieces to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Merkel had mentioned earlier
that there was initiatives in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Canada tried to legalize in the 70s,
and the United States went, no,
[SPEAKER_04]: no, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you went, oh, okay, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then nothing again until 10 years of
courts saying you have to fix this,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the government doing the worst
possible job on purpose because they
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't want it fixed, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Burkhart, you, again, so this kills me a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada is, one of the things that we're
very proud of is that we're a country that
[SPEAKER_04]: invented national healthcare.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we've had legal medical cannabis for
over a decade, we still don't cover it the
[SPEAKER_04]: way we cover other medications.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually tax it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've added more tax onto it that now
medical patients have to pay, and they
[SPEAKER_04]: can't get back, which is not in line at
all with Canadian culture when you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: talk about traditional cultures and
values.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was, again, a main focus of your
work, and you were very successful,
[SPEAKER_04]: but as we've discovered with everything
else, it's never really done.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are the other specific issues that
you feel around medical cannabis in
[SPEAKER_04]: particular that really need to be
addressed here in Germany?
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the question of how it's going on
in Germany with medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're actually standing with a
good law, with a good foundation,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, in front of enormous problems and
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm currently seeing from the
outside, how it's being dealt with in
[SPEAKER_00]: politics at the moment, they're docking on
small solutions, but in the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: the problems that arise with the
introduction of the new law anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that there are problems,
but it's dramatic that you're not working
[SPEAKER_00]: on a solution to make it better now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could have taken the
necessary steps to show politically that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're behind this law, and that we're
supporting this law, because in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: of the patients, it's still undone and
still has disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, the patient orientation in
this law is actually the central building
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks and components, and that would
actually be the chance to represent
[SPEAKER_00]: oneself as the one who is also the lawyer
for the patient rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm actually missing in
the current politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're allowed to do that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would actually like to make a bow to
legalization of cannabis now, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary, because we're losing time again
through this debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the UNGASS conference in New
York, and it's actually necessary to say
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have the national drug policy,
or the national cannabis policy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if we can't do it in Europe,
and if we can't do it on the international
[SPEAKER_00]: level, over the gremies that are there,
to lay the necessary building blocks so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can get a legalization in other
countries, and get the relief regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: export and import, and regarding the
expansion of other products, then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow stuck and stuck, and we're not
actually in the sense of the people on the
[SPEAKER_00]: road as politicians, in order to find a
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for all national solutions
at the moment, and we have to harmonize
[SPEAKER_00]: them in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this international question is
actually, from a political point of view,
[SPEAKER_00]: also for the Federal Republic of Germany,
one of the important building blocks that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me very happy to hear that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in Canada and most other
jurisdictions that we've seen,
[SPEAKER_04]: medical has been thrown under the bus.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not trying to fix medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are no politicians standing up for
medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully you guys get that right,
so that we can look to you and go,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, that's how we fix our system.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the other interesting thing that I
find about cannabis, is every jurisdiction
[SPEAKER_04]: that you go to says, well, we're
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not like that other jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're loose, and we're not.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're very strict.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you actually look at all the
jurisdictions, they end up following the
[SPEAKER_04]: same pattern, how it plays out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's sometimes a little bit a different
hue in the shade, but it all ends up being
[SPEAKER_04]: the same pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it may take 10 years to take one
step.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes that step will happen in a
month, but it ends up sort of following
[SPEAKER_04]: the same pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things, one of the reasons
why I love ICBC and coming to conferences
[SPEAKER_04]: around the world is that when Vancouver
decided to license illegal businesses,
[SPEAKER_04]: they didn't do it in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had prepared a report for them and
showed them what happened in California
[SPEAKER_04]: cities.
[SPEAKER_04]: When a city decided that they were going
to regulate cannabis for the benefit of
[SPEAKER_04]: patients and for the benefit of their
communities, they had really good rules
[SPEAKER_04]: that worked just fine until the states
came along and screwed them up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the states would kind of come
along and screw them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you'd compare that to other cities
that were trying to fight it, and we were
[SPEAKER_04]: discussing this in the green room a little
bit, George, about how they, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the more that prohibition is trying to
actually clamp down on it, the worse it
[SPEAKER_04]: actually gets.
[SPEAKER_04]: For everybody, it becomes a little bit
more of a Wild West scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: It becomes harder to track things down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from just a public health perspective,
it makes a lot more sense to have brick
[SPEAKER_04]: and mortar locations where you can go and
look, or to have testing regulations
[SPEAKER_04]: around cannabis or how you can grow it,
but to not go too far with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: George, where do you think we are next?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think the next fight is here
in Germany?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how is that going to be affected by or
affect the nations around you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there are a lot of things we have to
care about at the moment, some very
[SPEAKER_02]: concrete problems on the medical base.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that everybody gets his
reimbursement for medicine, even if you
[SPEAKER_02]: have a recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: About one third of the proposals are taken
by the health insurances.
[SPEAKER_02]: The prices are very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: For one gram, it's more than 20 euros per
gram in German pharmacies, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: German bureaucratic or trip somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not easy to get rid of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the shortage problems and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are many details we are fighting
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also things about the criminalization
of consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The driver's license issue is a very big
one in Germany because here a lot of sober
[SPEAKER_02]: people lose their driver's license because
we have here the limit of one nanogram THC
[SPEAKER_02]: per milliliter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is very, very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I'm ever under that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never driving ever in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never be behind a wheel in Germany
ever then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how fast we come forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a big issue for us to push.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the criminalization as such.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year we have a new record.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like we are coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going forward in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the repression is still rising.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's also an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we have a majority in the
parliament soon about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little step, not as far as
legalization, but when we say,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, if you have got 10 gram,
well, if people alone or take it as a,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do the Americans say, misnima or
something, like just a pale line and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's it and no record and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we come further on that front.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Burkhard said, the cities do play a
big role in Germany because here the
[SPEAKER_02]: German drug law, we have, well,
it's not a loophole.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an idea that scientific model
projects are possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how Germany tested 10 years ago
or 15 years ago, the distribution of
[SPEAKER_02]: heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was very successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now doctors can prescribe heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the same idea for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I said, we come closer to
majorities also in the political field,
[SPEAKER_02]: we see now majorities in cities,
the first little parliaments who have
[SPEAKER_02]: majorities calling for legalization,
but not yet in the Bundestag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might be the right tool to bring
power from bottom down, like grassroot
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, like in the States or Vancouver
story.
[SPEAKER_04]: It always is.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cannabis, no matter what jurisdiction
you look at, it came from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's when suddenly people at the top
go, okay, we're gonna make the rules that
[SPEAKER_04]: everything starts kind of going sideways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Clint, you're in Switzerland now.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of the challenges that are
gonna be there and how does what
[SPEAKER_04]: Switzerland does affect what goes on in
the rest of Europe?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, in Switzerland, it seems to be a
little easier for manufacturing industrial
[SPEAKER_11]: hemp CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: As of right now, you're free to grow and
manufacture hemp CBD as long as it's under
[SPEAKER_11]: 1%.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've noticed that our one partner Tobias
Jenny, who is unfortunately in Tel Aviv
[SPEAKER_11]: right now, he is the founder of the
Medical Cannabis Association in
[SPEAKER_11]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's been working with the state and
the different politicians.
[SPEAKER_11]: And from my understanding, Tobias has
explained to me very well that they're a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot more communicative than cannabis was.
[SPEAKER_11]: There hasn't seen as many, as near as many
issues as I went through being a
[SPEAKER_11]: completely gray market entity.
[SPEAKER_11]: The way it's viewed in Switzerland,
regulated, so it's a lot more easier on us
[SPEAKER_11]: to operate and to work with the
government.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of excited to see what happens
with Switzerland and the THC testing in
[SPEAKER_11]: the next few months and years to come.
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, it's a lot easier than what was
happening in Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to touch back on what Susan was
saying, the municipalities didn't may have
[SPEAKER_11]: any money coming in for taxes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was one of the things that really
frustrated me the most in Canada when I
[SPEAKER_11]: was working with it, that you have these
people that want these councillors and the
[SPEAKER_11]: municipalities to help.
[SPEAKER_11]: But as also a councillor, you need city
tax money coming in to grow
[SPEAKER_11]: infrastructure, roads, education,
harm reduction sites.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when there's nothing coming in for
them, it makes it really hard for them to
[SPEAKER_11]: step on your side for lobbying,
especially in parts of Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: Each province is extremely different where
some are really proactive.
[SPEAKER_11]: And some aren't, and Ontario at the time
really wasn't, although my city of
[SPEAKER_11]: Hamilton was.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really wish there was more people like
Susan who, from a councillor's point of
[SPEAKER_11]: view, although she knew that there has to
be tax coming in and a benefit for the
[SPEAKER_11]: city for it to make sense, she played a
major role in advocacy and so did Jamie.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I've noticed in Canada,
which is actually kind of impressive,
[SPEAKER_11]: some of the best lobbyists in Canada,
and it should be talked about a little
[SPEAKER_11]: more, or females, and they're really good
at what they do.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's councillors like Susan,
it's people like Jamie, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_11]: the lobbying aspects that I've looked up
to for a long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Lobbying is not my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a reason why I brought Jamie in
to Ontario to help with me, because I'm
[SPEAKER_11]: somebody that wears my heart on my sleeve.
[SPEAKER_11]: I speak about mental health and cannabis a
lot more than I do anything else.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm quite passionate and I'm very
vulnerable to getting defensive and kind
[SPEAKER_11]: of coming across with a little bit of
fire.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I wanted to do what I wanted to do
in Ontario, I knew that I had to reach out
[SPEAKER_11]: to someone and you hear a lot about the
power corps and the men and strong men and
[SPEAKER_11]: all that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I always reach out to the females.
[SPEAKER_11]: I felt like the females have been doing
the strongest in lobbying in all of Canada
[SPEAKER_11]: and making the most effect.
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I'm super thankful for people
like Susan, Hilary Black, Jamie Shaw,
[SPEAKER_11]: all these people doing things.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they should be given the credit they
deserve because they're the ones leading
[SPEAKER_11]: the forefront for this.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually dispersed that our parliament
had more politicians like Burkhart that
[SPEAKER_04]: actually cared about patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, this is an issue that we've
seen everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington says, well, we've got medical
program, but you're not really allowed to
[SPEAKER_04]: sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of these businesses pop up and
they're illegal and they're selling only
[SPEAKER_04]: to people that the state says is allowed
to have cannabis, but they're not allowed
[SPEAKER_04]: to sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they suddenly go, okay,
you know what, we're gonna do recreational
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of those now medical ones are now
illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, that's sort of a pattern that
we keep seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope we definitely do not see that in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: Burkhart, what's your take on how what
Germany does affects what goes on around
[SPEAKER_04]: it?
[SPEAKER_04]: If Luxembourg legalizes, is that gonna
have an effect on Germany in any way?
[SPEAKER_04]: A little plug to Luxembourg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it does have a meaning,
whether it's Luxembourg or France,
[SPEAKER_00]: if a European country actually brought
this debate into the European debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, of course, attempts or
initiatives in Portugal and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's politics in motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who stands still does not bring
anything forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to move to go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I hope that in Germany,
too, from outside, the suggestions are
[SPEAKER_00]: also taken up and in politics too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, in this respect, all the best
for those who are now bravely making their
[SPEAKER_00]: way around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have to move on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, and for me, I love the
different jurisdictions doing different
[SPEAKER_04]: things, because that's how you can sort of
see, hey, this does work or this doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: work.
[SPEAKER_04]: If everybody does the same thing,
it takes a lot longer to kind of get
[SPEAKER_04]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Susan, I'll kind of leave with you just
before we go to a quick Q&A.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your thoughts on what comes next
in terms of global lobbying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel that we need to focus on
more of the vertical integration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just about the cannabis and the
cultivation that politicians need to
[SPEAKER_01]: realize that this is a huge economic
generator for their municipalities,
[SPEAKER_01]: for their provinces, and for their
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: The country that makes it legal across all
of the vertical chain, the ancillary
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses and the economics surrounding
cannabis is enormous.
[SPEAKER_01]: This entering prohibition, you know,
sorry, exiting prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exiting prohibition for any industry,
it's only happened a few times in hundreds
[SPEAKER_01]: of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So products leaving an illegal market into
a legal market, it's massive opportunity,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you all know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Explaining that and modeling it for
politicians and being able to speak the
[SPEAKER_01]: same values as politicians have,
being able to research in advance what the
[SPEAKER_01]: politicians are looking for and being able
to speak to the level that the level of
[SPEAKER_01]: government needs to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it be economic benefits or
medicinal benefits, cultural benefits,
[SPEAKER_01]: financial benefits, it's all really
important and there's so many,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much lobbying to be done and
it's going to take multiple communities
[SPEAKER_01]: and also cannabis users need to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's massive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we could talk literally for hours
about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We covered topics very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Gaio, were there any questions from
the audience?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there is a question or two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it again from the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to assure Clint that you
weren't wrong in lobbying local
[SPEAKER_13]: politicians.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to remember when booze was
illegal, we had all the wet air areas and
[SPEAKER_13]: the dry areas.
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the biggest problems now while we
manage to go after the federal government
[SPEAKER_13]: that control prohibition, the provinces
distribution, it's local governments that
[SPEAKER_13]: decide where your store is going to be and
not and so on.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a big problem in a lot of areas
and also landlord tenants, sorts of
[SPEAKER_13]: things.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you really got to figure out who's in
charge of what in terms of the lobbying to
[SPEAKER_13]: focus.
[SPEAKER_13]: And just like a quick thing about the
impaired driving thing, you all have to
[SPEAKER_13]: remember that, well of course Jamie's
case, she's always over five nanograms,
[SPEAKER_13]: but most of us, if you only smoke once in
a while, it'll stay in your system for 90
[SPEAKER_13]: days.
[SPEAKER_13]: So remember that if they pull you over,
officer, it was three months ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just because this deserves a shout
out, lobbying work is one piece of the
[SPEAKER_04]: puzzle and we would not have been anywhere
near successful if it wasn't for lawyers
[SPEAKER_04]: like John Conroy who fought for 30,
40 years in the courts.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to understand where is
precisely if there is any precision on the
[SPEAKER_15]: real bio of adoption.
[SPEAKER_15]: We heard this morning that there is a
strong education to do for the clinical
[SPEAKER_15]: doctors.
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't know exactly what can this is
doing and they are reluctant to use it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And on the other side, we can see that
there is most probably also an education
[SPEAKER_15]: to do for the politician to push ahead
different new law.
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the other hand, we see that Canada
is quite advanced in such a process.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm wondering if the Canadians doctor are
different from European.
[SPEAKER_15]: I presume that they are not well educated.
[SPEAKER_15]: So probably the question is where to put
the focus on clinician or on politician?
Everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the issues that we're having now is
that some of the strongest blowback is
[SPEAKER_04]: actually coming from medical associations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, there's doctors like Dr. Mark
Ware who have been spearheading this and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's research for a long time and they
can't even convince their peers of stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: that we've got weaves of research on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, it literally it takes its
multiple fronts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a one front war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a full spectrum botanical and
that's not unusual plant that's given as
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a bit of a drug looking for a
disease as well because we haven't had
[SPEAKER_01]: access to do research and yet the
physicians, fair enough, they're being
[SPEAKER_01]: told here's a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what it's good for,
but it seems to cover a lot of bases and
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't know dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know how it's given.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the education for medical practitioners
is massive because there is research now
[SPEAKER_01]: that supports use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, is it smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it baked?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it ingested?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many questions still to unpack
around this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it again for Jamie and the
entire panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: The lobbying
[SPEAKER_03]: discussion in particular is difficult and
there's some issues in this industry that
[SPEAKER_03]: are persistent and have not been solved
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's fair to say that
everybody on this panel believes that in
[SPEAKER_03]: some way, some of the larger industry
issues in part can be solved by technology
[SPEAKER_03]: or at least greatly aided.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to throw this question out
immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: What and where do you think technology of
whatever kind can help to continue
[SPEAKER_03]: revolutionizing this business?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if those of you guys don't know,
like Storz and Bickel is, that's who's
[SPEAKER_03]: sitting next to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to throw it to you quickly
because everybody knows your vape and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're international and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, my name is Jürgen Bickel from Storz
and Bickel.
[SPEAKER_14]: We are producing vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_14]: Our first revolutionizing technology was
in the year 2000 when we brought up the
[SPEAKER_14]: volcano vaporizer on the market.
[SPEAKER_14]: Before that time, you had to smoke it more
or less or to eat it.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was no other viable way.
[SPEAKER_14]: So this was one revolution.
[SPEAKER_14]: What today is very normal.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody knows vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are tons of products out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it became very mainstream.
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe the application form will be in
the future more revolutionizing.
[SPEAKER_14]: We see all this concentration rate
vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_14]: It will go forward in this direction.
[SPEAKER_14]: We see alternatives like capsules,
what you can in chest.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I believe there the technology will go
forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just add a little plug here?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, vaping is seen as like the future,
not just of the cannabis business,
[SPEAKER_03]: but a lot of other medications,
a lot of other kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, yeah, in theory it's possible.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, whatever can.
[SPEAKER_14]: But cannabis is a little bit special
because of this decarboxylation process.
[SPEAKER_14]: THC transformed into THC.
[SPEAKER_14]: There must be other substances still found
what can be viable for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what about the rest of you?
[SPEAKER_03]: So please introduce your firm quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you see technology helping to
revolutionize the business?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it sales?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it tracking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just knowing what you're doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are the things that you guys see
technology revolutionizing the business
[SPEAKER_03]: in?
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: That works.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, my name is Jeff Keen.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the CEO of a company called or a
product called 365 Cannabis, but it's
[SPEAKER_10]: actually based on a Microsoft Dynamics
platform and ERP platform.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the way we feel we're going to help
revolutionize the space is actually taking
[SPEAKER_10]: something that works outside the industry
and bring it in.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're looking at the cannabis industry
like every other industry that's out
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the cannabis industry in markets
like Canada and the U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: started out thinking it was unique in
every sense, but from a business process
[SPEAKER_10]: sense, it's like a lot of other business.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Agra, it's food process
manufacturing, it's distribution,
[SPEAKER_10]: warehousing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: and now starting to be in Canada,
it's retail.
[SPEAKER_10]: So rather than look at it and say,
how do I solve my problems in cannabis for
[SPEAKER_10]: those things, we're bringing a platform
from outside that does all those things
[SPEAKER_10]: and applying it to the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then this term seed to sale that comes
out there in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: and Canada where you're compliant.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do all the right business processes
and you set the system up properly,
[SPEAKER_10]: then you're automatically going to be
compliant and you achieve your seed to
[SPEAKER_10]: sale that you hear so often in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: and Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else have some feedback here or?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, hey, hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Zayda Seti.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the CEO, founder of Greenworks
Consulting.
[SPEAKER_08]: The way that technology has actually
revolutionized the industry in my eyes is
[SPEAKER_08]: that it's helped us scale, it's helped us
automate, it's helped us accelerate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Personally, for me, I'm launching a
software called Odyssey.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's focused on licensing and permitting
for cannabis businesses in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's really accelerated and scaled the
process of being able to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though we can't fully automate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that you can equate it to
something like the TurboTax or LegalZoom
[SPEAKER_08]: of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's focused on a lot of the
pre-license aspects of getting these
[SPEAKER_08]: entrepreneurs licensed, getting them up
and running.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've seen everything, in my 25 years
of doing this, I've seen everything from
[SPEAKER_08]: just these seed to sale tracking inventory
control systems all the way to like
[SPEAKER_08]: robots, AI, drones inside cultivation
facilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: That are spotting things like disease,
pests and controlling these and automating
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're gonna see the same thing when
it comes down to drop shipping medication
[SPEAKER_08]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really interesting to see how
technology is really taking this to the
[SPEAKER_08]: next level.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can't wait, we're really excited to
see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna jump here for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see, and I agree with you,
technology is helping to normalize as well
[SPEAKER_03]: as automate routine processes that have
also in part slowed down this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that fair to say?
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have yet to see some of the best
out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, as we go through this innovation
period, it's almost like a renaissance
[SPEAKER_08]: period of technology.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're seeing more and more and more come
out every single day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And everybody's just really taking it to
the next level.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: So hello, my name is Manny.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the chief product officer and interim
CEO of Namaste Technologies.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're a Canadian company.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're a fully vertically integrated
e-commerce platform.
[SPEAKER_09]: In Canada specifically, we have a sales
only license which essentially forces us
[SPEAKER_09]: to be a pure play, a technology pure play
company.
[SPEAKER_09]: We leverage technology to enable
optimization of the user experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we deliver solutions such as
education, telemedicine applications,
[SPEAKER_09]: the ability to purchase cannabis online,
same day delivery, journaling,
[SPEAKER_09]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can talk about each one of these
technologies or siloed assets separately.
[SPEAKER_09]: But my bias is, and it's going to be very
hyped, is around artificial intelligence.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the things that we're focused
on is to try and understand how we can
[SPEAKER_09]: leverage AI to help people find the right
product for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I actually brought one of our lead
machine learning engineers with me so that
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody can harass them and see I'm not
just making stuff up.
[SPEAKER_09]: But just like the fintech industry was
really changed where you have people who
[SPEAKER_09]: are very, very passionate about what
they're doing and understanding regulation
[SPEAKER_09]: and using technology to change that
industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we still see that impact since 2009
until today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fintech is still changing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Literally we're in the infancy days of
technology and cannabis combined.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, MedPay, for those of you who
don't know what it is, it's not meant to
[SPEAKER_03]: be an advertisement.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can come to our booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're using blockchain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're actually, I mean, no matter what
the technology is, I think here,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's hardware or software,
there are ways to use existing technology
[SPEAKER_03]: to automate processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are ways to use new technology to
push the envelope.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole bunch of innovation that's
coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things also that struck me
about this panel was how international it
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have people here with international
experience and technology certainly across
[SPEAKER_03]: oceans is different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of us are looking at the
compliance space one way or another.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about, just shout out, where do you
think the international cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_03]: in some ways has started to reform or put
pressure on or change the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry in other places?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how does this industry now being
international play into the revolution,
[SPEAKER_03]: revolutionizing idea of tech and its
application?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you see that happening?
[SPEAKER_14]: The last 12 months, we distributed into 90
countries around the world.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's very international and it's
everywhere available.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, with this technology,
you have then the way how you can consume
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis in a medical way.
[SPEAKER_14]: You have then an average usage,
you can track all that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the technology is really nowadays
distributed worldwide in a very fast way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But his compliance is different from
country to country, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, we are a European country.
[SPEAKER_14]: We are here a medical device manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_14]: A medical device manufacturer means that
he needs to have a quality management
[SPEAKER_14]: system.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called traceability, what is called
seat to sail.
[SPEAKER_14]: On the other hand, on the device,
that is traceability.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you get back defective device with a
serial number, you must be able to track
[SPEAKER_14]: back where you purchased every single part
you built in and where you have it sold
[SPEAKER_14]: to.
[SPEAKER_14]: So data requirements are relatively high
and they are different from country to
[SPEAKER_14]: country.
[SPEAKER_14]: For example, we don't have a medical
device in the USA because the FDA is not
[SPEAKER_14]: ready to approve a medical device.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then if you go to Israel, you have,
of course, other requirements.
[SPEAKER_14]: Labeling in Hebrew and Arabic can also be
challenging.
[SPEAKER_14]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the latest compliance thing we got is
the GDPR, the general directive from
[SPEAKER_14]: DSGVO, Datenschutzgrundverordnung.
[SPEAKER_05]: Privacy.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, privacy law.
[SPEAKER_14]: So this gives you also another compliance
thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: What I think from people from North
America, they are not ready for the GDPR
[SPEAKER_14]: as far as I can see.
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, the law is less than a year
old.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's a strict law.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's really a highly punished law.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it will be followed.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it will also affect a lot of
people who touch Europe in any way with
[SPEAKER_14]: their products.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is some compliance coming up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll take the next one.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an interesting question on
compliance.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we do business in Canada, US.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a number of international
companies in Colombia, Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_10]: Australia, Denmark that we're dealing with
right now in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the platform is already international.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you look at the platform we're using
for ERP, it's already almost in every
[SPEAKER_10]: country in the world, including Germany,
just not in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the Canadians, when they came into the
space with their LPs, and we came in a few
[SPEAKER_10]: years afterwards, we saw the legacy of
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Compliance to them was just, am I
compliant to Health Canada?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm meeting the regulations so I can
keep my license.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they didn't think about compliance in
any other way.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now all of a sudden, the Canadians are
coming to us and asking, asking us for
[SPEAKER_10]: GMP.
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, I think they probably had to
look up the acronym, as most of us do,
[SPEAKER_10]: good manufacturing process, which in order
to export your product from Canada to
[SPEAKER_10]: countries like Germany, you have to prove
that you are a GMP processing facility.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Canadians weren't thinking of that
at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think in some ways, the international
space has a way to benefit from what was
[SPEAKER_10]: already learned in the US and Canada,
not do the same things, look at it as a
[SPEAKER_10]: business that has to be compliant versus a
compliant industry specific to cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: that has to run a business.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's compliance everywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: GDPR, GMP, FDA requirements are not in the
US yet, but they're coming.
[SPEAKER_10]: So all these things have to be in place.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're public companies now trading.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now SOX compliance and how your
financial reporting goes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we actually had to employ, which I
didn't think I'd ever have to do running a
[SPEAKER_10]: software company, as higher compliance
chief officer, just for us to handle not
[SPEAKER_10]: only what's going on in cannabis,
but also the compliance that's coming at
[SPEAKER_10]: us from everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to push this one to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a discussion about what can
technology do to revolutionize the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think sales and advertising is certainly
there, however controversial.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted to throw it in that direction
because the questions about how technology
[SPEAKER_03]: can be applied to overcome some of the
bigger issues, whether it's compliance or
[SPEAKER_03]: laws or et cetera, and certainly sales
online, the discussion of the industry
[SPEAKER_03]: press online 2014 helped push forward a
whole bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you see this working?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you see this technology discussion
changing regulatory frameworks that are
[SPEAKER_03]: still holding the industry back like
advertising or et cetera?
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a very important point to
remember that everybody's very afraid of
[SPEAKER_09]: compliance, GDPR, and they're very worried
about, well, what are we going to do with
[SPEAKER_09]: it?
[SPEAKER_09]: But essentially if you look at it,
it could be a huge opportunity because the
[SPEAKER_09]: existence of GDPR raises the bar and
allows you, if you build systems in place
[SPEAKER_09]: to comply with that, allows you to create
modes around your business.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for example, part of GDPR, and I'll get
to the advertising and sales point in a
[SPEAKER_09]: moment, part of GDPR is security by design
or segregating data, not collecting data
[SPEAKER_09]: that you shouldn't if you don't need it
for true processing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for example, one of the things with
automatic processing of data is that it's
[SPEAKER_09]: not exposed to humans.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can segregate it within the system
and then you're protected from a
[SPEAKER_09]: compliance perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can automate a lot of the requirements
that GDPR has and then you create those
[SPEAKER_09]: modes around the business and you use that
as an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_09]: Specifically around sales and marketing,
that's really interesting because I spent
[SPEAKER_09]: the morning talking with a lot of CBD
producers and suppliers here and the one
[SPEAKER_09]: thing that everybody spoke about is like,
we cannot advertise, we cannot sell our
[SPEAKER_09]: products online, or sorry, we cannot
advertise our products online,
[SPEAKER_09]: even though there was a panel previously
that spoke about the exact same point.
[SPEAKER_09]: And CBD, let's take it as an example,
in many countries is completely legal.
[SPEAKER_09]: However, the big advertising networks like
Google and Facebook, AdSense, DoubleClick,
[SPEAKER_09]: et cetera, those are the ones that don't
allow you to advertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what happened to Google and GDPR
in France?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to come back to you though,
because I think your system actually helps
[SPEAKER_03]: people comply by automating it literally
by using the legal form.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're kind of combining those two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to talk a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, just as you were stating
about, you know, the different countries
[SPEAKER_08]: to have different laws, or they're just
coming online or becoming aware and
[SPEAKER_08]: educated, just in the state of California
alone, it's like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like the whole world or all world's
policies in one state.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as we go from city to county to the
state level, it's all different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like you go throughout the United
States, it's all different.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've had to find a way to kind of jump
that based on best practices.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know that the FDA is going to step in
eventually, just like you have.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should always be focused on good
manufacturing practices or good business
[SPEAKER_08]: practices.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very important factor.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're coming in and exporting to the
EU as well, because if you're not
[SPEAKER_08]: compliant, then you're not going to be
able to serve that market.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that when it comes down to it,
when it comes down to technology,
[SPEAKER_08]: let me ask real quick, how many people in
this room right now are in a startup mode
[SPEAKER_08]: for a tech company or are in a tech
company right now?
[SPEAKER_08]: How many people?
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are not limited is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: With technology, you can license that
technology.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can take that technology to other
countries.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not limited like cannabis is
limited.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the fact that we are a technology
firm, we're able to actually serve more
[SPEAKER_08]: markets than our counterparts who are in
the cannabis industry trying to get
[SPEAKER_08]: licensed and sell cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the thing that we always need to
compare that to, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_09]: you said licensed technology to others,
is AWS.
[SPEAKER_09]: AWS started as an internal solution for
Amazon because they couldn't find
[SPEAKER_09]: something that met their needs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it grew to a $10 billion a year
business.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because who here doesn't or uses AWS in
their business?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we can all agree that in some
ways, technology is revolutionizing the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry because it's normalizing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's saying this is just a commodity or et
cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as a way of a lead in, I saw a lot of
hands go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of people in startups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would like to now open the field
for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have questions, please go ahead
and bounce them back to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because one of the things we were talking
about before we came on here is I think
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm one of the few people actually who's
gone through the German incubation system.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are opportunities if you are
starting to look at applying technology
[SPEAKER_03]: and want to apply technology in this
revolutionary business, where you can
[SPEAKER_03]: start to enter the market in new and
different ways, in part by normalizing
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: In part by saying, I'm not just dealing
with cannabis as this crazy plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm dealing with a narcotic that's an off
label drug that has to be approved or et
[SPEAKER_03]: cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I have to track plant for da da da.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think how would you say that,
and you're gonna, I'm gonna pick on you
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you say that technology has
changed the equation in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: normalization, if that makes any sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, you have to go through
insurance approvals as a medical equipment
[SPEAKER_03]: provider.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the only person on stage who has to
go through that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So technology is also adding a different
level of compliance to you as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that revolutionary to you, for example?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, as a medical device manufacturer,
of course, there are a lot of medical
[SPEAKER_14]: devices.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not so important if it is for
cannabis or for something else.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to follow the medical device
rules and they are there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you comply, you comply.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's also no reason then to decline
any allowance to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: On the insurance side, yeah, we have tried
to get here in Germany, generally
[SPEAKER_14]: recovered to get on, there's a list,
the Hilfsmittel list there, where you can
[SPEAKER_14]: get on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you get, then the doctor can
prescribe it and the patient get it
[SPEAKER_14]: reimbursed.
[SPEAKER_14]: But unfortunately, we have not reached to
get on this list yet.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are still too many hurdles and they
are still unsure and they fear that they
[SPEAKER_14]: get a lot of prescription for it.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there we are working for and hopefully
soon we will have to, we are on that list.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can work together on that question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So any of, I mean, I think, for example,
you, for example, are actually in the
[SPEAKER_03]: licensing and processing approval
discussion, correct?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, essentially,
again, it comes back to the regulation at
[SPEAKER_08]: the state level in the US, in this case,
in Germany or other areas, if they were to
[SPEAKER_08]: do licensing, it would be at the,
obviously, the government level.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we do is we sort of analyze when
regulations come out, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: regulations are shifting and changing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's dynamic compliance, I like to call
it, really, because this whole space is
[SPEAKER_08]: very dynamic.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when it comes down to it, we have to
really navigate these processes.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we can accelerate it and lower the
barrier of entry and promote more
[SPEAKER_08]: diversity and bring more players into this
game, you know, and really get it to the
[SPEAKER_08]: point where folks can really innovate,
we are going to see a hyper jump in that
[SPEAKER_08]: space in terms of technology, in terms of
how, you know, folks actually operate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we want to ensure that first that
you guys get permitted and regulated and
[SPEAKER_08]: licensed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's ongoing compliance
partners that handle everything else
[SPEAKER_08]: because everybody's focused on that
section as opposed to the pre-license
[SPEAKER_08]: section.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's where our focus is.
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, coming back to technology and
how it's changing in the face of the
[SPEAKER_08]: landscape, there's things like the
internet of things, for instance,
[SPEAKER_08]: IOT.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're seeing IOT manage like how the
plant's growing, you know, checking,
[SPEAKER_08]: there's like full automation on this,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so as a business owner that's trying
to scale and serve a high demand in this
[SPEAKER_08]: marketplace, things like that are pretty
important.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it lowers the cost associated with
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're able to really magnify the ability
to grow this plant exactly the same way
[SPEAKER_08]: over and over again, which is consistency.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a fractured supply chain,
not only on the global level, but on,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, just the base of the US or just
based in the state of California.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still a fractured supply chain.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're not able to get the same
consistency of products because businesses
[SPEAKER_08]: are scaling and this is a plant that
changes its, you know, its consistency
[SPEAKER_08]: over the course of time as you scale it or
add nutrients or add different lighting or
[SPEAKER_08]: add different management techniques on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really interesting to see how
technology is shaping that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But most importantly, is that this
innovation is gonna never stop.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gonna happen over and over and over
again, just like with the internet when it
[SPEAKER_08]: first came out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I like to compare it to that because
that's how fast this thing is moving,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I would highly recommend taking
advantage of that, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna throw this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anybody with questions right now
who wants to ask the panel anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so you wanted, I'm sorry,
I think you had a specific issue that you
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to bring up in terms of,
I think that you were sort of talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about the fact that to try to take it to
the next level of all of us in some ways
[SPEAKER_03]: from a technology panel or technology
solution.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just generally lessons learned,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: Coming with it from a platform that
already works in other industries and
[SPEAKER_10]: coming into the cannabis space into North
America.
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, the international space has
a once in a lifetime opportunity to set
[SPEAKER_10]: their business up from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not only because cannabis is new,
but the businesses are new and setting it
[SPEAKER_10]: up the right way.
[SPEAKER_10]: With technology and making some of the
right decisions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: companies that are in the space have
probably gone through two, three,
[SPEAKER_10]: four different iterations of solutions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever they tried in the beginning
didn't work.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're now on to multiple others.
[SPEAKER_10]: And from our standpoint, this is where
we're now coming in from the outside
[SPEAKER_10]: saying, you're in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_10]: You grow in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_10]: People have been growing in greenhouses
for decades, hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's already software out there
that does that for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: So why are you trying to apply brand new
software to something that's already
[SPEAKER_10]: established out there?
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're kind of coming at it from a
different way saying you're in supply
[SPEAKER_10]: chain management that does agriculture,
that does food process, manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_10]: distribution, and potentially retail.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for us, we're not looking at it having
to introduce something brand new because
[SPEAKER_10]: the space requires it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to normalize it by saying it
already exists out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't go make the same mistakes that the
others did.
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you buying software from the ground
up that isn't proven anywhere yet,
[SPEAKER_10]: but is trying to find itself in the
cannabis space because it's going to get
[SPEAKER_10]: outscaled.
[SPEAKER_10]: As you normalize the business out there,
all those other things start to hit you,
[SPEAKER_10]: the normal business processes that every
other business runs in.
[SPEAKER_10]: In the end, you're here to make money on
these businesses.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just about you're in the cannabis
industry and what software will work for
[SPEAKER_10]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is where I'm hoping to introduce
a little bit of controversy here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously, MedPay is using a new
technology called blockchain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do you integrate that into a new
industry while minimizing risks and
[SPEAKER_03]: attacking the issues that you're
attacking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one of the ways that we have decided
to go forward on this is actually blending
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're holding workshops where we're
bringing stakeholders together who aren't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily tech geeks, but they're
business people with problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're coming together and they're
discussing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is how we're starting to,
I think, also start to pin new technology
[SPEAKER_03]: processes and re-engineering into a new
business, which it very much is here,
[SPEAKER_03]: as much as we are, I guess, re-engineering
processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that this for us, the cannabis
vertical has given us a way to address a
[SPEAKER_03]: larger problem that is faced, for example,
by the chronically ill, people who need to
[SPEAKER_03]: get expensive medical equipment,
pharmacies, people who are touching this
[SPEAKER_03]: ecosystem but didn't necessarily have
another way to touch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to throw something also out
here, because everyone's talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: this, the whole enabling aspect or not
enabling aspect, especially when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: throwing privacy and all the other issues
about online sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because online discussion about this
industry, I think, has very much led to
[SPEAKER_03]: greater legalization as much as
governments have not maybe gotten the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation right so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: But clearly, I think the online discussion
in technology does lead to online sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would anybody like to take a dive into
that and also from the enabling and also
[SPEAKER_03]: the privacy perspective?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can talk about the online aspect
of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, at the end of the day,
that's where the industry or all
[SPEAKER_09]: businesses are going to, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because as humans, we are lazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want the path of least resistance.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I'm able to sit at home and if we
look at the full stack of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: industry and if I'm able to get a
prescription without leaving my house and
[SPEAKER_09]: then buy a volcano without leaving my
house and have it delivered, I will likely
[SPEAKER_09]: prefer it over having to leave,
get in my car, drive through snow,
[SPEAKER_09]: see a doctor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, go to a pharmacy, pick up the
product, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in regards to e-commerce, obviously,
I'm quite biased, so I can continue
[SPEAKER_09]: talking about that aspect for a while.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it is something that is driving this
industry forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me be a devil out again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it e-commerce or is it telemedicine?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that there are two
aspects.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the telemedicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the e-commerce.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the do people feel comfortable not
seeing a doctor?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are regulatory agencies particularly when
you get into the narcotics side of this
[SPEAKER_03]: going to say, yeah, the year is a schedule
to you and you don't have to come and see
[SPEAKER_03]: a doctor anymore?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that realistic?
[SPEAKER_03]: In Germany, Jürgen?
[SPEAKER_14]: In Germany.
[SPEAKER_14]: Today I read that you can get online to a
doctor and you can claim to be ill for
[SPEAKER_14]: your business and you get your,
this is a new system who is available
[SPEAKER_14]: here, but it's very controversial.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the doctor doesn't get paid yet,
by the way, so there's some issues.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, maybe another general remark.
[SPEAKER_14]: About compliance, because it was here
about fearing compliance.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's very important to be
compliant.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think every managing director,
CEO must take care to be compliant,
[SPEAKER_14]: and especially in this field, because on
the one hand, you don't want to get extra
[SPEAKER_14]: hurdles because you are treating something
with cannabis, but on the other hand,
[SPEAKER_14]: you also do not want to get to be very
favored because it's cannabis and think
[SPEAKER_14]: you can, you don't need to be compliant
because it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: Both sides, you don't want to see,
you want to see, you don't want to get
[SPEAKER_14]: extra hurdles, but you also want not to
get any easy way on some angle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move a bit beyond compliance,
because I think technology can also be
[SPEAKER_03]: used for research, right, and sort of the
big data gathering aspects, I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: of basically all of what we've decided.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think what's interesting about
you guys is you're moving more and more
[SPEAKER_03]: into a world where you can gather
information online, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: through the vape, I would assume,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say, but regardless,
I mean, there's definitely this whole
[SPEAKER_03]: discussion now about digital health in the
cloud and privacy issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone want to touch on that one?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we actually built, let's start with
the problem, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is that a lot of people use
cannabis, but there is no way for them to
[SPEAKER_09]: actually measure if it's helping them or
not.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are not a lot, but quite a few
companies that build solutions to address
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are one of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a great company that is out here
today, Strain Print, that does the same
[SPEAKER_09]: thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And essentially, it allows people to track
usage and the impact of products on their
[SPEAKER_09]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_09]: And initially, at least us, when we
released this, we were like, no one's ever
[SPEAKER_09]: going to give us any data.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were very surprised to see that
actually people were very forthcoming with
their data.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't Germans, though, were they,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: There might be Germans, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: But people were very, very forthcoming
with the data because there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: value that was created in exchange for
that data.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's something that is actually
moving forward.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the idea of being able to collect real
data from real people and analyze it and
[SPEAKER_09]: generate insights has value across the
entire industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: One, for patients, for example,
we're able to recommend what strains are
[SPEAKER_09]: right or wrong for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: For the industry, we're able to help
growers understand what's popular,
[SPEAKER_09]: what they need to grow because of growth
cycles.
[SPEAKER_09]: For device manufacturers, they can
understand what temperatures people are
[SPEAKER_09]: using.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it conduction, convection based?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are the most popular models?
[SPEAKER_09]: Et cetera.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is so many different elements that
can be used that are valuable for both
[SPEAKER_09]: parts of the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hands up.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people involved here in the
startup side are using technology in
[SPEAKER_03]: education?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hands up.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many are using it in compliance?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many are using it for medical
processing?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else who wants to speak up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we really are trying to encourage
technology companies to come forward and
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about their experiences because we
can all learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I will say that my experience here
has been actually to sort of use some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the stigma around this plant to actually
get people to agree to start to use new
[SPEAKER_03]: technology, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if people agree, yeah,
this is narcotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, we need to track it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, we can't really do this because
GDPR says we can't follow this,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that does also create a new
opportunity to apply new technology in a
[SPEAKER_03]: new way to fit and fix problems that are
affecting this industry as it normalizes
[SPEAKER_03]: and potentially other pieces of a larger
vertical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have any of you had experiences with that
that you would like to talk to?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, I'd like to come back to
what you stated about how there's nothing
[SPEAKER_08]: new here, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, at the end of the day,
there's technology out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not about reinventing the wheel.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about making that wheel way much
better, way better than what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The technology we developed, it was really
kind of out of multiple different pieces.
[SPEAKER_08]: We took the best of several different
pieces of technology that worked in our
[SPEAKER_08]: field and infused it together into
something that's brand-spanking new.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the same thing goes for a lot of these
different factors.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like you don't need to create
anything new, even unless it's something
[SPEAKER_08]: that has to be created new.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I encourage you guys to look out there
and see and do a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because before you spend all this money,
or your investor's money for that matter,
[SPEAKER_08]: on a lot of different things that is
already existing, just do a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: research first.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's a lot of things out there
that already serve that purpose.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're seeing a merge of all these
different industries merge into the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis industry from all different
fields.
[SPEAKER_08]: That includes medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: That includes technology.
[SPEAKER_08]: That includes agriculture.
[SPEAKER_08]: That includes retail.
[SPEAKER_08]: That includes supply chain tracking.
[SPEAKER_08]: That includes all different logistics and
transportation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's so many different things
happening globally that you just got to
[SPEAKER_08]: take from all these different industries
and then apply your own kind of style to
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also want to real quickly talk about
this whole telemedicine aspect of this,
[SPEAKER_08]: or just working with patients and
gathering that data.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_08]: His name's Dr. Led May.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's based on Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he runs a company called Endocanna
Health.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, what Endocanna Health does is they
take your 23andMe data and translate it,
[SPEAKER_08]: the information, into what would work best
for you in terms of cannabis products,
[SPEAKER_08]: what would work worse for you in terms of
causing stress or anxiety or different
[SPEAKER_08]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, really cool technology.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this way, you're able to get highly
targeted patient data that's really
[SPEAKER_08]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you know exactly what works for
you, because what will work for one person
[SPEAKER_08]: may not work for the other person.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really important to see that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to jump into here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the difference in privacy, the approach
to privacy from a technology perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: is very, very different depending on where
you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you're in California,
home of Google, and we don't care about
[SPEAKER_03]: privacy, and I'm going to say that because
they've just gotten a suit here in France,
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that there is a wide
opportunity here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that that is one of the issues
that we see, is that privacy and the
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of what privacy is and where
that data can go and who can have access
[SPEAKER_03]: to that and why is a discussion that I
think the cannabis industry in general and
[SPEAKER_03]: patients and doctors should step up on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're in that space.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't believe that private companies
should have as much information about
[SPEAKER_03]: people as they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see GDPR to your point,
I think, as a way of setting a much higher
[SPEAKER_03]: standard where patients actually have
control where they don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that in itself is something that we
can enable with the use of technology
[SPEAKER_03]: while giving industry more information
that they ever possibly could have hoped
[SPEAKER_03]: for.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is completely anonymized because of
the way that we approach it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe that is one of the ways to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can talk a bit about privacy,
because I think this is a huge,
[SPEAKER_03]: huge discussion that is not often talked
about because people are like,
[SPEAKER_03]: GDPR, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't affect my business.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Germany or in Europe right now,
a GDPR violation, one GDPR violation,
[SPEAKER_03]: they can ding you 4% of global sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you think about just the cannabis
perspective of this beyond the fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: privacy as a medical discussion should be
baked into all of us, this particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: can hurt a company who has small medical
sales here in Germany but a global
[SPEAKER_03]: footprint, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you think that, and I'm going to
maybe end this a little bit early because
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to speed things up and make sure
this conference moves on, but how do you
[SPEAKER_03]: see technology influencing the privacy
conversation?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say if you want to add in the
cannabis industry, fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that technology can be used to
highlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, are you making plans to
give people their own personal cloud
[SPEAKER_03]: access, for example?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or in your industry, are you thinking
about the fact that, yeah, I've got to,
[SPEAKER_03]: are there privacy aspects on the B2B side
that maybe we haven't thought about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that is, from my
perspective, that is where I spend a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of my time thinking and planning and
working.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just jump in there, because what you just
said is so complex depending on where you
[SPEAKER_10]: are.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we conduct business in the US.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's over 30 states that we're having
to deal with.
[SPEAKER_10]: We deal with Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: The data that we take from our customers
is not our data.
[SPEAKER_10]: We put it into Azure.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's your environment and our model.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the data is yours.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just have to help you manage it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in Canada, the data has to stay inside
of Canada.
[SPEAKER_10]: So as a technology company, we have to put
platforms up everywhere that comply to
[SPEAKER_10]: that requirement that really has nothing
to do with, cannabis has more to do with
[SPEAKER_10]: the data side of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So privacy relates to the consumer,
but it also relates to your data.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody's coming to us looking for
aggregated data on your business.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not just from what you're selling to
patients, but what products are selling.
[SPEAKER_10]: Every other industry has aggregated data
that they're looking at.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you come from the hotel industry,
every hotel knows how busy this hotel was
[SPEAKER_10]: last night, what the occupancy was here as
it compares to everybody else and what the
[SPEAKER_10]: average room rate was.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this industry needs to know the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: What products should I be selling?
[SPEAKER_10]: How much does it cost me to produce that
product?
[SPEAKER_10]: How can I be more efficient?
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have to share the aggregated data
as a community so that we can all get
[SPEAKER_10]: better at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then there's the privacy of that
information.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we don't give that data out.
[SPEAKER_10]: That has to be you guys providing that
data amongst yourselves and then a
[SPEAKER_10]: community setting itself up where that
aggregated data gets used.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I think we're being signaled from
the side here that we're running out of
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last call for any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can catch us later.
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is, good.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Salo from Clover Botanics.
[SPEAKER_12]: Conversation is very interesting because
we launched our online shop in UK,
[SPEAKER_12]: but the plan was to produce two apps,
one for Android, one for iOS and connect
[SPEAKER_12]: the Shopify into the app.
[SPEAKER_12]: So when we sell a product, we want to
capture the information from the customer,
[SPEAKER_12]: how they used it and how it can help for
us to choose the next product.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the GDPR thing you talked about is
very interesting because we're already
[SPEAKER_12]: starting to sell not just in UK,
but Germany and France.
[SPEAKER_12]: And how do we sort of manage that is a
thing that I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder whether you have any ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come talk to us later, but for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think the rule is privacy by
default or privacy by design.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the tracking you have needs to be
disabled, but you are able to ask your
[SPEAKER_14]: client that he shares the information with
you.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's still possible.
[SPEAKER_14]: You just need to say why you want the data
to be collected, what kind of data you
[SPEAKER_14]: want to collect it, and you need to ask
for permission and you can do the same
[SPEAKER_14]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And patients can ask for it back too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other thing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is complex.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, GDPR sounds scary, but it's quite
simple.
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as you get consent and there is a
reason for you to have that consent,
[SPEAKER_09]: which sounds like you want to provide
better service to your customers,
[SPEAKER_09]: just build your privacy policy in a way
that gets that consent and then you can do
[SPEAKER_09]: pretty much whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as you define yourself as the
data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Short answer is complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: And see us later too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a quick question.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you talk about AI and all these
things, how do you deal with implicit
[SPEAKER_06]: biases or the challenges you have of
gathering quality information?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you can make the smartest machine,
but if you tell it dumb shit, it's going
[SPEAKER_06]: to be a dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like garbage in, garbage out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the same.
[SPEAKER_13]: The expert evidence in the Vancouver
dispensary case was that patients want to
[SPEAKER_13]: see the product, smell the product,
like going to the grocery store and buying
[SPEAKER_13]: your groceries.
[SPEAKER_13]: So how do you deal with that?
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a license to sell online.
[SPEAKER_13]: Canada only allows that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you and Sharper's Drug Mart are
the only ones who have it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Medical patients only get it in the mail
and they complain that it's in the
[SPEAKER_13]: container.
[SPEAKER_13]: They have to open it up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes there's some problem with it.
[SPEAKER_13]: They send it back.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it delays them getting their medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the evidence from the patients and an
expert, Dr. Zabirkis from the states was
[SPEAKER_13]: that this was a very important part of
delivering medical for medical patients.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not sure if the drone can come and
drop down and give an option and go back
[SPEAKER_13]: up and you can pick or how are you going
to deal with that technology?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but in Germany, actually that's illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to go to the pharmacy and the
medical, I guess, culture here,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the apothecas are trained to
actually, I mean, that's why they want
[SPEAKER_03]: patients to go to the pharmacy to
literally have the pharmacist who is
[SPEAKER_03]: trained in this hand over that drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to your point, there may be regulatory
issues that say you can't do it as you're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing in Canada, which affects other
cities to sale, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you're going to also in terms of
access issues, if you're too sick to get
[SPEAKER_03]: to the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those are places where technology can
in fact begin to start to connect them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as we find, privacy issues all are all
the way along this because it's not just a
[SPEAKER_03]: product that you can buy like a regular
commodity product.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is still stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So privacy is in the room at every single
point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually, I think it's going to be
based on preference.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you prefer to have a drop ship
to your front door, then OK, but that will
[SPEAKER_08]: never replace the retail experience of you
going in there and smelling different
[SPEAKER_08]: things.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing it will do is enhance it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're seeing enhancement of that
retail experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in Vancouver is a lot different than
Germany.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the evolution from medical to
rec that we're seeing as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're coming from a North American
perspective, you're already going,
[SPEAKER_10]: well, isn't it just like alcohol?
[SPEAKER_10]: And why can't you buy it and consume it
like you do alcohol?
[SPEAKER_10]: And internationally, we're still talking
about it medically.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what is it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it a medicine?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you pick it up in a pharmacy?
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you get it online?
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think if you look forward a few
years, you're going to see that same
[SPEAKER_10]: change happen that's happening in North
America as it tries to embrace it in a
[SPEAKER_10]: recreational adult use way and have a
retail experience around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you know what's interesting
about Canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to drive it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in Canada, it seems like the privacy
aspect was not really brought up until it
[SPEAKER_03]: went into the recreational market,
which is an interesting twist,
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that question regards to brick and
mortar versus e-commerce is we shouldn't
[SPEAKER_09]: even be talking about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the same question that was 30 years
ago in regards to 20 years ago in regards
[SPEAKER_09]: to e-commerce in general.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now you see e-commerce growing
endlessly and malls in the US going out of
[SPEAKER_03]: business.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has nothing to do with privacy was
talking about the consumer experience of
[SPEAKER_09]: choosing a product without being able to
touch, smell, and understand it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a classic question of
e-commerce.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, weed is different.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to go a little long
because I'm getting passionate now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Weed is different than lumber or a
blender.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to smell a blender.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need to look at the crystals on
a blender.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to smell your weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to look at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You maybe want to talk to the person about
the genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you want to know something about the
grower and how it was grown and all these
[SPEAKER_06]: other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's completely different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't always get that experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but that's the maturity of the
industry.
Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because right now, I think that's because
inconsistent product might be coming
[SPEAKER_10]: through.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can't get the same experience each
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen, you can give five different
growers the same cut and come up with five
[SPEAKER_06]: different styles and five different smells
and five different effects all from the
[SPEAKER_06]: same weed.
