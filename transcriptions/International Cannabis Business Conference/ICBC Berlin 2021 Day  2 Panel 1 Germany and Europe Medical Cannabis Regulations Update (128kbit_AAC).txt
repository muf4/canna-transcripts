[SPEAKER_03]: Coming up next, he is the partner for
Dintons, and he's the head of the European
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please put your hands together and welcome
Peter Humbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for the kind
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen such a big, large group of
people coming together talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis since 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to thank Alex Rogers and
his team to put together such a wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: conference here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the difference between a
German speaker and a speaker from the US
[SPEAKER_01]: or the UK?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the speakers from the US or the UK
start their speech usually with a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Germans do that with an agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have skipped the agenda, but even worse,
I've skipped a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I want to do with you this morning
is to talk about with you to set the stage
[SPEAKER_01]: for your discussions today about the
cultivation of cannabis in Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is from a legal point of view and
excuse me, I'm a lawyer, kind of a long
[SPEAKER_01]: history.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all started back in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you definitely know is that the
liberalization of cannabis for medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose in Germany has not been caused by
a thoughtful discussion and a lengthy
[SPEAKER_01]: thought process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was triggered actually by a court
decision in 2016, which we heard
[SPEAKER_01]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very quickly, the legislator put
together some legal framework for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get the background clear here,
before 2017, we had around 600 to 1,000
[SPEAKER_01]: users of cannabis for medicinal purposes,
patients who have received a specific
[SPEAKER_01]: exemption from the BFM, which is the
German FDA, to use cannabis for their own
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes, for treating their disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those patients actually started
growing for his own purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the Germans are very good in,
and he received it immediately,
[SPEAKER_01]: is a cease and desist order.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he went to court and in 2016,
he received actually a positive court
[SPEAKER_01]: decision by the highest administrative
court in Germany that he is allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow his own cannabis, which for the
lawmaker is really a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have around 1,000 legalized
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why very quickly, in March 2017,
the liberalization of cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal purposes was established.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the necessity, and that's why I'm
telling you that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the grow, the cultivation of cannabis
for medicinal purposes needs to be allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under state control, according to the 1961
U.N.
[SPEAKER_01]: Single Convention, which you, I believe,
all know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though the consequence was that the Bay
Farm established a cannabis agency,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is going to control the respective
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cultivation process started with a
tender process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually back in 2019, the tender process
was ended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there were two tender processes with
legal hurdles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spare you all the details here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But last but not least, three companies
received altogether 13 licenses to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are Afria,
[SPEAKER_01]: Aurora, and Demekan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five licenses for Aurora, five licenses
for Afria, and three licenses for Demekan.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quantity in this tender is limited to
10.4 metric tons for four years
[SPEAKER_01]: altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means these three licensees are in a
position to produce together 2.6 tons per
[SPEAKER_01]: annum, which is from an agreement and I
will show you that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a market point of view, at least
that's what most thought, are neglectable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only half the truth, and I will
come back to that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would like to focus right now is,
just for you and for recollection,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the distribution channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: How currently, before really the cannabis
cultivated in Germany hits the market,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis products for medicine purposes
are imported into Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see it from a point of a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a company in Canada who is
cultivating cannabis flowers and would
[SPEAKER_01]: like to go to the German market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do they have to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they have to find an importer
besides all the legal necessities,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the legal documentation which they
need from the Canadian authorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: To export, to grow and export,
they need to have a German importer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The German importer then is going to apply
for the import license, always provided
[SPEAKER_01]: that he has been properly recognized as a
duly licensed importer for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: products in Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the consequence that A, he has to
name the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: B, he has to name the exporter,
the Canadian company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And C, he has to identify the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm coming to the monograph for
cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The product itself has to be identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: The application to the respective
authorities is, company A from Canada is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to export to Germany and we are
importing a product with a THC content,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say of 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's leave out the CBD percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we call that Charlie Watts in memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Charlie Watts product with 20% THC is
then legalized, licensed to be imported
[SPEAKER_01]: into Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: The German monograph, which actually
defines the quality requirements for that
[SPEAKER_01]: product, for all products, but now in
Pacific for Charlie Watts, stipulates that
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference between the applied 20% THC
content and what can be imported is
[SPEAKER_01]: limited to plus minus 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means the product which arrives in
Germany, Charlie Watts, can only have 22%
[SPEAKER_01]: THC or 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: All above or below does not fulfill the
quality requirements under the German
[SPEAKER_01]: monograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something which cultivators from
abroad and of course also within the
[SPEAKER_01]: European Union have to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very narrow corridor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not a cannabis grower,
but my clients told me that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a tomato plant, as we all know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, and we discussed it
actually yesterday in one of the panel
[SPEAKER_01]: discussions, is the future in order to
meet these quality requirements for
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine and cannabis only be achievable
if you do indoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or can you actually do also greenhouse and
maybe outdoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I've heard so far, if you want
to have a constant quality for a constant
[SPEAKER_01]: product, in this case Charlie Watts,
you actually need to have indoor growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor cultivation in order to really
reach the same quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether this is correct or not,
I leave it to you and all the growers who
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is something which has to be
taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, that's what I'm actually
pointing out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the products which are reaching
the German market may not have,
[SPEAKER_01]: are not fulfilling this quality
requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question is, what are the
consequences?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, it is not ready for
marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cannot be marketed.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it is marketed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The authorities currently are relatively
relaxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take into consideration that we will have
more cultivators, not only from abroad,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I will come back to that in a minute,
but also within the European Union,
[SPEAKER_01]: from Denmark, from Portugal, from Greece.
[SPEAKER_01]: The authorities, and that's I think an
important message for you, will closer
[SPEAKER_01]: look into the fulfillment of the
respective quality requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, coming back to GACP and GMP,
we also discussed that yesterday in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Investors Forum just for a second,
there is currently a route where GACP
[SPEAKER_01]: grown and cultivated cannabis is exported
into the European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: The normal route would be that the
respective cultivator receives EUGMP
[SPEAKER_01]: certification, which for those who are
abroad is difficult to achieve because it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs an on-site inspection from the
German authorities whether the grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cultivator abroad is fulfilling this
requirement, is fulfilling EUGMP
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are indeed officers from the
authorities flying to Canada, to Lesotho,
[SPEAKER_01]: to other countries outside of the European
Union, checking on-site whether the
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements are fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get the cultivator that gets the
respective approval and is then allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: export its product under EUGMP to Germany
or other European countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we have experienced in the last
couple of months, and you may have seen
[SPEAKER_01]: that also in the trade press, is that
cannabis flowers, just GACP processed,
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivated, cut, packaged, shipped,
has reached the European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has then been processed here in Europe
under EUGMP certification and then sold to
[SPEAKER_01]: those countries who allow medicinal
cannabis for their patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is of course a different route and
you may of course also calculate the
[SPEAKER_01]: respective saving on costs if you are not
actually doing EUGMP certified cultivating
[SPEAKER_01]: in a country outside of the European
Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether this route will be viable also in
the future is difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: The authorities are very closely looking
into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is actually one of those gray zones,
one of these gaps, I would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has been identified by companies
between GACP and GMP regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: GMP 1 and GMP 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a drying process allowed,
a pre-drying process allowed under GACP
[SPEAKER_01]: and of course everything which is now then
drying, of course and cutting and
[SPEAKER_01]: filtering and whatever is necessary to
really make a product out of it is under
[SPEAKER_01]: EUGMP or under GMP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these flowers, GACP flowers,
can only be pre-dried and then shipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the authorities are looking into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know whether this is a sustainable
route for the next let's say two to five
[SPEAKER_01]: years but it is a way which you should be
aware if you are in that market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk a little bit about the
quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not what has been imported.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the estimation of the Bayfarm,
of the Federal Opium Agency at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bayfarm, which is reported to the INCB.
[SPEAKER_01]: The INCB is the International Narcotic
Control Board established by the 1961 UN
[SPEAKER_01]: Single Convention which gives certain
quotas to countries for the importation of
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs but also of course for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the numbers for 2017 and up
to 2020 which the Bayfarm has reported to
[SPEAKER_01]: the INCB.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not actually importations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The importations for 2020 of cannabis
flowers are in the region of 10 metric
[SPEAKER_01]: tons, a little bit more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 28.4 for 2020 are also included
including of course extracts and by
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts we have to say that the
calculation is different from just on a
[SPEAKER_01]: per gram flower basis because it's
multiplied by a certain factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's getting a little bit complicated
but that's actually what the Federal Opium
[SPEAKER_01]: Agency has applied for at the INCB and the
INCB is of course very forthcoming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are actually approving quickly if you
have an additional need for importation in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to serve your patients in order to
serve the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: For 2021 it's 25 metric tons, a little bit
below of last year taken into
[SPEAKER_01]: consideration that the actual import was
of course below the 28.4.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why I'm saying that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming back to the 10.4 metric tons for
the German cannabis for four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm right in calculation it's 2.6
tons per annum which as I said is only
[SPEAKER_01]: half the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tender process and we have been
representing one of the, not one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: but one company in the tender process,
is that the Bayfarm can exceed,
[SPEAKER_01]: can increase the quantity by up to 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not only 10.4 so if you do it on
an annual basis it's 2.6 plus 50% then we
[SPEAKER_01]: are at 3.9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nearly four metric tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take into consideration that we had around
10 tons of flowers imported last year it
[SPEAKER_01]: is not neglectable anymore if the Bayfarm
is going to increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are rumors in the market that this
50% increase has been established I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't seen any public announcement yet
of the Bayfarm but the tender actually
[SPEAKER_01]: allows for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are the prices?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the prices for a per gram
flower sold by a German cultivator to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bayfarm?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's publicly available.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 2.2 euros.
[SPEAKER_01]: 220 per gram sold by the cultivator to the
Bayfarm because the Bayfarm is going and
[SPEAKER_01]: is obliged to purchase all the harvest of
the German cultivation and then distribute
[SPEAKER_01]: that to the pharmacies as the 1961 single
convention provides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very similar to the Netherlands where we
have also the OMC which is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: distributing all the cultivation of
cannabis flowers and products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivated in or produced in the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is what is the sales price
of the Bayfarm of the opium agency or the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis agency to the pharmacies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well there are rumors that it should be in
the region of 4.3, 4 euros 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which compared to the current pricing I
don't know whether you are familiar with
[SPEAKER_01]: the current pricing within the German
market is significantly lower than what is
[SPEAKER_01]: currently being achieved.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know in Germany cannabis products
are qualified as extemporaneous mixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been done to avoid two issues
when cannabis actually was allowed for the
[SPEAKER_01]: use as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one you don't need a marketing
authorization.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sell the product via the
pharmacies immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was one of the intentions of the
lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make cannabis as a medicinal product
available to the patients as quickly as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two cannabis products didn't have
to go through the price fixing mechanism
[SPEAKER_01]: for new pharmaceuticals for the German
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is a very complicated process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pfizer, Novartis, Sando and all the others
if they want to put a new pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: on the market they have to go through that
price fixing mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: This committee which is called the
Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you have different stakeholders of
the industry sitting there discussing with
[SPEAKER_01]: the manufacturer about the right price.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was not necessary for the cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had I would say paradise in 2017,
2018 even in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: The downside of the definition of cannabis
products as an extemporaneous mixture was
[SPEAKER_01]: that the pharmacies had to put on a
surcharge by law of 100% of the price they
[SPEAKER_01]: paid for the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of a sudden at that time let's say
go back to 2018, 2019 we had a per gram
[SPEAKER_01]: price of 10 euros for flowers sold by a
wholesaler or an importer to the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacies and then the 100% surcharge
came and all of a sudden we had a price of
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 euros per gram of cannabis flowers for
the patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be reimbursed by the respective health
authorities, sorry health insurances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have a compulsory health
insurance program here in place in Germany
[SPEAKER_01]: as you may know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which if you apply and get respective
approval reimburses you for the treatment
[SPEAKER_01]: of your disease with cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was difficult to say at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the health insurance companies actually
said well that's not possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to find a mechanism to really get
that under control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was done by the association of
the respective health insurance companies
[SPEAKER_01]: and the associations of the pharmacies by
setting a price of a maximum of 9.52
euros.
[SPEAKER_01]: 9.52 per gram as a price per gram sold by
wholesalers and distributors to the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course the surcharge will be
added but not 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is actually going down by quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having said that and knowing that
currently the pricing in the market is
[SPEAKER_01]: even below the 9.52 per gram because there
are rebates granted to the respective by
[SPEAKER_01]: the respective distributors and
wholesalers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The price of the German cannabis may have
an impact on the whole system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are pharmacies, there are single
pharmacies who actually already said why
[SPEAKER_01]: should I buy today from you your cannabis
for let's say 7.50 or 6.80 per gram if I
[SPEAKER_01]: can get that from the German distribution,
from the B-Farm actually for 14 euros.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of a disturbance already
going on in the market which you should
[SPEAKER_01]: know and which you should take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit of an overlook about the
importation of medical cannabis in 2017
[SPEAKER_01]: and up to 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see it's kind of different in
the quarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course everything was impacted by the
pandemic which we all know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cultivation process in Germany was
slowed down as well as the respective
[SPEAKER_01]: increase of the distribution to the
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know the distribution of
cannabis for patients in Germany is very
[SPEAKER_01]: well under control by the B-Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are a patient you have to go to
your physician, tell him that you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain disease which you believe should
be treated with cannabis and maybe he is
[SPEAKER_01]: even supporting that and is proposing this
to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the whole issue starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patient and physician have to sit together
and fill in I would say a significant form
[SPEAKER_01]: to apply for the reimbursement to the
respective health insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of all applications around 40% are
rejected, 60% are granted for
[SPEAKER_01]: reimbursement just over the thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is only are the new
applications or there are mistakes in the
[SPEAKER_01]: format, it's wrong information and the
rejection reasons are not really
[SPEAKER_01]: transparent to be very frank.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 60% actually are granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the physician has to monitor his
treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he has to report to the B-Farm for
which indication he has prescribed what
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of product and what is the result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look into that and if you,
I was helping in the industry for the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers industry for quite some time,
it is a large observational study.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a significant observational study.
[SPEAKER_01]: With now more than, I guess they said
around 80,000 patients, maybe more,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these data are all collected by the
B-Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are transparent, they are
reported.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's worthwhile to look into
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have for you put together the
respective indications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the vast majority of treatments with
medicine and cannabis is for pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Followed by specificity and other
indications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have discussed yesterday what is
really the future of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will we see finished products,
finished cannabis products like Sativax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are of course companies who are
doing clinical studies in different
[SPEAKER_01]: stages, clinical phase two, clinical phase
two A to B.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to see whether they can get the
marketing authorization for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: related products as a finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my point of view, and that's my
personal opinion, clinical studies in that
[SPEAKER_01]: field are difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course when we discussed that,
as I said yesterday, the end points
[SPEAKER_01]: defined in your clinical study have to be
very carefully selected.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you miss the end points, you fail with
your clinical study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even worse, according to the new
transparency rules regarding clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: study within the European Union,
this has to be published.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't hide that somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question is whether this has an
impact on the whole industry if clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: studies for specific indications are
failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the percentage of failing,
well it's difficult to say for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: because you know, cannabis is well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have the toxicity issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually start relatively quickly
with two A to B.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then into clinical phase three.
[SPEAKER_01]: But however, there are chances that you
will fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such, it has to be very well
considered whether you start into such a
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trial with a cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having said that, let's look a little bit
into what is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are those countries where we have
approved exporters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Netherlands, of course, and Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain, Portugal, Denmark, and Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm not mistaken, Lesotho is
already one of those countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means that cultivators, producers in
those countries have received the
[SPEAKER_01]: respective license to export their
products into the German market.
[SPEAKER_01]: In discussion currently, Malta,
Uruguay, Israel, Lesotho, and of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia who just recently changed their
legal system regarding the export of
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking into that, we will have a
significant number of new cultivators
[SPEAKER_01]: within the European Union who don't have
that EU GMP issue because their GMP
[SPEAKER_01]: certification in the respective countries
automatically recognized by all other EU
[SPEAKER_01]: member states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, those from other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will become from a distributor
market more to now from a cultivator
[SPEAKER_01]: market to a distributor market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The distributors may then look who is
actually providing a consistent and the
[SPEAKER_01]: right quality in order to market it within
the German market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for your consideration, we have,
of course, and we have heard that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: overproduction already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not really too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look into what kind of cannabis is
currently demanded in the market and what
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of cannabis is really produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently, and that's a very similar
development as in Canada, high THC
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage cannabis products are on demand
and they are not that significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: available on the market at this point in
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the challenges the industry
faces in the future here in Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned only the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the question regarding the ACP
products and the importation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is, I think, interesting is that lots
of issues are coming up with respect to
[SPEAKER_01]: the definition of cannabis as an
extemporaneous mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in 2009, we had a client who actually
asked, I would like to import irradiated
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for the microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a better microbiology if we're
going to irradiate them in the country of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we have to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We asked the Bay Farm, so what do we have
to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does our client have to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, well, yes, just do the
following.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inform the lower authority which is
actually approving the import for that
[SPEAKER_01]: specific lot and tell them that the
products are irradiated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They approved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was imported.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometime later, in 2019, actually,
what happened is that the Bay Farm changed
[SPEAKER_01]: its mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, if you are going to import or
distribute irradiated flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to have a special license in
addition to those licenses which have been
[SPEAKER_01]: granted, which is a license under the
so-called Amrat Foul.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the law for irradiated finished
pharmaceuticals, which the Bay Farm is now
[SPEAKER_01]: applying one-to-one to an extemporaneous
mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason, frankly speaking, I can't tell
you, because if you go by the definition,
[SPEAKER_01]: an extemporaneous mixture doesn't need to
have approval for irradiation because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not a ready-made pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the Bay Farm decided differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now comes the conclusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our clients has been asked whether
he, under the German Pharmaceutical Act,
[SPEAKER_01]: has a specific process for product
liability insurance in place for putting
[SPEAKER_01]: irradiated products, irradiated cannabis
flowers on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to have this kind of product
liability insurance under paragraph 93 of
[SPEAKER_01]: the Pharmaceutical Act, which,
by the way, has a coverage of 130 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the premium is significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one state authority in Germany actually
said, you have to have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, of course, have covered that for
the products which are irradiated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the irradiation license,
according to that state authority,
[SPEAKER_01]: is a marketing authorization which is
similar to the market authorization which
[SPEAKER_01]: is granted for finished products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are in this specific state,
you have a disadvantage by adding this
[SPEAKER_01]: significant insurance premium per annum to
your products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have looked into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly speaking, it is, as I said
earlier, a loophole, a gray zone,
[SPEAKER_01]: gray area, again, which one of the state
authorities has interpreted differently
[SPEAKER_01]: from others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have asked the others,
what are you doing with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you don't need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis companies in our state don't
need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an extemporaneous mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is giving just an overview about
how heterogeneous, even within the
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, different state authorities are
looking into regulatory matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last but not least, what is the future
of product in the market?
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, is the future ready-made
pharmaceuticals with marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: authorization?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the future flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now around, I would say,
you know that maybe better than me,
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% flower market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it extracts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it vaporizers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a vaporizer with an extra cartridge
would be a very good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only this one is already then a finished
product, not anymore extemporaneous
[SPEAKER_01]: mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only if the cartridge would be then filled
by the pharmacist and then can be put in
[SPEAKER_01]: the vaporizer, then it would qualify as an
extemporaneous mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that there are companies looking
into that, finding a way to work around
[SPEAKER_01]: that and see whether this is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult to foresee where the
market is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very dynamic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you have a look into the Canadian
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you have also a recreational market.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Germany, you don't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it will come, well, let's wait
until September 26 and see how the next
[SPEAKER_01]: government is looking like.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the conservative party is playing a
significant role in that government,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I would say we have to wait for
another five to seven years before the
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational use will come.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's different, we will maybe have that
very quickly or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see what September 26 brings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by having said that, I would like to
finish that keynote.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry that I don't have a joke for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of serious, giving you an
overview about the market, giving you an
[SPEAKER_01]: overview about what is happening to the
cultivation in Germany and what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: impact it may have to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter Homburg, one more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have time for a few questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have time for a few questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone have a question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you always have to sit in the back?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one question regarding the future
of reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you mentioned, under the federal court
rule decision, the law was made in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: that there should be availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the major point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are seeing changes in, for example,
the PZN numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easier to track which company does
which product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that with this change,
it might be possible to integrate cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: more into the German reimbursement system,
which would mean all those awful words
[SPEAKER_00]: like GBA, like all the things that the
pharmaceutical industry is fearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your outlook on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, currently we have this
wonderful situation that the prices are
[SPEAKER_01]: not really controlled except for this
fixing of the price between the wholesaler
[SPEAKER_01]: and the pharmacies at 9.52, which we all
know is even difficult to achieve because
[SPEAKER_01]: the market is, from a pharmacy point of
view, reacting differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have now large pharmacies or pharmacies
who are going to combine their buying
[SPEAKER_01]: power and discussing with respective
wholesalers the prices downwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seen various rebates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that as long as the
products are defined as extemporaneous
[SPEAKER_01]: mixtures, we will see a price fixing for
pharmaceuticals with the GBA, with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Gemeinsam Bundesausschuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, and that's something which you
should consider, if you are looking into a
[SPEAKER_01]: ready-made pharmaceutical with clinical
trials, getting marketing approval,
[SPEAKER_01]: then of course this product coming to the
market needs to go through the GBA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the question is, what is the
right price?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something which you have to bear in
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which today, pharmaceutical companies are
bearing in mind as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you that since 2019,
around 36 innovative pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_01]: produced by large pharmaceutical companies
have not reached the German market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have withdrawn after the discussion
with the GBA because they were not
[SPEAKER_01]: satisfied with the respective proposal for
the prices, for the German market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you have to know also is that the
German market is now a reference market
[SPEAKER_01]: for other markets regarding the pricing of
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: While this is not applicable, of course,
to cannabis products right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I said, as long as you are in that
safe area of extemporaneous mixture,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would really advise not to leave that
and not to move something from somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not very likely that we have a price
fixing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have price controls, definitely,
with regard to the reimbursement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so far, the health insurance companies
are more or less satisfied with that
[SPEAKER_01]: additional implementation of the 952.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Farzad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Denmark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, now I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Farzad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Denmark.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question regarding phase three
trial that you mentioned, that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: risk-taking by not meeting endpoints.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at the positive side,
what is the likelihood to protect your
[SPEAKER_02]: product and take a patent on your
indication?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the point is, of course,
if you have reached positive to be
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical phase three, and the failure rate
is relatively lower in comparison to the
[SPEAKER_01]: first clinical trial one and clinical
trial two phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have reached clinical phase
three, there's a likelihood that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to reach the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, you have a certain
protection of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we discussed it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effect of having a pharmaceutical
product on the market, which is properly
[SPEAKER_01]: recognized and has received marketing
authorization, is, of course, significant
[SPEAKER_01]: in comparison to selling flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but how you can protect it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be generic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody who's a cultivator, they can claim
for the indication like a generic product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at the first, not immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have kind of a document protection as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, if you are able to combine
your product with something new,
[SPEAKER_01]: you may also consider patent protection,
which is a big issue right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the industry, how can I try to obtain
patent protection, IP protection for my
[SPEAKER_01]: products?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are, of course, lots of
different thoughts about that,
[SPEAKER_01]: even with regard to application.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I apply?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not smoking, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of inhalers?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of vaporizers?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I protect these technologies?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a big issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
