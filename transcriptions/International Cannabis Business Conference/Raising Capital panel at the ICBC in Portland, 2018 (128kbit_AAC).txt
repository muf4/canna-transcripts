[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to talk about Raising Capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's moderated by Dean Arbit.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been a trailblazer, a trailblazer in
cannabis and cannabis related media.
[SPEAKER_05]: He helped found Smell the Truth,
which is a big website on SF Gate in 2011.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he currently, he's still the publisher
for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he runs a lot of other different
companies and he's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it for the one and only Dean
Arbit, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dean Arbit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the spirited welcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Alex, as always, he's not here,
but thanks for a great show and a really,
[SPEAKER_07]: really good lunch, by the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the investment panel,
something that is a very hot button sort
[SPEAKER_07]: of item right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've got two great experts.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got Ted Rowe and Arthur Kwan that I
want to bring up.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're going to do is talk about
investment and the need for investment,
[SPEAKER_07]: as we all know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you plan to scale in this space,
right now things have sort of reached a
[SPEAKER_07]: different level.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as we're seeing with big private
equity starting to come in, and obviously
[SPEAKER_07]: big money north in Canada, where federally
they're standing allows them to raise
[SPEAKER_07]: massive amounts of capital.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen constant installation brands
come in and dump $4 million into Canopy,
[SPEAKER_07]: blowing that valuation up.
[SPEAKER_07]: We see Tilray popping it over,
a valuation of basically making them a
[SPEAKER_07]: bigger company than American Airlines and
other very large concerns over there,
[SPEAKER_07]: which underscores the need for,
if you're going to compete, you need to be
[SPEAKER_07]: able to be well capitalized.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've got a couple of great resources
here that bring very different
[SPEAKER_07]: perspectives to investors because these
are the folks that will help you raise
[SPEAKER_07]: money, and they're the folks that will
help you make sure that you do it
[SPEAKER_07]: compliantly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll just have Arthur first just say a
few things about what you do in your
[SPEAKER_07]: company, the Canada Income Fund.
Hello?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Arthur Kwan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a Canadian.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run a private equity fund up in Canada
called Canada Income Fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got started earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: By way of background, I was a former
investment banker for 18 years in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Canada Income Fund is a diversified
cannabis investment fund.
[SPEAKER_02]: We invest across the entire value chain of
the cannabis sector, so cultivation,
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction, production, ancillary
services, and dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: To date, we have eight investments in our
portfolio, and we're actively looking into
[SPEAKER_02]: the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we've got Ted Rowe, who's a legal
professional and someone very well versed
[SPEAKER_07]: in the industry here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ted, a little bit something about yourself
and your practice?
[SPEAKER_07]: Testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Ted Rowe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an American.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a practicing attorney based here in
Portland.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been representing clients in a
variety of industries for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been representing people in the
cannabis industry for well over 10 years
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also represent foreign companies,
sometimes that are investors, sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: that are involved in cases or property in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: I specialize in business and intellectual
property.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ted, we'll go right back to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think something that's really
interesting about your perspective is that
[SPEAKER_07]: you work with different types of entities,
clearly, and in investment circles,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a huge line between being a
company that touches a plant versus a
[SPEAKER_07]: company that engages in an ancillary
business that does not.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with software, platforms, pipes,
hardware, are there different strategies
[SPEAKER_07]: for approaching investors based on the
type of business that you run?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an excellent question because
sometimes I represent businesses that are
[SPEAKER_03]: seeking capital, and sometimes I represent
the investors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have perspective from both points of
view.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say with ancillary businesses,
we're dealing with something that's
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially unregulated, and I mean
unregulated in a way that is no different
[SPEAKER_03]: than a non-cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how you approach investors,
and there are going to be some
[SPEAKER_03]: similarities.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, one of the things that you're
going to want to ensure when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at investors, I'm sure Arthur can
speak to this as well, is that you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: have a proper valuation of your company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can speak about this later if we'd
like about some of the brief regulations
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're going to need to comply with,
SEC regulations, even to sell securities,
[SPEAKER_03]: sell stock in your company, essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the big things I see a problem
with frequently, and this is across the
[SPEAKER_03]: board, whether it's ancillary or direct
cannabis businesses, is an improper
[SPEAKER_03]: valuation done of your company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this creates a couple of problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is it's hard to have an investor take
you seriously because they know what the
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses are worth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you're coming in substantially
overvalued, it's hard to attract investors
[SPEAKER_03]: to begin with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two is it creates actual legal
problems for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you overvalue your company,
and then people invest in it, you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: potential of pretty high likelihood,
actually, that you could buy into what's
[SPEAKER_03]: called a minority shareholder lawsuit,
where if you can't deliver on the numbers
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're talking about, which is very
hard when you overvalue a company,
[SPEAKER_03]: that minority shareholder is going to sue
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a corporate officer, you have a
fiduciary duty, a legal duty, to minority
[SPEAKER_03]: shareholders.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one thing to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing that is different in how you
approach investors from, whether it's
[SPEAKER_03]: ancillary or cannabis-related,
is are they permitted to invest in your
[SPEAKER_03]: company to begin with?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had an interesting discussion in
the green room before we came out about
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is, if it's an ancillary service,
anyone can invest in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be a foreign national.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be someone from another state.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if it's a direct cannabis
business, if it requires a state license
[SPEAKER_03]: as a producer, retailer, wholesaler,
or processor, for example, in Washington,
[SPEAKER_03]: not only can foreign nationals not,
you can't even be from another state.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be an Oregon resident.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon has a much less strict scheme.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, that being said, there's nothing
in the regulations that permits it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't not allow it, if that
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, we have to get background
checks to be licensed in a direct cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: business in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, how can Oregon do that if it's a
foreign national?
[SPEAKER_07]: What makes it tough is if you're,
for instance, a company that's regulated
[SPEAKER_07]: and you've got to do background checks,
if you have a public company, for
[SPEAKER_07]: instance, that's on your, that owns more
than 20% of your company, then technically
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody from that public company,
all the directors, would need to get
[SPEAKER_07]: background checks for the application for
a grow or a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a little prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_07]: But those are great points, Ted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's maybe shift a little bit to one of
the interesting things having a Canadian.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are the guys with all the money
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And access to capital being what it is,
there are a lot less companies actually
[SPEAKER_07]: making money in cannabis in Canada
relative to the US.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so right now, we spoke, you've got
several investments in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're evaluating concerns, and right now,
you're evaluating opportunities in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interesting thing about the US market
that we're finding is that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: companies that we're evaluating,
either in California or Nevada or Florida,
[SPEAKER_02]: they all have revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of them, actually, not only do
they have revenue, but they have positive
[SPEAKER_02]: cash flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a bit of a refreshing change
from in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, there's about 120 ticker
symbols on my screen right now of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannabis-related companies on either
the Canadian Securities Exchange or the
[SPEAKER_02]: Toronto Venture Exchange or the big board,
the TSX.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of them are at the pre-revenue
stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in our portfolio of companies,
only two of them are in revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we like the US market so
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're actively seeking investments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's certain foreign investment
requirements that we need to follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of capital in Canada
right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Arthur, are there specific verticals or
segments of the business that you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: find more attractive?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So almost all the companies that we're
evaluating right now are vertically
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated or they have multi-licenses
across multi-states.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems to be the area that's
attracting the most amount of capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's no surprise that there's been a
proliferation of US companies doing RTOs
[SPEAKER_02]: or reverse takeovers onto the Canadian
Securities Exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we all know about MedMen, green thumb
industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm aware of at least eight other US
companies that are filing their listing
[SPEAKER_02]: statements or prospectuses to become
listed on the CSC right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a very hot market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we actually discussed, and I think in
both sort of comments there, I think
[SPEAKER_07]: valuation is a big thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think maybe to come back to that and
we can sort of, both your comments as far
[SPEAKER_07]: as opinions, are there multiples right now
that we're seeing that are sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: prevailing?
[SPEAKER_07]: How you value your business, X amount of
income equals this value or revenue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we look at evaluating a potential
investment, we look at three things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one is the management team
and the board of directors.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have they done before?
[SPEAKER_02]: Their track record, their backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the second criteria is, generally
speaking, we look at the business plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: What segment of the value chain they're
in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether we see it as, and what's their
niche or their competitive advantage in
[SPEAKER_02]: that segment?
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, we look at valuation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's no surprise that the valuations
are just insane in the public markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're evaluating companies that
are in revenue, what we typically do is we
[SPEAKER_02]: apply some sort of financial metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe EV to EBITDA or price to cash
flow or price to revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we take a discount of that to the
publicly traded comparables.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a company is pre-revenue, then that's a
general rule of thumb where we need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable with the management team and
their ability to execute on the business
[SPEAKER_02]: plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're coming to us at,
say, a pre-money valuation of X million,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to justify that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with a company that doesn't have
revenue, the financial metrics go out the
[SPEAKER_02]: door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's more of a qualitative judgment
on management as opposed to a
[SPEAKER_02]: quantitative, pure quantitative measure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And probably you're leaning on scarcity or
other variables there that make that
[SPEAKER_07]: offering unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ted, did you have some insight?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree in large part with what Arthur
said.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen one of the largest things that
you discussed that's important to my
[SPEAKER_03]: clients when they're investors are the
management team.
[SPEAKER_03]: And definitely my clients have had me do
background checks on board of directors of
[SPEAKER_03]: companies before they put a penny in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that being said, and I agree also that
with existing companies that have an
[SPEAKER_03]: existing revenue stream, it's somewhat
easier to approximate valuation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have hard assets.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have your P and L you can look at to
start giving you an idea of the value of a
[SPEAKER_03]: company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beyond the more esoteric valuations of how
much do you trust the directors of the
[SPEAKER_03]: company to affect their business plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the real problem exists when it is
a pre-revenue company or even more
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult when it's a pre-licensed company
in this industry where you have a startup,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't even have a license yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you value this company?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a real question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what it ultimately comes down to,
if you set aside the value of the
[SPEAKER_03]: particular individual's involved in the
business and look at just dollar
[SPEAKER_03]: valuation, how do we do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I often advise my clients when I'm
representing, not the investors,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the other side, the business raising
the capital, to look at, just like when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're selling or buying real estate,
you look at comps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So often we will say, okay, we don't want
to overvalue the company, but we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to cut our legs out from us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be right in there of something
realistic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can look to comparable businesses
and what kind of revenue they're doing to
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of fill in that X in the equation,
although there is no magic equation that
[SPEAKER_03]: gets you to the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: What ultimately you're gonna have to do is
do an appropriate valuation based on
[SPEAKER_03]: comparable businesses, what they're doing
in the comparable market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what a cannabis retailer does in
Seattle is not what they do in Portland,
[SPEAKER_03]: is not what they do in Miami, is not what
they do in LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just isn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it has to be, you have to use
comparable numbers and you can't kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: overblow this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a startup might be much more valuable
if they already owned existing real
[SPEAKER_03]: estate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there are all kinds, especially
from foreign investment, because if the
[SPEAKER_03]: foreign investor doesn't have to invest in
real estate, there's a whole federal law
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't need to comply with then.
[SPEAKER_07]: True.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'll say this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, from being an investor and an
operator, one thing is looking at
[SPEAKER_07]: investors and trying to derive a valuation
as a company.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's also really, really important
to look at the kind of investor and how
[SPEAKER_07]: strategic that money is when coming up
with the valuation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can that investor do anything else for
you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can he open more doors?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is he gonna be there after you execute and
commit to rounds, the following rounds?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there's a lot of sort of beyond
how you measure the proper investor and
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of that strategic partner going
forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a lot of things that you
look at from the other side as well as a
[SPEAKER_07]: company.
[SPEAKER_07]: A company that's looking for funding and
what number I'd be comfortable with given
[SPEAKER_07]: what that investor is and the other sort
of resources that they bring, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a competitive space up in Canada for
both capital and what I would call good
[SPEAKER_02]: deal flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, one of the companies that
we invested in is a consumables company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're positioning themselves when that
segment of the market becomes legal up in
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were being courted by several other
private equity firms including us.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons why they chose to go
with us is because of the strategic value
[SPEAKER_02]: that we bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pretty well networked in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can open up a lot of doors in terms of
their distribution and dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their manufacturing strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think from the company's point of
view, you should always look at what type
[SPEAKER_02]: of investment dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why for a public company that's
raising capital in Canada, there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: tendency to bring on the fast money,
the guys that are in it for a short-term
[SPEAKER_02]: trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas on the private equity side,
the companies that we're talking to are
[SPEAKER_02]: more interested in the type of money,
the strategic value that the investors
[SPEAKER_02]: bring to the table, not just dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an excellent issue that you raised.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since I'm assuming, I could be wrong,
but most of you are businesses wanting to
[SPEAKER_03]: raise capital and not investors looking to
invest in cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to say this as well,
and that is don't think that you're the
[SPEAKER_03]: only one who has to have the background
checks done.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should check out your investors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should know who they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should talk to other people who
they've done deals with.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should know their motivation in
wanting to invest in your company.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ted, you know what a good point is?
[SPEAKER_07]: If anyone is worth their weight,
they'll be happy to give you resources on
[SPEAKER_07]: folks that they've done deals with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those folks should obviously be
proponents of these guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something to ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there is a circumstance where
you're asking for essentially deal
[SPEAKER_03]: references and they're unwilling to give
them, that is a large red flag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't care what they're promising
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a serious red flag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not saying just drop the deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would be very wary about moving
forward without additional information.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, I also want to let you
know that there's more than one way to
[SPEAKER_03]: raise money for your businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked about one of them,
which is essentially equity investment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not the only way of doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can structure these deals essentially
any way you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the large ways of doing that is
debt financing or essentially obtaining
[SPEAKER_03]: loans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, when I'm representing
companies like yours rather than the
[SPEAKER_03]: investors, I tell them to kind of steer
away, try to steer away from equity
[SPEAKER_03]: investment as much as you can,
rather than maybe do a one-year loan that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's called a convertible note.
[SPEAKER_03]: It converts to equity at the end of that
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you're doing the loan in the
name of the business, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: and say you're a producer and the crop
fails or the business ends up going under,
[SPEAKER_03]: you also don't want to have personal
liability for a $2 million loan.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, you need to know who
you're doing business with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because does this investor have eyes on
taking the business over?
[SPEAKER_03]: Business is business.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say that for a reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you need to be sophisticated business
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your strengths may lie in other areas,
processing, retail, production.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I first started lecturing at
these things years ago, and I talked about
[SPEAKER_03]: tax consequences, I said, I understand
that a lot of people who started in this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry were operating to a certain level
of illegality for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now that it's in the light,
everything has to be on the up and up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to pay your taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to pay your property taxes,
employment taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to comply with your
regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: These licenses are extremely valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't want to do anything that's
going to jeopardize them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that being said, look at all the
options available to you and not just one
[SPEAKER_03]: when it comes to the issue of raising
capital.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because debt financing is a perfectly
legitimate way of raising capital for your
[SPEAKER_03]: companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you go up and you win the pitch at the
ICBC like my folks over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that there are business owners
here in the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're sitting here because investment
is some interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there may be some questions
out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we're getting kind of down to
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to make sure that if there are
questions out there, that we can address
[SPEAKER_07]: them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So take it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this Oregon marketplace,
[SPEAKER_01]: which in the last year has turned into
people really needing to cut back and get
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller and get tight and get much more
control over their costs and get control
[SPEAKER_01]: over the actual amount that can be sold in
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: How then can you think about evaluation
when you're looking at a traditional thing
[SPEAKER_01]: like a multiplier of EBITDA?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're being, because of an
artificially restricted marketplace,
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount that's actually able to be sold
is restricted.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think about if you're a small
time, you know, we're a small farmer,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're looking to get outside investment
and we have to put evaluation on
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we ourselves think about it in
terms of our brain trust, in terms of our
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment, in terms of our proprietary
ways of going, knowing that multipliers
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes show things the wrong way?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's one of our problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'll start in on that because I
think it's a great question, but I don't
[SPEAKER_07]: think it does anything to actually really
turn any of the numbers upside down at
[SPEAKER_07]: all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's still market share and I
think it's par for the course because your
[SPEAKER_07]: competitors are dealing with the same
issues, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was a race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your guys, the prices here, the bottom
fell out, but you guys are all dealing
[SPEAKER_07]: with it, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the end of the day, you still have
numbers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got product going to stores.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's margins are down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's numbers are down.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the end of the day, if you have
market share here, when the market goes
[SPEAKER_07]: back up, your margins will rise.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think obviously a big part in something
that folks do know, serious investors do
[SPEAKER_07]: know about the push for Oregon to be an
export state, and that's clearly something
[SPEAKER_07]: that you all in this state really need to
fight for, really need to fight for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comps in a smaller marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know in the larger ones it's
easier, but... All your competitors,
[SPEAKER_07]: those are your comps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would argue that you have more comps
than other markets do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand your problem in that the
comps are all down, but that's not the...
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just trying to find the data,
the information.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you find who's doing what?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can talk to people, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to talk to people, but that's not
the only asset that you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: You talked about one potential revenue
stream that can potentially, I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: saying it can, but potentially can cross
state boundaries, and that is intellectual
[SPEAKER_03]: property.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can license processes, and that can be
a revenue stream for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And IP is one of those things that can be
more easily valued than the entire
[SPEAKER_03]: business, but I understand what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's talking about, I got my weed,
it's worth less now, and how do I value
[SPEAKER_07]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a business owner, if you're looking
for outside investment, but you're worried
[SPEAKER_02]: about valuation and multiples of EBITDA,
like Ted said, there are other
[SPEAKER_02]: non-dilutive investment vehicles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So loans are just one of them,
but I know of three Canadian companies
[SPEAKER_02]: that are offering royalties to U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So gross overriding royalties or gores is
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Convertible notes are convertible
debentures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's other avenues outside of equity
where you need to place a value on your
[SPEAKER_02]: business to access capital.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, the one thing is right now,
if you do have to raise and valuations are
[SPEAKER_07]: being depressed, then actually debt
financing is a pretty good way to sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: hedge against that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: More questions, Sengayo?
[SPEAKER_06]: The past administration had a hands-off
kind of attitude.
[SPEAKER_06]: With the current administration,
is there any concern of the feds coming in
[SPEAKER_06]: and making some sort of headways or waves?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I can speak to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There has been, well, Jeff Sessions did
say that he wanted to take a more active
[SPEAKER_03]: role in curbing the marijuana industry,
cannabis industry in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_03]: The coal memorandum still exists,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been nothing else that's
overridden that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, we had a discussion
earlier where we were talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: foreign investment and what effects that
could have, what could come into play in
[SPEAKER_03]: the United States with regard to foreign
investment into a direct cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I talked about, it's called 18 USC
1952.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a federal law that prohibits and
criminalizes the promoting distribution,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's all these adjectives,
of an illegal activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since cannabis is still listed in the
Controlled Substances Act, technically
[SPEAKER_03]: foreign investment could be viewed as a
violation of that law.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that being said, as far as I know,
it's not being prosecuted, but that
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't mean it won't be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And given the current administration,
let's put it this way, I felt safer under,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, in general under the Obama
administration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in general.
[SPEAKER_07]: You think?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, hello there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm currently actually an organ
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the oldest laboratory in Oregon for a
test of cannabis, and I'm seeking
[SPEAKER_04]: expansion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been warned that if I get investment
money from Canada, there's already been
[SPEAKER_04]: some people that have done this,
and something about not being able to
[SPEAKER_04]: cross borders and come across,
or vice versa, because of the investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you help clarify what that's about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm aware of several Canadians
that have been banned for life from
[SPEAKER_02]: entering into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: because they have either invested in a
cannabis company or smoked cannabis or
[SPEAKER_02]: tried cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just saying this to Ted in the green
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I came from Canada, I actually
brought two phones.
[SPEAKER_02]: My real phone that I put in my luggage,
and then a burner phone, in case I get
[SPEAKER_02]: stopped at the border.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the risk that you, as a
Canadian looking to invest in U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: companies, you have to take.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I can say is that that has not,
in my mind, deterred any Canadians from
[SPEAKER_02]: looking into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's several financial companies and
investment companies that are all actively
[SPEAKER_02]: looking into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the one thing about Canada is that
while there's no shortage of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: companies, like I said before,
most of them are at the pre-revenue stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at the multiples that
these companies are being traded at,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, you know, it's very lofty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never heard of that before,
though.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I think that if you go, so at the
border, if they ask you for what you do,
[SPEAKER_07]: you don't tell them cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't think he said you should
lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just said, if you're in production,
you can tell them you're a farmer and they
[SPEAKER_03]: still have that be a true statement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead and do your thing and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a funny story.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just told them I was attending a
conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were like, which conference?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, the International Cannabis
Business Conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they were like, did you bring any
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, no, you guys got pretty good
weed here in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, enjoy your vacation,
sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that happened when I left Berlin,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I don't think you need to let
on that you're a million-dollar investor
[SPEAKER_05]: in a bunch of cannabis industries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, if you're just coming to
town to throw a conference that they're
[SPEAKER_05]: throwing, they can't sweat you too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows what this American government's
going to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's ironic about this is that
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: has been promoting programs for many years
that solicit investment from foreign
[SPEAKER_03]: nationals.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're called EB-5 programs, where this
is a really large thing in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a way that, and it's a way to
fast-track somebody's immigration status
[SPEAKER_03]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can become a U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: citizen within a couple of years if they,
I think it's $5 million under certain
[SPEAKER_03]: projects, or $10 million under others.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that we are doing our own
country a disservice by not allowing this
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of foreign investment to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could be bringing in substantial
dollars.
[SPEAKER_07]: What it does is it brings forth how
fractured the laws are between state and
[SPEAKER_07]: federal, because when you've got a
Canadian coming from a place where
[SPEAKER_07]: federally, what he does is legal,
and he's coming to California,
[SPEAKER_07]: where we pay our taxes, or Oregon,
where we pay our taxes, and we pay for our
[SPEAKER_07]: permits, and we're vested in this
industry, yet it's still a crime because
[SPEAKER_07]: of the federal level, the federal layer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just part of the goofy nature of
where we're at.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's also why banking is what it is
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are just hurdles, and they'll
make us stronger, I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: More questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own a building, and I'm having great
difficulty in refinancing the building
[SPEAKER_00]: because originally the building didn't
have anything that had to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's your suggestion?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question on how to finance a
building without going to hard money
[SPEAKER_00]: lenders who charge you an arm and a leg
and want your leg as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can speak a bit to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a client in an identical
circumstance.
[SPEAKER_03]: What she's talking about is essentially
there's, because the banking industry is
[SPEAKER_03]: regulated federally, they have essentially
told banks that if they finance directly
[SPEAKER_03]: finance operations that house cannabis
industry companies, they can lose their
[SPEAKER_03]: licensure under the federal banking
regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not going to get financing from
U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bank or Chase, or just so completely put
that out of your head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't lie to you, you're in a tough
situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Outside of selling or self-financing,
hard money lenders or putting up
[SPEAKER_03]: sufficient, well, but even then,
even if you had sufficient collateral,
[SPEAKER_03]: you simply can't get financing from a
mainstream bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are, well, there was for a while
Merchant's Bank, M Bank, was doing it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they weren't for many years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did it for a little while,
but there's no banks, as far as I know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in Oregon that will do what you need to
have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Private financing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a hard money lender.
[SPEAKER_02]: So up in Canada, we have a couple REITs,
so Rio State Investment Trust,
[SPEAKER_02]: that focus on cannabis, Rio State.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there vehicles like that in the U.S.?
[SPEAKER_07]: There are REITs here, but obviously you
can't do that because of the federal
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they state-operated?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they state-operated?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are they private?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're private.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they lend against Rio State.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's essentially what he's
describing, what you're describing is hard
[SPEAKER_03]: money lending.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really that is your option,
and that's one of the reasons why those
[SPEAKER_03]: rates are so high, because they know
they're the only option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I've met with Canadian companies
as well who have been courting me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but from what I understand, from what you
said, that that's something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't even touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially under these circumstances,
I think you would be, that's one potential
[SPEAKER_03]: avenue for you, because you don't own a,
well, let me take that back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a license holder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I own a shopping center,
as well as I own cannabis companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I own licenses, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you need refinancing of a company that
is not a license holder.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is real estate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct, it's real estate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just real estate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real estate, but in whole.
[SPEAKER_07]: If she's taking money from the Canadians
for real estate, you can absolutely do
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That you can absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, that's one of the great things
that I do wanna tell everyone is you can
[SPEAKER_03]: break up your companies a bit and get
foreign investment by saying, allowing
[SPEAKER_03]: them to buy the real estate, and then you
pay them your lease.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a sale lease back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you have a hard asset that US
lending institutions have a tough time
[SPEAKER_07]: with, but not Canadian ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is permitted.
[SPEAKER_03]: You absolutely can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in the end, besides finding
investors who are interested in your
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses, please, please, please consult
with lawyers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying me, I mean, I'd be happy to
speak with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But talk to a lawyer, retain a lawyer,
because these are very technical rules
[SPEAKER_03]: that you could easily violate without ever
realizing it, and the penalties are
[SPEAKER_03]: relatively severe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one more.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the event that someone did get an
investor, let's say, have a company and
[SPEAKER_06]: you get an investor into, where's the
money gonna go into if we're having these
[SPEAKER_06]: banking issues already?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where are we gonna be able to get your
money in to be able to work it with the
[SPEAKER_06]: company that we are building?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the opportunities that we're
looking at is a vertically integrated
[SPEAKER_02]: operation in California, and so I asked
them the exact same question, and like Ted
[SPEAKER_02]: said, you can't go to Bank of America or
Chase or Wells Fargo.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what they said, they've been doing
business for the last eight months with a
[SPEAKER_02]: credit union in California, and they said
that this credit union has a don't ask,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't tell policy, and that's what it
seems to be working for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So generally, it's a lot tougher to get
financing from a bank, but you can play
[SPEAKER_07]: around, and you need some redundancy,
like have multiple bank accounts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's how most of us do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get shut down, you gotta have another
one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree, and I think credit unions are a
good option.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can get it, but I think this also
suggests that it's everyone's
[SPEAKER_03]: responsibility here to tell their friends
and everyone else to contact their U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: congressmen and senators about changing
the federal banking laws that allow this
[SPEAKER_03]: to be operated like any other regulated
business.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're paying the same taxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even more of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Guys, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dean Arbit, the rest of the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.
