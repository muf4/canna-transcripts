[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Kajem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladies and gentlemen, it's very nice to be
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to the ICDC, Alex and the team
for putting this together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a great show yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe all of us have been around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an absolute pleasure to talk a bit
more about adult use cannabis legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: models across Europe today.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Luke Richner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to represent CannaVigia,
but also to represent the Swiss industry
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of the parts and the approach
that we're having towards this
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization, if we can call it that
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: CannaVigia is a compliance,
track-and-trace software, see-to-sale,
[SPEAKER_01]: inspired by what the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you had Metric earlier today
being one of the first in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then looked at what Canada is doing
with the GS1 integration, with a more
[SPEAKER_01]: standardized global approach in the supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at different standards,
the new GNP, more consumer protection,
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer safety aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of all of that, we created a new
aspect, a new basis of a software that
[SPEAKER_01]: taps into all those different standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very proud to say that we were able
to secure a 10-year contract with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Swiss Health Ministry for the whole
track-and-trace of those pilot projects,
[SPEAKER_01]: the legalization models that I'll share a
little bit more about later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's enough about me to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have everybody introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Luke.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is JÃ¶rg Mayer-Brencken.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with Fluence Bioengineering.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm heading the cannabis sales department
in the Fluence and EMEA region,
[SPEAKER_05]: so you're in Middle East and Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: We supply lighting solutions to the
industry for greenhouses as well as indoor
[SPEAKER_05]: farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm based in Germany, but as I said,
working in Europe, Middle East and Africa,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I have a good overview of what's
going in the markets, how are they
[SPEAKER_05]: developed, what's the legislation in their
respective countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to talk obviously about Germany,
which is my home country, but also to
[SPEAKER_05]: shine a little bit or to shine light on
the other countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Luke, for being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Sonny Moenout, managing partner of
Cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out of the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always say I'm literally born in the
greenhouse, all my life already in the
[SPEAKER_02]: growing industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do, we help growers, investors in
making decisions how to set up a growing
[SPEAKER_02]: facility and also support them with
today's business in growing cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aldo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Aldo Medinha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the CEO of Stepwise Farming and
Engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a consultant more on the
pharmaceutical side, so I have 15 years
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was one of the co-founders of Second JP
License in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We provide consulting to pharmaceutical
industry and the medical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're involved in 14 projects at the
moment in Portugal and other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We deliver basically Turkey projects from
an idea from an investor to get the full
[SPEAKER_00]: deployment of the project and the
licensing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to be here and to discuss about
the adult use models here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Luke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, what we want to discuss a
little bit today, I mean, you've heard all
[SPEAKER_01]: about what is happening in different
countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to go too deep into those
different models.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all over a similar thing,
but we'll do a little introduction of just
[SPEAKER_01]: overarching what is happening in the
respective countries and then bring that a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit closer together and give some aspects
where we think maybe there could be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more thought process put into
some of those aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that momentum, let's call it like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll kick it off with Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're doing right now, we're
basically in a consultation mode,
[SPEAKER_01]: consultation situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it a pilot project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a nationwide study on how
legalization can be formulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of having five sessions and one of
them being open, we do five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be cut short, but we have a five
plus five year period where anyone that
[SPEAKER_01]: would like to show and think through a way
of legalization, they can submit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to submit that to the health
ministry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got to have all different
participants of the supply chain,
[SPEAKER_01]: every stakeholder involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then through that, after that,
through the basis of hard data,
[SPEAKER_01]: we then formulate a basis for a legal
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what I think we'll talk more about
later a little bit, but why don't I give
[SPEAKER_01]: it back into the round and you share a
little bit more about how it's approached
[SPEAKER_01]: in your area.
[SPEAKER_05]: We heard a lot about Germany yesterday
already.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're unlikely a few steps behind
Switzerland in Germany.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to find our way still.
[SPEAKER_05]: How can we make recreational cannabis
accessible to the people in Germany?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not defined yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will it be through pharmacies?
[SPEAKER_05]: Will it be through dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_05]: Will we even allow to grow plants at home?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which to my personal opinion would be
great as a grower that has access to a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: People like Sonja could help me grow
plants, but I think in general,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a difficult thing to grow cannabis
the right way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if I would allow for
everybody to grow at home, but this
[SPEAKER_05]: process just was kicked off.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hoping to get it to parliament next
year, beginning of next year and maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: have a decision end of the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still finding our way in Germany and
I think it's going to be an exciting path.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some kind of obligation to make
sure it goes or to bring our input as
[SPEAKER_05]: insiders from the industry to all the
politics, everybody who has a say on that,
[SPEAKER_05]: so we can make sure it's going the right
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking left and right I think is a good
idea because maybe Sonja, we want to take
[SPEAKER_05]: it up next for the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is another model that's also
interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see how that will go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah indeed, it's of course tolerated for
many many years in the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the backdoor policy we sometimes call
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that distribution model already
set up for years with the coffee shops and
[SPEAKER_02]: now finally a couple years ago the
government decided okay let's also from
[SPEAKER_02]: the growing side supply to the coffee
shops, let's organize that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it an experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have actually no idea why
it's called an experiment, but that is
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the single convention in 1961.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two exceptions, medicinal and
scientific purposes regarding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Netherlands don't want to be like
Uruguay and Canada where they of course
[SPEAKER_02]: fully legalize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be a brave kid within Europe
and we call it an experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now 10 growers have actually got the
permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can start production soon when
actually they know a bit more about the
[SPEAKER_02]: timeline when they can supply the coffee
shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually not all coffee shops,
so 10 municipalities in the Netherlands
[SPEAKER_02]: are part of the coffee shops experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a big cities like Amsterdam,
The Hague, Rotterdam, Utrecht,
[SPEAKER_02]: no it's smaller like the other bigger
cities in the south and the east.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the 10 growers can supply the 10 cities
and all the coffee shops in there and
[SPEAKER_02]: there will be a certain moment the
government will say to coffee shops you're
[SPEAKER_02]: only allowed from now on to buy from those
10 growers and that's how the experiment
[SPEAKER_02]: is organized.
[SPEAKER_02]: The drawing as it was actually was already
in December 2020 and still we have no
[SPEAKER_02]: grower really active and yeah being able
to sell and last week I was hearing that
[SPEAKER_02]: the growers themselves they are expecting
it will be actually Q4 2023 probably and
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah really looking forward when we
finally get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great for greenhouse cultivation right
another Q4 to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I forgot to mention I'm Portuguese so
we last year we had some movements to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize cannabis there was a couple of
parties that submitted some proposal of
[SPEAKER_00]: law in the Parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not approved it was delayed for
further discussion and with all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: situation with the war and all of that so
basically the priorities are elsewhere and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's expectations were that by 2023
a general law would be approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously despite this general law may be
approved until 2023 and there's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: no model yet we're trying to find our way
the same as Germany and there's always
[SPEAKER_00]: time to operationalize the law so you need
to give tools to your police to check that
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone has the maximum amount of the
limit that you have when you're driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of things that need to be
operationalized so despite the law may
[SPEAKER_00]: came out in 2023 there's a lot of things
that need to be done afterwards specific
[SPEAKER_00]: laws specific limits to how do you test it
and all of this will take my expectation
[SPEAKER_00]: will take at least two to three years to
make it actually available to people in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to find our way there's no
there's no yet an idea concrete idea of if
[SPEAKER_00]: it will be through pharmacies if it will
be through dispensaries if there will be a
[SPEAKER_00]: limit to the number of dispensaries if we
go that way that for people to open a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary there's still things to be done
I think across Europe it's not just the
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain has a has already a different model
they have the social clubs that were
[SPEAKER_00]: opened for protecting people that consume
drugs so that's one step at least to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect those people that already have
this consumption in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're making movements for the
medical cannabis the next step will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational let's hope it gets it's kept
there soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys so we heard a little bit
more about the different approaches some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the different models and I think our
main part here in the panel is also to
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge that a little bit we are in
Europe here so we all have seen what
[SPEAKER_01]: happened in other countries I don't want
to say they're all failed models but let's
[SPEAKER_01]: say that if you still have 80% black
market consumption after five to ten years
[SPEAKER_01]: depending where legalization then it's not
really what we're striving for in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: we also have a different kind of approach
I believe we are legal structure first and
[SPEAKER_01]: then business other countries are business
first and then legal structure so it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a great time for us to to assess what
happened around the world and and bring
[SPEAKER_01]: that into you know into different
formulations of how this can work actually
[SPEAKER_01]: not different formulations I think it has
to be very much a harmonized approach and
[SPEAKER_01]: this is one of the things that I'm very
much missing right now in Switzerland it
[SPEAKER_01]: took us four years we've been consulting
with the with the government the last two
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half years we were able to finally
and again yeah it's also a study it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: the full legalization because it doesn't
help anyone if you step outside of the law
[SPEAKER_01]: so you better create a study environment
that allows you to then move further once
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody else has figured out their
things but what I'm afraid right now is
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're going in the same direction
like some of the other countries and then
[SPEAKER_01]: we just go okay business first some of the
big companies here in Germany lobby in the
[SPEAKER_01]: back this this this and then in the end
you have a legal framework that works in a
[SPEAKER_01]: short term and if it does not work in the
long term we had in Switzerland 20 years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago we almost legalized and that was then
put on hold for another 20 years because
[SPEAKER_01]: we went too fast into it now I don't want
to say slow things down and I just want to
[SPEAKER_01]: say you know have a bit more of a wider
approach a bit more look at the different
[SPEAKER_01]: models but we see also right now right
Malta Malta is a non-for-profit
[SPEAKER_01]: organization that they're creating that
does the whole system of Malta under one
[SPEAKER_01]: roof and then disperses the money which is
also one of the workarounds and with all
[SPEAKER_01]: those different approaches right now is
that's what we discussed earlier also that
[SPEAKER_01]: if we do this now how do we then later
come to an actual industry at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the day it's time it's our the whole way
the European Union works it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: collaborative approach you should have to
know we have harmonized laws we have
[SPEAKER_01]: country overarching systems and I see now
different standards right Switzerland the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation is under GACP and organic
which we saw bound and so forth that was
[SPEAKER_01]: done for several reasons you always want
to have the farm lobby with you you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to have the big lobbies with you so you
have to find a stakeholder harmonized
[SPEAKER_01]: approach throughout and this is also one
of the things that we discussed what are
[SPEAKER_01]: the standards that you think we should
have for like cultivation that side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: supply chain of the earlier one that you
think would work across those different
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdictions do you want to take this one
out there I think it's yeah yeah so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's at the moment there's two
licensing in order to two approaches to
[SPEAKER_00]: guidelines to cultivation or to actually
the product one is product produced under
[SPEAKER_00]: GCP and product produced under GMP the GMP
is applicable to pharmaceutical standards
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's the approach that was defined for
the medical cannabis in Europe cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: is always done under GCP it's the further
processing that is then passes through to
[SPEAKER_00]: GMP for the adult hues I would think that
probably GCP would be would be more than
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to to assure that we have a product
that is safe for the consumer for the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical for the medical cannabis
obviously we need additional additional
[SPEAKER_00]: assurances to make sure that the product
is actually has a therapeutic effect and
[SPEAKER_00]: is effective to to the disease that is
that is tackling on the adult hues we're
[SPEAKER_00]: not ideally we're not looking for treating
a disease we're looking for just a having
[SPEAKER_00]: a recreational effect so I think probably
we're talking about something somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between GCP and and GMP closer to GCP just
to show that it is safe for a consumer to
[SPEAKER_00]: take this GCP is used for food products so
it should ensure that at least it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that is safe and that you
shouldn't be our pet obviously there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: compliment in that which is maximum amount
of THC on product maximum amount that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to have if you're driving so all of
these needs to be taken into consideration
[SPEAKER_00]: in addition to the quality of the product
that is insured by the GCP regulations
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe to add on that if you look to
growing vegetables and fruits is all about
[SPEAKER_02]: global gap having towards the GCP is just
a step further all because of consistency
[SPEAKER_02]: like all those said safety for actually
the end use of the product now as an
[SPEAKER_02]: example in the Dutch coffee shop you don't
know what you're buying actually and that
[SPEAKER_02]: has to change we need to go to a direction
that just as with your beer on the back
[SPEAKER_02]: side how much alcohol is in it that is
where we need to go to and then yeah your
[SPEAKER_02]: support helps as well to have that track
and trace and know where it is really
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from the product and that is what
we really missing now in the Dutch coffee
[SPEAKER_02]: shops and I think if you use towards GCP
you can track and trace it back and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can be sure that you buy actually a
certain amount of THC in your product
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer safety right and also protection
and at the moment we and anywhere that you
[SPEAKER_01]: buy in whichever form cannabis you have no
idea what's in there and anyone that has
[SPEAKER_01]: worked in the testing space anyone that
has worked with more standardization and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at the different chemicals are the
different mold is a big one right I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: half of the weed has mold in it and
recalls is one thing you have to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to do and it's not even just going over
the top about it it just I think global
[SPEAKER_01]: gap is absolutely fine but it can't be
that there is less traceability for weed
[SPEAKER_01]: or for whatever then there is for tomatoes
in your supermarket or for or for any kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of natural product absolutely today your
your teacher is traceable right to the
[SPEAKER_05]: source where it's been processed and
produced so why should this industry be
[SPEAKER_05]: any different from that and and I think
with all that also comes accessibility
[SPEAKER_05]: right you said they can buy the coffee
shop so there is an existing structure of
[SPEAKER_05]: where to buy it from in the Netherlands
and and this is going to be key also to
[SPEAKER_05]: fight the black market if you're in a
country area not in a big city you have to
[SPEAKER_05]: drive 20 25 kilometers to to shop or
nothing is available over the weekend then
[SPEAKER_05]: we open doors for the dealer that might
come just with a simple ping on Instagram
[SPEAKER_05]: in 10 minutes with a backpack to your
house so in order to to make it available
[SPEAKER_05]: we need to really think about the
distribution models we heard yesterday
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's be even an online thing that
you register I mean you can do all your
[SPEAKER_05]: bank transfers and businesses online after
having registered and make sure that's you
[SPEAKER_05]: doing the business so why should that be
possible with there with an online
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis career or whatever the structure
is like so I think that's very important
[SPEAKER_05]: that we think about that and make the
product really available for everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: convenience I think is a big word there
right convenience accessibility then that
[SPEAKER_01]: can come in different models right and
then then I'll take a quick side step into
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're doing in Switzerland right now
where yes it goes to the health ministry
[SPEAKER_01]: it has to sign it off but then it goes to
the municipalities and then you have you
[SPEAKER_01]: know the police has to be involved in some
ways then you have identifiers for the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are actually consumers but
they're not identifiers there's pseudonyms
[SPEAKER_01]: so you cannot actually link them to their
names and then you have different
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution models right we have in one
city for example they're looking at doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it the same way that there was a
government that in Switzerland you get
[SPEAKER_01]: methadone from a government facility that
is one approach then there's the approach
[SPEAKER_01]: of coffee shops of course coffee shops in
Switzerland there they will also be backed
[SPEAKER_01]: through at the moment the whole ordering
and quality control is still backed by a
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacy not meaning it has to be sold in
the pharmacy but just to have some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like quality standard on that part and
then we have the social clubs that also
[SPEAKER_01]: the purchasing and the guiding is done
with the qualified person and somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: always has to be in charge in the
beginning in the beginning right it can't
[SPEAKER_01]: just be a full or that's that's my humble
opinion it can't be full free flow yet and
[SPEAKER_01]: then working towards that so and then of
course there's also direct distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: online that they're looking at as you have
you can order your medicines online so
[SPEAKER_01]: with all those different approaches
there's not one that works for everywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's not just okay you have to go
and buy it there because then you go to
[SPEAKER_01]: your standard dealer that everybody's
going to or whoever you know and there I
[SPEAKER_01]: think this is one of the things that I
mentioned earlier with that consultation
[SPEAKER_01]: phase there's not one model that works
across one country there's even different
[SPEAKER_01]: models in different countries so now going
out and saying this is the way it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be will not help anyone right it will
not open it up it will actually more
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate that one side and that's another
part we're coming to in a minute you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate one side you have to find an
approach that works for everyone and bring
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole industry together and have
everybody that's in this room or out there
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to state and they have actually
have to have a voice in this because
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise everybody complains as usual in
this industry and nobody does anything and
[SPEAKER_05]: that doesn't bring us further we're also
complainers in general now but maybe I
[SPEAKER_05]: would like to give an example I work a lot
in Israel and Israel actually to me is a
[SPEAKER_05]: fascinating market we know they do a lot
of research and have never neglected the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole cannabis industry we're always
active and I would say they have a semi
[SPEAKER_05]: medical recreation market so they have
actually more medical patients as we have
[SPEAKER_05]: in Germany right now but being a country
ten times smaller shows how many you know
[SPEAKER_05]: what the market size is or the percentage
of people having access to let's say
[SPEAKER_05]: medical and safe cannabis and what I
wanted to say is the accessibility in
[SPEAKER_05]: Israel is amazing you can subscribe to the
pharmacy when you have your prescription
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously from the doctor and they send
you daily menus over whatsapp you see all
[SPEAKER_05]: the strains they have it's amazing it's
available it's there you can drive there
[SPEAKER_05]: right now or they will send it to you if
you're a registered person and you look at
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 different strains THC 10-15 different
strains and CBD balanced oils tinctures
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever and they send it to you every day
so you see the menu you can just order it
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's super accessible there is
transparency it's grouped in different THC
[SPEAKER_05]: level groups so this is something that I
know it's medical but I think it's because
[SPEAKER_05]: they don't have really developed a
recreational program yet this is some kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of a role model right now to me how
accessibility should look like and you
[SPEAKER_05]: mentioned earlier we don't want to have
kind of an American model where every
[SPEAKER_05]: state does its own thing and there is no
overarching let's say common sense and
[SPEAKER_05]: common rules you travel from Portugal to
the Netherlands to Germany will that even
[SPEAKER_05]: be allowed in the future if one of the
countries has legal access to recreation
[SPEAKER_05]: right now it's not you cannot buy in the
Netherlands and drive to Germany you're
[SPEAKER_05]: committing a crime actually so alignment
between the countries would be would be a
[SPEAKER_05]: very very appreciated thing I guess for
all of us here in the world I think what
[SPEAKER_02]: you were mentioning the different forms of
products in Israel also in Holland the big
[SPEAKER_02]: thing is actually the accessibility of
Harsh for example because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know that a big portion of what the
coffee shops are selling is actually this
[SPEAKER_02]: product and the product is actually coming
out of Morocco often so the accessibility
[SPEAKER_02]: to this same products as people are used
to get needs to be there and that is also
[SPEAKER_02]: a challenge for all the time growers where
to get this experience and people are
[SPEAKER_02]: really straightforward we also want to buy
in future that stuff from Morocco and that
[SPEAKER_02]: is different than what we know what's
happening in North America with Harsh
[SPEAKER_02]: Production that is not the same no it's
not the same it's a different different
[SPEAKER_01]: profile and actually the there's a reason
why it's only second-tier cities in
[SPEAKER_01]: Holland at the moment right the reason why
is because they're afraid of the gap that
[SPEAKER_01]: is left in the market of distribution of
supply in the first tier cities now I
[SPEAKER_01]: think you all can figure out yourself what
I'm talking about there and I think this
[SPEAKER_01]: is one of the big big issues that also
have to be addressed and tackled before we
[SPEAKER_01]: just do now okay let's make a model that
works we have big companies that make big
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities they all supply everyone yeah
yeah yeah and then after that you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: vacuum and usually a vacuum with people
that need to do something and if they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have anything to do they'll do
something else so this is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: has to be addressed that can be addressed
in different ways I mean there's there's
[SPEAKER_01]: different you know being there like you
give them a certain time you give them a
[SPEAKER_01]: chance to come forward a chance to you
know self
[SPEAKER_01]: good question I don't know all right like
an amnesty program right we're giving time
[SPEAKER_01]: to come from from stepping out at the dark
so to say come forward in front of the law
[SPEAKER_05]: and say come forward in the past and now
your record could be cleared exactly and
[SPEAKER_01]: create the point zero then move forward
and then like that have them part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall industry this is I think for me
that's something nobody talks about
[SPEAKER_01]: because needless to say this has been a
long this has been around for a very long
[SPEAKER_01]: time and I was very happy to be part of
the consultation process here in Germany a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of weeks ago here in Berlin and
gentlemen from from Holland that organized
[SPEAKER_01]: all the coffee shows one of the coffee
shop associations like how can we bring
[SPEAKER_01]: the Moroccan hash back because the people
will want that actually if it's not there
[SPEAKER_01]: they will just go around it so I'd say
there's a lot of more homework to be done
[SPEAKER_01]: is what I want to say with that not that
I'm saying I will print or any one of us I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to be the one that has to make
the blueprint but I'm definitely here to
[SPEAKER_01]: speak up and put up my voice and I think
everybody should also do that in their
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity and not just be one on the
outside and just say no no no this is not
[SPEAKER_01]: good it's not that's completely open it's
completely run around and you know I I
[SPEAKER_01]: just want to say there's a bit more
homework to be done in my opinion we need
[SPEAKER_05]: to close these gaps all right
accessibility supply chain variability in
[SPEAKER_05]: the product is very important and although
you said earlier that ideally people in
[SPEAKER_05]: the recreational market don't buy for
disease treatment but let's face it there
[SPEAKER_05]: are so many people that do it right now
and they don't even buy from the wreck
[SPEAKER_05]: they buy from the legal market and they
may have found their hash that works for
[SPEAKER_05]: them so if you change all that we know how
how important the very composition of the
[SPEAKER_05]: strain is to if you have found it for
yourself for your energy and the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoid system to be received and if
you change all that you lose these these
[SPEAKER_00]: patients these consumers yeah control over
the supply chain I think it's the it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: key to all this and it doesn't depend on a
country to legalize the attitudes it
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on if there's a Morocco ash that
comes from from this country then you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to legalize it there and have the in place
controls that make sure that the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: is there that you're because this is not
going to matter we don't test the tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: for an API for an active ingredients we
put to test canvas we need to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: specification in place it means that you
have a specification there's this still
[SPEAKER_00]: applies it doesn't it doesn't mean that
you like lack of control so if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: this standardized across the world ideally
if you have this these standards comply
[SPEAKER_00]: with each country and it is regulated and
control in that country then we will have
[SPEAKER_00]: better control over this and well at the
moment is the UN that controls the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: basically that the supply chain in the
world and make sure that we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: loss of control or theft of control
substance so this is not one country to
[SPEAKER_00]: decide we need to learn from each other I
think Europe has a lot to learn from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes made in Canada from what's been
implemented in the US I think there's good
[SPEAKER_00]: things there's things that we need to
learn from and improve and we cannot shut
[SPEAKER_00]: our eyes to what others have done because
otherwise we won't learn from it and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: make the same mistakes so yeah it's it's
important that we learn from some models I
[SPEAKER_00]: think having the adult use for instance
having having some kind of description
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in a dispensary I've just came
from came from from the US I've been in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary there and there was a
dispensary that had basically the product
[SPEAKER_00]: was ordered on a table and a tablet inside
the called the inside the dispensary and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a description of the product
that was evaluation on what it did for you
[SPEAKER_00]: from a focus point of view from a sleep
point of view if it is energetic if it is
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that so if you can have
this at least this information for the
[SPEAKER_00]: public I think information is key for this
because you don't know what you're buying
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not just a THC or CBD it's
the whole components of the of the of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it's the flavonoids it's the
terpenes and everything will come along
[SPEAKER_00]: and give you a different a different
sensation and different experience when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're when you're smoking it or vaping it
or whatever we're doing with it so I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's important to give also this
information to the to the consumers so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they know what to expect and they can
choose what's actually there they're
[SPEAKER_05]: pushed that's something that we're
discussing internally all the time is that
[SPEAKER_05]: we are all from the industry we have a
good idea what what product could do to us
[SPEAKER_05]: but if we want to win people that are not
consumers that and yet and we want we want
[SPEAKER_05]: to create accessibility and transparency
for them it's like with wines right on the
[SPEAKER_05]: back it's written it complements with
certain foods it has it has this in that
[SPEAKER_05]: taste and if you yeah so if you want to
make a wine choice they give you some
[SPEAKER_05]: options and hints what you if you're even
if you're not an expert what you what you
[SPEAKER_05]: can choose and and I think also we need a
kind of a traffic sign or or taste wheel
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of easy graph on product or in the
stores that describe the actual yeah power
[SPEAKER_05]: of the product that way right so this is
extremely important to open the market for
[SPEAKER_05]: other user groups I guess and create a
standardization throughout right I mean I
[SPEAKER_01]: think this should be the same in every
country yeah exactly like sugar content in
[SPEAKER_01]: food exactly like now we have sugar
content coming up yeah it's a big thing
[SPEAKER_01]: people have got a lot of sugar there's a
lot of a lot of issues coming out of that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have it with alcohol you have beer that
has a certain percentage of a certain tax
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you have wine that has a higher
percentage of a higher tax that's how you
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally also can kind of guide the
consumer towards a more softer consumption
[SPEAKER_01]: and well outside of all of that what a
form form in you guys opinion now we've
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about what Europe has been doing we
talked a little bit about the outside
[SPEAKER_01]: approaches and we don't want to say that
the US and Canada did everything wrong not
[SPEAKER_01]: at all they were frontrunners a lot of
pioneering a lot of AB testing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: you know cowboy mentality and a lot of
business first approach which has it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very rightful place within within an
industry I think anyone that comes from
[SPEAKER_01]: more economical background sometimes
envies that the business first approach in
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time we also like slow and steady
and I believe still slow and steady wins
[SPEAKER_01]: the race are there in your opinions any
key learnings that we should take from
[SPEAKER_01]: outside because actually this panel has
been put together a little bit also with
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody that is sitting here has
expensive extensive experience outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe but they're working from Europe to
the outside and from the different aspects
[SPEAKER_01]: of it what have you seen the outside that
you think we should take and that could
[SPEAKER_02]: work on our grounds actually I want to
dive back to the cultivation side of
[SPEAKER_02]: things because that's where it all starts
and if you look to the coffee shop in
[SPEAKER_02]: Holland you have a way how to get product
to the consumers but at this moment you
[SPEAKER_02]: have like a virtual integrated company
they all need to be so you need to have
[SPEAKER_02]: their own mothers propagation but why are
we so big in the in the growing industry
[SPEAKER_02]: in the Netherlands because we have
specialists for propagation who do all the
[SPEAKER_02]: cloning we have growers and then we have
more towards post harvest now they need to
[SPEAKER_02]: do all so you need to actually build a
company with four different companies
[SPEAKER_02]: within the company and I think when
implementation of the everything regarding
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational cannabis they should not
forget about the growing part and make
[SPEAKER_02]: make it possible that growers can buy
rooted clones from other companies because
[SPEAKER_02]: that is what is lacking now as well in
many countries they need to do all but
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah it is something special and you
cannot do everything really well without
[SPEAKER_01]: me wanting to be too much commercial at
this stage but this is exactly what we are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to tackle for my company we look at
all these countries that the companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that are completely vertically integrated
and that's not an economically viable
[SPEAKER_01]: system right usually in any other industry
you have specialist in different parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: the supply chain and then you have to work
with each other but because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hardship of the regulatory non-existent or
less existing framework you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: completely vertically integrated companies
which doesn't make the most efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't make them specialists so we
believe through full transparency
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the whole supply chain you can
break that vertical integration into what
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to say more of a horizontal
integration you can still have quality
[SPEAKER_01]: control you can still have batch release
systems you can still have COAs at every
[SPEAKER_01]: stage of the production and therefore
actually then also consumer protection in
[SPEAKER_01]: the end but you can allow the clones to be
done by the best clone manufacturer
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator cultivation done by the
specialist in that then it goes to you
[SPEAKER_01]: know a manufacturer that is specifically
just the big manufacturers in pharma or in
[SPEAKER_01]: actually all the other food products
they're called contract manufacturers they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't produce their own products they
produce for everyone else and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: another big thing that I believe we have
to break up I see Michelle stood up there
[SPEAKER_01]: so is this the time Michelle for us to ask
some questions from the audience yes
[SPEAKER_01]: please shot like always
[SPEAKER_04]: let's hear it again for my question is
like about the supply chains and the
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization process in Germany so right
now the biggest community pharmacy
[SPEAKER_04]: organization like the only one talks to
the government actually has an impact says
[SPEAKER_04]: we can help you with the dispension if we
legalize but only if we do like it in
[SPEAKER_04]: community pharmacies only because that's
the only way the only way we can we can
[SPEAKER_04]: save the check and trace process and with
your experience what do you think about
[SPEAKER_05]: this statement about this approach I'm not
a hundred percent sure about the question
[SPEAKER_05]: so that the the track and trace is only
applicable when there is certain
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries from the network no no the
community pharmacists in Germany say we
[SPEAKER_04]: can take care about the dispension but
only if the dispension only works
[SPEAKER_04]: throughout pharmacies because that's the
only way we can take care about the supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain well that is of course because they
want to keep their interests and have a
[SPEAKER_01]: strong lobby group there which is their
rightful thing to do but there are
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions out there like for example mine
or other ones that actually exactly are
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicated to break this up you can move
between different companies between
[SPEAKER_01]: different dispensing models and still have
a full traceability fully you know
[SPEAKER_01]: integral supply chain without any product
leaving from one side or the other or any
[SPEAKER_01]: product entering the supply chain so this
is of course a statement that was brought
[SPEAKER_01]: in there from from one to strong lobby
groups which I believe very much are
[SPEAKER_01]: important to all have within and not to
fight against this next few stages because
[SPEAKER_01]: the more you have all stakeholders
involved and happy and behind it the
[SPEAKER_01]: sooner we can move towards the next
station for the next just just to add I
[SPEAKER_05]: think personally that we shouldn't neglect
an existing network of pharmacies that we
[SPEAKER_05]: have as specialists I think it's it's the
lowest hurdle to train these people also
[SPEAKER_05]: on the consumption and application of not
only medical but also recreational
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis so it would be in my opinion not
wise to exclude that and try to
[SPEAKER_05]: differentiate or make a hard cut between
the recreation of the medical dispension
[SPEAKER_05]: of cannabis because that network exists
it's all over and it's even in small rural
[SPEAKER_05]: areas usually you have a pharmacy so so
again accessibility and professional
[SPEAKER_05]: advice which is part of the of the
proposal for law in Germany that you need
[SPEAKER_05]: a trained person which I think it's a very
very good thing and we should obviously do
[SPEAKER_05]: that so yeah and I hope that answers your
question a little bit it's part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: convenience and I must say I'm interested
to see a pharmacist help someone that's
[SPEAKER_05]: new to cannabis to show how to apply the
cannabis so if he's buying a flower will
[SPEAKER_05]: the pharmacist help him or rolling a joint
packing the pipe I don't know but it's got
[SPEAKER_03]: to be interesting good morning Matt
Dickinson from Clarion cannabis indoor
[SPEAKER_03]: small batch cultivation in Portugal
question for you guys and thanks to the
[SPEAKER_03]: panel as we move into legalization or
adult use what do you think we'll see
[SPEAKER_03]: dropped in terms of the GMP to GCP
restrictions and do you think we'll see
[SPEAKER_03]: any changes to that at all the question so
as we move from legalization we're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: from medical or to adult use do you think
that we're going to see some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: restrictions that we currently have with
GMP dropped and move more into a GCP model
[SPEAKER_03]: or do you think those restrictions were
specifically with to do with the microbial
[SPEAKER_03]: counts consistency product registration
labeling things like that you think we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see those dropped or relaxed from adult
use point of view in a consumer point of
[SPEAKER_00]: view part of those restrictions probably
will fall the specification side it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: question of safety so I don't think it
will vary it too much the specification
[SPEAKER_00]: that you get from GCP from the GCP part on
the labeling on the type of packaging that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use eventually there will be some
variation but bear in mind that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is being used for equivalent to food grade
materials so specifications on materials
[SPEAKER_00]: should be probably the same won't vary it
much the only thing I see is the labeling
[SPEAKER_00]: that can have different information
because you're not treating an ailment
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about the regression in use
so I think I think it will become much
[SPEAKER_01]: more accessible and then all the
conversations that I was part of was to
[SPEAKER_01]: lower those barriers without losing the
quality control and the traceability and
[SPEAKER_01]: all of those aspects so I think the life
for a craft cultivator is going to become
[SPEAKER_01]: easier never because it shouldn't be easy
I don't think it should be easy but it
[SPEAKER_01]: will become more accessible thank you
thank you so very much we're actually out
[SPEAKER_02]: of time let's hear it once again all right
you you
