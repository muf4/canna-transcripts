[SPEAKER_00]: Canada is helping lead the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot what you're going to experience in
Germany, what we're going to experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada is really leading the way and
experiencing the ups and downs and
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities, obstacles, hurdles ahead of
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this panel will be providing some great
opportunities to learn from people that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been through early stages everybody's
going to go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to introduce the moderator.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll take care of the rest of the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He joined Med Relief in 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he is the director of partner
development for a new licensed producer
[SPEAKER_00]: called Flower out of British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please give a warm welcome to Mr. Alex
Revich.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome to be back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get our panel up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: First, I want to say, Willkommen Danka f√ºr
Erscheinen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that OK?
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a little practice from last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great to be back for my second time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year was an awesome show,
and I can already tell this is going to be
[SPEAKER_08]: even a better show.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has been already, and it's not over
yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to give a special thanks to
Alex Rogers and the organizers of ICBC.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can give a quick round of applause for
Alex and ICBC and everything he's done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before I introduce this awesome group of
panelists, I want to give everyone a brief
[SPEAKER_08]: history of Canada to put a little context
into how we've come to where we are.
[SPEAKER_08]: It all started back in around 1999 when
the first people started using cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of them were HIV patients from
Toronto, where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kind of describe it, if anyone's
seen the movie Dallas Buyers Club.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if anyone's seen it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, you should probably check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really, the story is people wanted to
use it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was helping them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the government said, you know,
let's do some more research on this,
[SPEAKER_08]: and we'll tell you if this is good.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said, we don't have time.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're dying.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need this right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they fought it up to the Supreme Court,
and the Supreme Court gave them the right
[SPEAKER_08]: to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they said, where am I supposed to buy
this cannabis from?
[SPEAKER_08]: So they said, OK, we'll let you grow it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of people can't grow their own
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if you heard.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not as easy as a lot of people think.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they allowed someone else to grow it
for them as a designated grower,
[SPEAKER_08]: which had some issues with it,
with some designated growers growing a
[SPEAKER_08]: couple extra plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: By a couple extra plants, I mean a few
thousand plants extra.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're making a little money on the
side.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that program died.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was called MMAR.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in 2014, they introduced MMPR,
medical marijuana for purposes of medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that allowed for licensed producers to
sell the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there wasn't enough cannabis at the
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they allowed both programs to run
simultaneously until 2016, when ACMPR,
[SPEAKER_08]: Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes
Regulations, ACMPR, allows for licensed
[SPEAKER_08]: producers and people to grow for their own
and for cannabis oils, which were
[SPEAKER_08]: introduced in 2016.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just to give you a quick little
snapshot of our industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I started about five years ago,
there was less than 100 doctors
[SPEAKER_08]: prescribing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We now have over 11,000 doctors
prescribing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So your challenge is about doctors not
prescribing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know.
[SPEAKER_08]: We feel it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some thoughts on why that is and
how you can overcome it, which we'll talk
[SPEAKER_08]: about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, we currently have around 400,000
patients and over 30 licensed sellers of
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis and over almost 100 licensees.
[SPEAKER_08]: But a lot of those licensees are owned by
some cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't be fooled.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that there's 100 separate
companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some companies have multiple licenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just some market data.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's around 2,000 kilograms a month
sold.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is from December from Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing we're very lucky that Health
Canada provides us stats and data,
[SPEAKER_08]: where I know in Germany, there's a lot of
challenges to find out what the
[SPEAKER_08]: information is on how much is going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Canada, they're giving it to us.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little outdated, but it's better
than nothing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So from December, around 2,000 kilograms a
month sold and 3,000 kilograms of oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Around 114,000 shipments are done a month
in December.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're busy gearing up for legalization
and exporting it and all that kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because as of December, there was 38,000
kilograms in inventory.
[SPEAKER_08]: So definitely lots in inventory and 11,000
kilograms of oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: The average script size is about 2.4
grams.
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone was asking me the other day what
the average script size.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to let everyone know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about 2.4 grams.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, really excited to introduce these
panelists over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got a great panel who know a lot about
business.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start with the first panel.
[SPEAKER_08]: The founder of Emblem, one of my good
friends, Max Abbott.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great to be back in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was here last year for the ICBC
conference.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's great to see that it's back this
year and it's growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's still a lot of interest in
this market, especially what's gone on
[SPEAKER_07]: with some of the German regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quickly about Emblem, we're a publicly
traded company in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been licensed since 2015.
[SPEAKER_07]: Started trading on the TSX-V in 2016.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have three main verticals.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Emblem Health that seeks to focus
on medical and novel-like dosage forms
[SPEAKER_07]: that are more akin to pharmaceutical
products like oral sprays, tablets,
[SPEAKER_07]: oils, gel caps.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Emblem Rec that we're launching,
which will service the recreational market
[SPEAKER_07]: in Canada with a house of brands.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we also have a key component with that
through our educational arm called
[SPEAKER_07]: GrowWise, which provides a nexus between
the patients and healthcare professionals
[SPEAKER_07]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Max.
[SPEAKER_08]: Next on our panel is Phil Campbell.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the CEO of Ascent Industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Alex.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to see such a great turnout
here in Berlin at the ICBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the CEO of Ascent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ascent is a global cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're focused on the emerging cannabis
opportunity in any market that has a
[SPEAKER_02]: regulated opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're licensed in Canada, Oregon,
and Nevada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're pursuing licensing in a number
of other markets as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We focus on consumer experiences and
creating brand loyalty and connection with
[SPEAKER_02]: our consumers to create brand value with
the products that we sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do that all backed in science.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a number of scientists,
15 scientists on staff, and we do
[SPEAKER_02]: everything with validated proper
methodologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are pursuing a public listing in the
next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We look forward to entering the German
market in the years ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Phil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the next person I can tell you in
Canada would need no introduction.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's quite a well-known figure in the
Canadian cannabis industry for many,
[SPEAKER_08]: many years.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's currently the CEO of Ween Income,
and he does many other things,
[SPEAKER_08]: which I'm sure he'll tell you about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chuck Ruffici.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Alex.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Chuck Ruffici, some might know me as
the co-founder of Canopy Growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, it's a very exciting industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: With Ween Income, companies started less
than a year ago, partnered with arguably
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the other industry experts in
Canada, top regulatory firm and lawyers,
[SPEAKER_03]: and really looked at how we could innovate
the production platform, really been
[SPEAKER_03]: building out and putting shovel to ground
on a lot of production capacity in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're moving on to IP creation,
kind of mainstream value, and now looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at distribution deals internationally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we still have some catching up on the
production side, but we're really excited
[SPEAKER_03]: about the global market and working to
build out the Wheaton production platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also chairman of National Access Cannabis,
which was one of the first four companies
[SPEAKER_03]: to get a private retailing license in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, through private equity from
Nesta, we've launched a European fund
[SPEAKER_03]: targeting institutional investors to
invest in ancillary businesses in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot's going on, a lot of excitement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great to be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Chuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, as everyone told you,
I'm Alex Ruffici.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm with a company called Flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're a grower out of Kelowna,
BC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to be, hopefully, importing here to
Germany for our GMP facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm very focused on education,
which has been a theme last year and this
[SPEAKER_08]: year, and created an education program.
[SPEAKER_08]: So welcome to come and talk to me about
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you're not here to talk about
education right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're talking about business and how to
make money, and you've got some of the
[SPEAKER_08]: best people to talk to about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I promise I'm going to leave time for
questions, because I think that's really
[SPEAKER_08]: important.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure a lot of you already have some
questions, and maybe some more after this
[SPEAKER_08]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first question we're going to talk
about are, what are some of the early
[SPEAKER_08]: challenges, and how are we able to
overcome it in Canada?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to start us off, Max?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, challenges, of course,
regulation, which is something everybody
[SPEAKER_07]: in Germany is clearly aware of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Money is a challenge, although the notion
now that in Canada, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: money.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's no problem to raise money.
[SPEAKER_07]: But still, you need to have a really solid
business in order to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the early days, when the market was
just developing, and it was medical only,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was under conservative government,
there were times where it was extremely
[SPEAKER_07]: difficult to raise money and to build
these very capital-intensive facilities
[SPEAKER_07]: that required a lot of capital
expenditure, as well as operational
[SPEAKER_07]: expenditure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are definitely the two biggest
challenges.
[SPEAKER_07]: That are going to be happening in this
German market, as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Phil, Chuck, any thoughts?
[SPEAKER_07]: Phil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the two biggest challenges that
are dealing with the regulator and also
[SPEAKER_02]: access to capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as you enter into the German
market, some of the things that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to want to do is to really educate
yourself on the process, really go through
[SPEAKER_02]: the regulations front to back,
and understand everything very thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And get consultants, if you need to,
in order to make sure you have a full
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And get in front of it early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your application in early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Work with the regulator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Create a very friendly relationship with
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And always make sure that you have access
to capital, because that is a very
[SPEAKER_02]: capital-intensive project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, kind of echoing thoughts,
it's really neat to embrace the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations, as we know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think getting out early,
being a first mover, early mover,
[SPEAKER_03]: means you're going to deal with a lot more
uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think this industry rewards early
movers far greater than anything else I've
[SPEAKER_03]: seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it'll always be worth the
additional trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the regulatory bar always increases
over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Becoming a licensed producer, when we
filed in 2013, was far easier than it is
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the application gets deeper as the
regulator learns how to process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's certainly key.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that kind of comes down to kind of the
main point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the challenge is that you've got
to remember the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the opportunity is a great
business opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a political issue, above all
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And politics will often trump good policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you don't embrace this political
mix to this, the calculus, then you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent point.
[SPEAKER_08]: And even on the regulatory thing,
just to point out, we were here last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: The tender for Germany just came out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was a lot of excitement.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in Canada, even though it seems pretty
perfect from an outside world,
[SPEAKER_08]: here we are five years later, I can assure
you, when the regulations first came out,
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of people were quite upset and
threatened to sue the government.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we went through the same challenges.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just takes time to expand.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here we are five years later.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you mentioned about raising money.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very hot topic right now with so
many publicly traded companies here
[SPEAKER_08]: listing in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's even some American companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to give you some stats from
Bloomberg, as of January, there were 84
[SPEAKER_08]: publicly traded companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was worth around $37 billion as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: US companies are now listing in Canada
because Canada allows for cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: listings, although Frankfurt as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a lot of American companies
and even one Canadian company,
[SPEAKER_08]: which got listed on the NASDAQ.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just want to point out, it is a good
time to buy.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are at a four-month low.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not going to ask these guys which
companies they recommend to buy,
[SPEAKER_08]: since a couple of them are public and one
might be soon as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we will talk about what are some of
the challenges of going public and how do
[SPEAKER_08]: you know when the right time is to go
public?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think when Tweed was the first
company to be publicly traded in Canada,
[SPEAKER_03]: the TSX Venture Exchange, and the time
that we did it was actually our thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: was because of the advertising
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do it for capital reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the whole industry at that time
underestimated the capital requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did it more for publicity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you'll advertise your public
company, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an advantage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, luckily, we had a vehicle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many other companies now in Canada are
public.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think obviously the opportunity is
having a currency and being able to move
[SPEAKER_03]: fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of the speed of the industry,
I think it disproportionately rewards
[SPEAKER_03]: people with access to public funds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the challenges are,
with that, you do get constrained.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a challenge in Canada for
publicly traded companies, at least on the
[SPEAKER_03]: TSX Venture and the TSX, is that we can't
play in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a tremendous amount of deal
flow and opportunities that we see in the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States that we can't touch,
that other competitors can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's interesting to see how that
develops.
[SPEAKER_03]: But certainly, the global market is
providing a great counterbalance to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say if you're pursuing a
public listing, the biggest thing now with
[SPEAKER_02]: 84 public companies, and there's a few
more in the pipeline by the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: year, it'll be over 100, is to ensure that
you have something that really
[SPEAKER_02]: differentiates your story from other
cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to be just another story
amongst a sea of stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have something compelling for
investors to believe in and to put their
[SPEAKER_02]: money behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to have a business that's
just a generic cannabis company with just
[SPEAKER_02]: hopes and dreams.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have something tangible,
something real that investors can get
[SPEAKER_02]: behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's the biggest thing if
you're pursuing a listing now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Phil, anyone else going public on the
stage soon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're in the process of going
public.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be listed in June on the CSC.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Chuck mentioned, we do have assets in
the United States, so we have to pursue a
[SPEAKER_02]: listing on the CSC rather than some of the
other exchanges.
[SPEAKER_08]: He gets to all the fun opportunities.
[SPEAKER_08]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Max, some thoughts on going public?
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, when I started Emblem back in 2013,
not in my wildest imaginations that I
[SPEAKER_07]: think we're going to have to be a publicly
traded company or that a cannabis company
[SPEAKER_07]: can even be a publicly traded company,
let alone.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess I was a bit naive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason you do go public,
of course, is to provide your investors
[SPEAKER_07]: with liquidity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you're raising money and the
amount of money that you have to raise for
[SPEAKER_07]: this space, in order to build out your
cultivation facilities and your
[SPEAKER_07]: operations, you need to give back to the
investors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why you do go public.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you don't have to and you can stay
private, I mean, I personally would rather
[SPEAKER_07]: do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also understand the need for going
public and why Canadian companies and
[SPEAKER_07]: other companies are doing so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some of the race, I think the fear
that even as a publicly traded Canadian
[SPEAKER_03]: company, having that currency access to
capital, I mean, the top 10 Canadian
[SPEAKER_03]: companies are raising 100 million Canadian
just kind of every now and then when the
[SPEAKER_03]: market conditions are right, not in the
last couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the real fear for me is the US has
given the Canadian industry a huge gift
[SPEAKER_03]: through the illegality at a federal level.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that will eventually change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see a former Speaker of the House
kind of endorsing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once the institutional taps open in
the US, we're going to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we always feel the urgency,
I think, to continue scaling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because although we've had a great amount
of scaling that's taken place,
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry globally is still in its
infancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's still a race.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the challenge and the
opportunity for everybody here is that
[SPEAKER_03]: although Canadian companies have,
I think, a great start, it's still really
[SPEAKER_03]: early.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just on that note, everyone always
talks about going public as just a license
[SPEAKER_08]: to print money and there's all this
excitement around it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can anyone just touch on a few challenges?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what are the negatives?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if anyone's really thinking like,
oh, it's all great, if anything you
[SPEAKER_08]: publicly talk about of, hey, it might not
be as sweet as you think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, once you go public, you're under the
microscope.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have shareholders and you have
shareholders from all walks of life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you have a lot of retail investors
that are just looking to make money and
[SPEAKER_07]: flip your stock.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they don't understand that everything
takes time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're trying to build a real business
at Emblem.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do have a real business.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have great products coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have great marketing and branding.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it may not be reflective of our share
price, while there are other companies who
[SPEAKER_07]: have higher valuations that don't have a
nickel in sales.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to take it with a grain of
salt.
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously, being under that
microscope, a lot of people contact myself
[SPEAKER_07]: and our CEO and sometimes leave us nasty
emails about things.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's just because they don't
understand what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're not taking the time to really
understand the industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're just looking to make a quick
buck.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's an excellent point.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if anyone else has to add.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think some of the considerations
are obviously the transparency of being
[SPEAKER_02]: under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also that there's a significant cost
associated with it, not just to finance
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just a financial cost,
but also a human capital cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot of resources in order to
pursue a public listing and maintain that
[SPEAKER_02]: listing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that does put a burden on the
management team.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are able to stay private and
access capital, and your shareholders are
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable with that, then that's
certainly something worth considering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it allows the management team to
focus more on the business and less on the
[SPEAKER_02]: public aspect of the business,
which is itself a separate business
[SPEAKER_02]: entirely almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So certainly something to consider is if
you can't stay private, it does give you
[SPEAKER_02]: more flexibility to pivot and stay
private.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can stay nimble in the industry,
which is a terribly complex one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's lots of emerging
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having that flexibility could be
beneficial for some companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think you see the check sizes on
private deals getting larger with more
[SPEAKER_03]: global interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think you can stay private a little
bit longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But certainly I think our experience,
and soon your experience, is given the
[SPEAKER_03]: speed at which the industry is evolving,
I still believe that the default choice is
[SPEAKER_03]: to try to access the capital markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you do that, you need to scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no point in going public and not
having a subsequent raise.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going public.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're taking on that burden.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to scale probably by another
factor of 10 to make that gamble worth it
[SPEAKER_03]: and sometimes lose control of your board.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent points.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can tell you, for the longest time,
every time I go somewhere, people would
[SPEAKER_08]: love to ask me a question about cannabis
use, what's good for my grandmother,
[SPEAKER_08]: or what strain or variety I'd recommend.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I used to love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But now a lot of times I tell them what
industry I'm in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're like, oh, what stock should I
invest in?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it gets kind of annoying that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I can't imagine what it's like for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a party.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_08]: I invested in you yesterday, and I'm down.
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell is going on?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you can't recommend your own stocks.
[SPEAKER_08]: I say buy his.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was on a family vacation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I made the error of tweeting it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got a tweet response from someone,
I guess, who is a shareholder and said,
[SPEAKER_07]: how can you be taking vacation when your
stock is on its way down?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, jeez.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are harsh, very harsh.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the best lesson for this is
that it's a long game.
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone said yesterday, and I say the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a marathon.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a race.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you bought something, hoping that
you're going to sell it tomorrow,
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think any of these guys have any
tears for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more of like a long-term game.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you believe in the business,
you invest, and you hold on until it comes
[SPEAKER_08]: to fruition.
[SPEAKER_08]: So some excellent points.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the last question before we get into
your questions is about other cool
[SPEAKER_08]: businesses that you like.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all kinds of different ancillary
products on the side.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not only about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you probably have heard this
expression.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you haven't, it's used a lot in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they talk about the miners.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it wasn't only the miners that were
getting the gold that made a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the businesses that supported them,
like the jeans, the picks, the shovels.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a very common expression.
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe we can take a moment to just talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can start it off.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw there was a cool business that buys
up land and leases it back.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a few companies that plant
properties and a few.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a big vaporizer guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one I really like out of Canada
called Airizer.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to come check it out,
come up to me after.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been showing it off all this time in
Berlin.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are some cool side businesses,
other things that support cannabis that
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe you guys can talk about some of
the things that excite you and give them a
[SPEAKER_08]: little insight scoop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: At Emblem, although cultivation is a big
part of what we do, we're actually
[SPEAKER_07]: reshifting our focus away from cultivation
and into more of the value-add products,
[SPEAKER_07]: derivatives and concentrates and
pharmaceutical-like products.
[SPEAKER_07]: As well, we're focusing on brands,
because that's where the higher margins
[SPEAKER_07]: are going to exist.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimately, cultivation, as more and more
operations come online, the price of those
[SPEAKER_07]: operations are going up, but the price of
the product is ultimately going down.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there are tons of ancillary
businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even as a licensed producer who
produces cannabis products, you have to
[SPEAKER_07]: think beyond just cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's an excellent point.
[SPEAKER_02]: For us, what we're focused on now is
taking what we've learned on the small to
[SPEAKER_02]: medium scale and some of the smaller
markets like Oregon and Nevada and
[SPEAKER_02]: industrializing those processes and using
automation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking things that are done
semi-automatically using some vape pen
[SPEAKER_02]: fillers and other automated processes,
but combining them so that it's fully
[SPEAKER_02]: automated so that you can actually access
a truly national and international market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking something that's been done in
Oregon, it's only 4 million people,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you can't really justify the expense of
putting in a fully automated packaging
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas in Canada, there's 37 million
people, we have the opportunity to export.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our focus now moving into the next
year is automating the processing so that
[SPEAKER_02]: we can truly create large volumes of
products to be able to service that
[SPEAKER_02]: national and international opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's going to be something
that really differentiates us as we move
[SPEAKER_02]: forward, because a lot of companies are
focused on large-scale cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities, which we're also doing
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a 60,000 square meter greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have a 4,000 square meter
manufacturing facility, and that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to really enable us to create millions of
units a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that I'm excited about as
far as technology or as far as emerging
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities is in technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've invested into an enterprise
resource planning software.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it tracks all of the different costs
and other metrics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything that happens in our business
gets put into this dashboard and scrubs
[SPEAKER_02]: all the information and presents it in a
very user-friendly interface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have real-time business intelligence
to make sensible decisions with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that database, as it continues to grow
and build, will allow us to take that
[SPEAKER_02]: information and be able to enter new
markets in a more timely manner with more
[SPEAKER_02]: sophistication and more information behind
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the things that we're excited
about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Chuck, I know you've got lots of
things to be excited about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, I mean, I think a specific
ancillary product that I like is the data
[SPEAKER_03]: that we now see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I showed it to a company that I'm
a customer of, BDS Analytics out of
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have great market segmentation by
brand, by SKU.
[SPEAKER_03]: They charge well for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's great data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you look to develop your own
products and attack the market,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's great sources like that
developing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think the value is in brands
over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my thesis is that right now,
you can have the best brand in the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: the best consumption device or product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But unless you have the input materials to
create that product, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people that control brands today are
the ones that have cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we know that that will shift.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you see a lot of the current people
with a lot of production shifting to
[SPEAKER_03]: licensing IP or creating IP to create that
brand value.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're kind of shifting,
I think, in Canada to most companies have
[SPEAKER_03]: the cultivation that they want or at least
that they want to have kind of in the
[SPEAKER_03]: queue being built.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's about where they're going to
put that cultivation to get higher
[SPEAKER_03]: margins.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a huge fan of vape pens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that'd be the most important
segment in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some jurisdictions aren't allowing it yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada, we don't know when it'll come.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's an amazing consumption
device.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the biggest threat to
alcohol, in my view.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are talking about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just a quick technology, since you
were mentioning technology, there's a
[SPEAKER_08]: company I know that me and Emblem work
with called Strain Print.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what they do is they analyze people's
results from the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it makes it a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_08]: It picks all the data, puts it together.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it makes it easier for other
people to decide what strains are right
[SPEAKER_08]: for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it allows them to make
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a good way to analyze the data of
what your patients are using to have a
[SPEAKER_08]: better idea of what your patients are
using.
[SPEAKER_08]: What your patients want and need.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a cool technology.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you mentioned also something else
that's a danger.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here in Germany, you might be
surprised.
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard how expensive the cannabis is here
in Germany.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it's really unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_08]: But things are going to change.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's happening in Canada, we're having
almost people are saying it's like a
[SPEAKER_08]: commodity price.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's right now oil is becoming kind of a
commodity.
[SPEAKER_08]: And some people are saying that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know if anyone can just
quickly talk about how do you prevent from
[SPEAKER_08]: being a commodity?
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, here in Germany, because it
might be unfathomable to you to think,
[SPEAKER_08]: because it's selling for so expensive
here, it might be difficult to comprehend.
[SPEAKER_08]: But here in Canada, the pressure is on the
price to go down.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we prevent that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Any thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think especially in the
recreational market in Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: the provinces are going to have a lot of
buying power.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that it's set up in Canada is the
province is responsible for distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going to be buying from the
licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to build in two sets of margins.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a wholesale margin and retail
margins.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means that the price that they end up
paying is going to be around $2 to $3 per
[SPEAKER_02]: gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just have to look at the alcohol
industry and see that that's the same
[SPEAKER_02]: case.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you buy a $20 bottle of wine from a
provincial retailer, the winery actually
[SPEAKER_02]: gets about $4 or $5 out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're getting 20 or 25% of the retail
price.
[SPEAKER_02]: The estimated retail price in Canada is
about $10.
[SPEAKER_02]: So assuming the same happens in the
cannabis industry, it's going to be at
[SPEAKER_02]: about $2 to $2.50 once the market matures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Initially, there's going to be a lack of
supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that the prices will stay high
for the first year or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: But inevitably, once that oversupply does
hit the market, there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: significant price compression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to have producers that
are just focused on flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to see their margins erode
because they are going to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: price compression, a lot of pressure from
other producers to meet the revenue
[SPEAKER_02]: targets as public companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think the best way for companies
to try to avoid that is to focus on the
[SPEAKER_02]: value-added products, just like Emblem is
doing and ourselves, because we're able to
[SPEAKER_02]: take those input materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as that price comes down, it actually
means that those producers, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: margins are going to erode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our margins are going to increase because
our input costs are going to come down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be able to source from
other producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to be able to supply
everything ourselves for our output.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that positions our companies
very well in that eventual economic
[SPEAKER_02]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we see on the product side,
although the raw input material can get
[SPEAKER_03]: commoditized, we have one producer in
Canada, Hydropothecary, selling a spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the per gram equivalent price
of that spray ends up being about $60 or
[SPEAKER_03]: $70 a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go actually and productize your
cannabis, you get a lot of margin that can
[SPEAKER_03]: be compressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a very interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But certainly, on the rec market,
that's the last place I want to put my
[SPEAKER_03]: product, because you're going to get
squeezed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're getting intermediated with a
wholesaler and a retailer.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first place you want to put product is
the medical market in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's a small market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it goes to really places like
Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: The international medical markets are the
best markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think as Canadian companies,
we're all looking to pursue those
[SPEAKER_03]: international opportunities, because that
is the best opportunity for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just to echo some thoughts you guys
made.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely, to differentiate, you want to
be a higher quality producer, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to have unique products.
[SPEAKER_07]: And another thing that you can't overlook
is you have to have strength in
[SPEAKER_07]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Emblem has a partnership with a very
large pharmacy chain in Canada called
[SPEAKER_07]: Shoppers Drug Mart.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a few other distribution
arrangements.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know Chuck's involved with National
Access that is also focusing on
[SPEAKER_07]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: So having the right retail partners and
the relationships with those retail
[SPEAKER_07]: partners and distribution points,
even though some of them are provinces,
[SPEAKER_07]: is going to be extremely important as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And National Access just signed a deal
with a big coffee shop chain in Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just read that on the news.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's nice to see coffee going to
pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pot of coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and Tokyo Smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would have thought coffee shops?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very popular in Canada, mixing coffee
and coffee.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if they actually mix it
together, but you can do both in the same
[SPEAKER_08]: spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they're going to allow it
yet, but it'll get there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The concept is there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So great discussion.
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt it was really important to leave
time for questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like we always run out of time for
questions, so I wanted to leave a good
[SPEAKER_08]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So open it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it for the panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coffee.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if this translates,
but in America we call coffee and cannabis
tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hippie speed ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yikes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the only meaning for a coffee pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coffee pot is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Picks you up and calms you down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks very much for sharing your
experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yesterday we heard from an importer into
Germany of Canadian product how important
[SPEAKER_06]: it was to have clinical studies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering whether you have any
experience with clinical studies in Canada
[SPEAKER_06]: that could perhaps stand up to the
standard that could provide a medical
[SPEAKER_06]: benefit claim?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will be venturing into clinical
studies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Through our educational arm and clinic
operation GrowWise, we have been doing a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of observational trials and have been
collecting data through the patients there
[SPEAKER_07]: on their experience with cannabis and
different strains they use.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, clinical trials is something
that's going to become more important,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially if you want to export and
especially if you want to really
[SPEAKER_07]: legitimize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis as a drug that's distributed like
other drugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't have any direct experience with
it yet, but it's something that our
[SPEAKER_07]: company will be focusing on in the next
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think certainly there are a number of
institutions and companies working on
[SPEAKER_03]: clinical studies in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one I'm familiar with is that
National Access Cannabis, being a clinic
[SPEAKER_03]: model, direct patient interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clinics in Canada have really been the
ones that have been driving the physician
[SPEAKER_03]: engagement with patients for people to get
access to the medical system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's opiate reduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the anecdotal evidence is pretty
overwhelming on reducing opiates with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those studies, there's a number of
opiate reduction and replacement studies
[SPEAKER_03]: taking place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that will be a huge key.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pain physicians have been the most open to
prescribing cannabis because they know
[SPEAKER_03]: what the alternative is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when those clinical studies get
results, I think we'll see, it'll be a
[SPEAKER_03]: great tool, especially for new markets,
to really break through the medical taboo
[SPEAKER_03]: barrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just started two weeks ago a
pre-clinical trial to study the effects of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid therapy on heart arrhythmias
and Dravet syndrome, so a type of seizure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're just starting that research
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're hoping to get some results by
the end of the year, which will help to
[SPEAKER_02]: guide a more formal clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's already underway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're pursuing a couple of other
clinical trials as well under a few other
[SPEAKER_02]: different disease states.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be coming forward in the next
few months.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chuck, you touched on something,
a big crisis in Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have an opiate crisis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Around 4,000 people died last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's already accelerating this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I find interesting, I'm learning a
lot about the German, that they're very
[SPEAKER_08]: chemical culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of drugs being used in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when I talk about opiates,
it doesn't seem like it's such a problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's something that is
going to happen or if somehow Germany can
[SPEAKER_08]: avoid it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a big problem in Canada and
finding that cannabis can be used as
[SPEAKER_08]: either a complementary or don't use as
much opiates or as a replacement,
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that could be huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: But just a thing I want to point out also,
when people say there's not enough
[SPEAKER_08]: research, because I hear that all the
time, I tell them to go to a website
[SPEAKER_08]: called PubMed, P-U-B-M-E-D, type in the
word cannabis, and notice the 20,000 plus
[SPEAKER_08]: articles of research there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then tell me that there's no research.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's tens of research,
maybe not as what some of you like,
[SPEAKER_08]: but there's lots there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe in collaboration for
research.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope we all can do collaboration.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no point of us investing our own
research because it's going to help us
[SPEAKER_08]: all.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about working together as producers
and then worldwide.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's doing something in Germany?
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's doing something in Toronto?
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we work together?
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen PTSD trials, pain trials.
[SPEAKER_08]: Adam McGill by Dr. Mark Ware, who's doing
some great stuff in Canada with the CCIC,
[SPEAKER_08]: the Canadian Cannabinoid Investigative
Consortium.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really important, the research.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, in a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just want to, to your point where
opiates, and there have been studies in
[SPEAKER_05]: America that in states that have legal
marijuana, opiate overdoses and opiate
[SPEAKER_05]: deaths go down 25%.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they're realizing that cannabis
isn't a gateway to harder drugs,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's a pathway away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to say it's an exit drug,
not a, and also something to point out
[SPEAKER_08]: that not only does opiate use go down,
but suicide goes down, physical abuse,
[SPEAKER_08]: alcoholism.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of other ills go down as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what role do you see for economic
development, economic development
[SPEAKER_01]: agencies?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm from one of the provinces and we've
been very focused on this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just your thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which province?
[SPEAKER_01]: New Brunswick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, great to see New Brunswick here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really taking a leadership role.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met with several individuals.
[SPEAKER_03]: No other province seems to be attending
these events.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's... Any other provinces here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we've got one here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 10 provinces, a few territories,
but I think it speaks to the fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: most of our local governments and
provincial governments are not really
[SPEAKER_03]: engaged on this file.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're being forced by the federal
mandate.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis system started through the
courts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a federal government that is very
pro, or at least that is going through
[SPEAKER_03]: with legalization, but it's a lot more
engagement to be had.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we see actually New Brunswick
providing job grants and hiring grants,
[SPEAKER_03]: really normalizing the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the opportunity is to keep
engaging with government through
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional channels for whether it's tax
credits or other innovation funds to
[SPEAKER_03]: normalize that, but it's a slow process.
[SPEAKER_07]: Through my experience, it really can vary
province to province.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, again, from my experience,
one of the most forward thinking provinces
[SPEAKER_07]: in cannabis is Alberta, and their economic
development teams are quite interested,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially in the city of Calgary,
where they want economic diversity because
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a very natural resource heavy
economy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's very nice to see provinces that
are supporting cannabis and not trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: shut the door or make it more complicated
than it already is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think just going to the European sector,
I think those conversations will be few
[SPEAKER_03]: and far between here as far as dealing
with officials, but I think it's a great
[SPEAKER_03]: time to start building those bridges,
making those connections.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not gonna get anywhere,
but there's far fewer people knocking on
[SPEAKER_03]: those doors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think now's the time to really just
start that process and engaging with your
[SPEAKER_03]: local officials and going back to the
political issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to be known to those officials
when the starting gun goes off in whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: jurisdiction you're in, making sure that
people know you and you've been able to
[SPEAKER_03]: use lobbying or engaging with officials as
a point of credibility to accelerate your
[SPEAKER_03]: business plans.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, lobbying, that's not a swear word.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that needs to be done and
look it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Phil, did you have something to
say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say that I'd really
encourage people to engage their economic
[SPEAKER_02]: development teams within whatever
jurisdiction they're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a very capital intensive industry,
so if there's any help that different
[SPEAKER_02]: regions can offer companies, then that
certainly is very beneficial for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: companies, helps to offset a lot of the
cost, whether it's through some tax
[SPEAKER_02]: incentives, credits and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, it's really great for the
local economies because there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: jobs being created and I think that the
biggest challenge is on the regulatory
[SPEAKER_02]: front, so forging that relationship with
people who are in government and with the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulator can be very beneficial
strategically for your company,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I'd really encourage it for anybody
who's considering it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and New Brunswick, you should be
really proud.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear they're doing some great things
there to support businesses because it
[SPEAKER_08]: creates a lot of jobs and a lot of good
paying jobs, so it's really smart to
[SPEAKER_08]: support these types of businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just quickly, where you're located in
Canada is very important and emblems
[SPEAKER_07]: located in lovely Paris, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, Paris, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't look anything like Paris,
France, but what's important is we're very
[SPEAKER_07]: close to the municipal government there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're very supportive.
[SPEAKER_07]: We couldn't have asked for a better
supportive local government than we have
[SPEAKER_07]: in Paris, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, time for one quick one and
then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, my name is Harry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wondering, you were talking earlier
about one of the challenges being getting
[SPEAKER_04]: capital to grow your business.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the same time, we see market valuations
that recognize we had in the dot com age
[SPEAKER_04]: 17, 18 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your views on the risk that the
money coming into this business is
[SPEAKER_04]: creating a green bubble?
[SPEAKER_08]: Green bubble?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I've heard that one
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that there's a lot of money,
institutional money in the United States
[SPEAKER_02]: and elsewhere in the world that's still
sitting on the sidelines waiting for the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry to develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still in the early stages of the
industry, so there's still a lot of growth
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once that money does come into the
industry, it's going to continue to drive
[SPEAKER_02]: share prices up and continue to appreciate
the valuation of these companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada is positioned very favorably in the
world because we do have access to an
[SPEAKER_02]: export market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just based on our domestic
Canadian market, but we do have that early
[SPEAKER_02]: mover advantage into other markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I still see a lot of upside moving
forward into the years ahead as the
[SPEAKER_02]: companies continue to develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that if you're going to be
investing long-term, if you're looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: short-term picks, then that's your day
trading.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, at the end of the day,
what's important is to pick your horse and
[SPEAKER_02]: to pick your jockeys and support them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't get caught up in the day-to-day,
because everybody is focused on the last
[SPEAKER_02]: month or two how the prices have been so
volatile, but they forget about the
[SPEAKER_02]: run-ups that have happened for the last
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure, there's a short-term trough
where things have come down and corrected
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps a little bit, but the trend is
upwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at the charts for the last couple
of years and they're only going in one
[SPEAKER_02]: direction, aside from this short-term
pullback we've had in the last couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: months.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really see that the upside
opportunity is still tremendous for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's still more solid than
cryptocurrency.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry if any crypto guys out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: There goes my whole pot-coin business.
[SPEAKER_08]: The title already exists.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have more time for questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be around, so feel free to
come up and talk to us.
[SPEAKER_08]: We love talking about cannabis in Canada,
so we're all very friendly guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: So come say hi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for having us here again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hear it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
