[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is David Downs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the California Bureau Chief for Leafly
.com, and I'm the former cannabis editor
[SPEAKER_02]: for the San Francisco Chronicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for joining us this morning
at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: sharp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very proud of everybody here that made
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brave the cold and traffic and flu season
and everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the ICBC for having us down
and for throwing this event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the Hilton for hosting us,
and thank you to the sponsors,
[SPEAKER_02]: including Leafly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to download their app and look
into advertising if you're a dispensary
owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have today here is the most
powerful regulator in California cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: California is the biggest market and the
most influential market here in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the future is happening here first,
you know, again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to explore that future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before I did that, I wanted to put a
quick foundation under what we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love being on the journalism
beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been on it for nine years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because it's so full of these
teachable moments in civics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought I hated civics in seventh
grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Mr. Bender.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it ended up being a passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to run through real quick,
we had Proposition 215 in 1996 that
[SPEAKER_02]: created a patient defense for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Prop 215, 1996.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had SB 420 that followed that expanded
the personal defense for medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: to a collective defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it was not a right.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2015, we regulated medical cannabis
with the McRZA or the MACUSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can figure out how you want to say
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then in 2016, we had Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where the rights kicked in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have personal rights to cultivate
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can applause for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have personal rights to possess
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have personal rights to share it with
other adults 21 and over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have commercial licensing and
taxes and regulations, which were TBD when
[SPEAKER_02]: we passed this in 2016, you know,
set up, you know, with some guard rails
[SPEAKER_02]: like local control and taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kicked off tens of thousands of
hours of public comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys were tracking it,
but it must have been interminable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the state, you know, threw out $100
million to form the Bureau of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: Control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Governor Jerry Brown tapped Ms. Lori Ajax
here, who's known as a no-nonsense,
[SPEAKER_02]: no-drama technocrat from the Department of
Alcoholic Beverage Control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's been a real steady hand at the
wheel of a very turbulent plane that's
[SPEAKER_02]: being built as it flies here in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you look at how far we've come,
it's quite remarkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had commercial sales begin January 1st
in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they began under temporary rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: This January 2019, we've had final rules
come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're starting to take stock of that
last first commercial year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have about 600 stores open in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did several hundred million dollars in
tax revenue last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're on our way to a billion dollars
in annual tax revenue under a full
[SPEAKER_02]: licensed system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but the thing about the BCC,
the Bureau of Cannabis Control,
[SPEAKER_02]: is they implement Prop 64 subject to other
laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't fight local control.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to the farms, that's under a
different agency called the California
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Food and Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to testing or kitchens,
that's under a different department as
[SPEAKER_02]: well, the California Department of Public
Health.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spread power around in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't let it accrete in one place.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the BCC does control stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delivery, distributions, and other points
of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to talk about the future
of those things with Ms. Ajax and Mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Traverso.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please give them another warm round of
applause.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a new milestone kicking in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm seeing it on Instagram these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's people taking photos of their
first annual licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a big deal because you've
never been able to get a license from the
[SPEAKER_02]: state of California to affirmatively like
grow or distribute or do anything with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis until Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those temporary licenses were much
easier to get than these annual licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now annuals are being issued.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the year of annuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to start there and talk a little
bit about the number of annuals that have
[SPEAKER_02]: been issued and some of the biggest
challenges to getting an annual and then
[SPEAKER_02]: how business people in this audience might
be able to prepare so they have a smoother
[SPEAKER_02]: experience in annual licensing this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't issued very many annuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: As probably you know, the Bureau,
I think we're around 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of that is because we have
really primarily focused, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: during November and December, on making
sure we got people their temporary
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that ability for us to issue
temporary license went away at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some good news on that is that in
November and December, we were getting so
[SPEAKER_01]: many applications in December alone,
we issued over 1,400 temporary licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that should be something we all
should be thinking about because that was
[SPEAKER_01]: a big rise in temporary licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that people have their temporary
and they have their extension so they can
[SPEAKER_01]: operate, so that's probably most
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want people out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want them operating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we move into looking at the annual
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of rules, a lot of things that
you have to provide to the Bureau.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's the Bureau, Food and Ag,
or Public Health.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're working on trying to figure out
what's the most challenging things for our
[SPEAKER_01]: applicants and how we can make it easier
for them to comply with our rules and get
[SPEAKER_01]: the documents that we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have the provisionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't forget about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the provisionals?
[SPEAKER_01]: The provisional, we have some,
there was some legislation last year that
[SPEAKER_01]: was passed and we can issue provisionals,
especially in situations where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting for the local jurisdiction to make
a decision on your SQL requirement,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's our environmental requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if there's some other thing that's out
of control of the applicant that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting for at the local level,
we can issue a provisional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think you're gonna see a lot of
those starting to this next year because
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be a little bit easier for us to
issue than the annual.
[SPEAKER_02]: This strikes me as you guys at the BCC
doing your best to smooth over some of
[SPEAKER_02]: this turbulence at a time when the locals
might still be catching up and it speaks
[SPEAKER_02]: to, I'm perceiving this philosophy of
trying to keep things moving as best as
[SPEAKER_02]: you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a philosophy that's going on at
the BCC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I just, I'll jump in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really important and we wanna
underscore the point of how important it
[SPEAKER_00]: is to get people into the market,
get them a license, get them the ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to get up and running and get a sense of
how it is to operate in this newly
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to Lori's point of all the licenses
that were issued, the temporary licenses
[SPEAKER_00]: in December, that was really big for us to
get people their temporaries before the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to get them those ended at the end
of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to have those folks in there and now
getting up and running and getting a sense
[SPEAKER_00]: of how things are gonna work, I think
that's really important for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to dig in real quick, when you're
getting an annual licensing, what tends to
[SPEAKER_02]: be the biggest snags?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it declaring who's on the ownership?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the background checks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a CEQA review if necessary for a
store or distributors or things like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you see consistently coming back
as a snag?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the biggest thing is getting
through the local jurisdiction process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably the biggest hand,
getting through building and planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you have to have a conditional use
permit or a special use permit,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting through CEQA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of the stuff we're seeing on
our end, like getting a surety bond or
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get your fingerprints,
those are just made, it's education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where you go to get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think for us, it's probably the
biggest holdup is at the local level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's stay with the issue of local
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't force a city or county to do
anything with regard to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the total power rests with the city or
county in terms of shaping what kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis commerce it wants to have
locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this idea goes back to before America
was America, when we were a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: religious fanatics founding colonies,
local control was paramount.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before there was counties or states,
the rule was that you could dictate to a
[SPEAKER_02]: large degree what was going on in your
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've seen over the last two years
that a lot of locals have said,
[SPEAKER_02]: we are not prepared for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not trained for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a budget for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we have to do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though a lot of them demanded to be
in the driver's seat for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen this as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what can we do to train up locals?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a way to do a best practices
conference where the state regulators who
[SPEAKER_02]: are really knowledgeable can drive some of
the learnings down to the local levels?
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we get to the point where these
local rules are copy-pastable for new
[SPEAKER_02]: jurisdictions?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's important to mention one
thing before we sort of dig into some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I may have mentioned this when we were
sitting here last year, although,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can't even remember what I did
two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forgive me if I'm repeating myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in 2017, as we were leading up
to January 1, I want to say that we spent
[SPEAKER_00]: about 120 days going to different
conferences and local jurisdictions to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to folks and really get a sense of
what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that what we took back was
that we understood that a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't going to be ready to go on January
1 of 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tried to just reinforce the point
that we were always going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people had questions, comments or
concerns, they could talk to us and they
[SPEAKER_00]: could get in touch with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that has helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think to David's point, I think
there's a lot more to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're working toward that now
with putting into place this local liaison
[SPEAKER_00]: office that we're trying to hire folks for
that can actually work with cities and
[SPEAKER_00]: counties directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think Lori might have a better sense
of the timing on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we're trying to get that
started and up and running because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: such a huge piece of the overall process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we're finding that the
locals are struggling, just as confusing
[SPEAKER_01]: it is for our applicants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also confused on what the
regulations say, what the state is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've just really recognized that we
have to have a lot more outreach.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing a lot of outreach,
but we need to do a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why we've developed this
local liaison unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already hired a manager for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bringing on at least about nine
people that are just going to work
[SPEAKER_01]: directly with the local jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to include some of their
applicants, too, that they are having
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble advising.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to work directly with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're going to have somebody
that they can call directly, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: we respond to inquiries by email.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times, people want to pick up the
phone and get a real person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love your idea of having a best
practices conference because we always
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's going out to Colorado to go to
these conferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we do it better here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should do our own conference here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, the California way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of Colorado, they had an
intergovernmental working group that was
[SPEAKER_02]: in operation for a while designed to play
air traffic controller among all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different agencies because there's a lot
of moving parts here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have something similar in California
yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that maybe on the horizon or is that
being accomplished in another way?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you synergizing with the CDFA,
the CDPH, taxes, you name it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so just to give you an example,
when we would have these sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: intergovernmental meetings every so often
where we'd all get together and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep everybody on the same page with
updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we'd have probably 35 to 40
different representatives in this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the folks that David mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's public health.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's food and ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's CDTFA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also EDD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's water boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fish and wildlife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go on and on down the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Cal-OSHA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all these different agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the coordination is not always easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we've gotten the process down
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always an open line of
communication, especially with food,
[SPEAKER_00]: nag, and public health because we got to
work in lockstep so many times with those
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're doing a pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never as smooth as you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coordination is always tough,
especially when people are so busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we do a pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I've noticed covering cannabis
legalization for nine years is that the
[SPEAKER_02]: California's pace so far is not at all off
pace compared to how other states have
[SPEAKER_02]: gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I look at Colorado, Washington,
Oregon, we saw the same ratio of banned
[SPEAKER_02]: counties to cities and counties that allow
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw the same pace of adoption in terms
of implementation at the local level.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2016, four states legalized cannabis,
Nevada, California, Maine, and
[SPEAKER_02]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We beat all of those states in terms of
implementation and tax revenue taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevada started earlier than us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were much bigger than them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we eclipsed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maine's governor blocked implementation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they made zero dollars on their
legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Massachusetts, you think you guys got
local control problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go back to Mass and see how the games
played back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that said, are you seeing the pace of
implementation improve, slow down?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your concerns there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because on my side, I see medical
dispensaries in places like Point Wyniemi
[SPEAKER_02]: that have never allowed them or Lompoc.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am starting to see things break up,
Emeryville, places that on the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: beat you have never heard of before now
are finding a way to licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think about the pace?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's improving.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing it improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say, but it's not as fast as
we need it to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that because you guys go pretty
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even for the state to keep up with you,
it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think for us, we are just
constantly trying to what more can we do
[SPEAKER_01]: to get cities and counties to embrace
cannabis regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of course, we think if you're
regulating it, that's got to be better
[SPEAKER_01]: than not regulating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we're starting to see that
movement again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we thought it would be at a
quicker pace than it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the bright spots that
have surprised you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Salinas has taken off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa Barbara County has taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I look at part of what I do
is I look so much at the news every day
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think right after November,
after the recent election, I think you saw
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of local ordinances on ballots all
across the state pass, which I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: were all encouraged by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it just depends upon the rate of
implementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot of those folks that are
in cities and counties that had ordinances
[SPEAKER_00]: pass in November were among those licenses
that we were issuing in December,
[SPEAKER_00]: that last push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think people sensed,
hey, this is our opportunity to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: the market under the temporary licensure
and see how quickly we can get up and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, hopefully in 2019, that pace sort
of continues and we see more and more of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are seeing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I think, the encouraging
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to add, I definitely think
having our final regulations in place is
[SPEAKER_01]: helping because before they weren't sure
we kept changing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cities and counties don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like you guys probably don't like it
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think having just consistency is
going to really help things this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any chance that locals will say,
gosh, this seems like a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to defer to the state in
this regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like when you look at alcoholic
beverage control, there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: deference to a state regime and some very
local sort of choose your own adventure
[SPEAKER_02]: type choices you make about time,
place, and manner of alcohol delivery.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's pretty much run at the state
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has there been any talk about locals
deferring to state, or is that just way
[SPEAKER_02]: off the table?
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't heard too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would welcome that, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming from alcoholic beverage control,
full local control has been an adjustment
[SPEAKER_01]: for me because I'm used to, at ABC,
you were the sole licensing authority.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you did defer to the locals for land
use issues, but the state made the final
[SPEAKER_01]: decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we'd welcome that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know, Alex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think more probably took the extra time
to just sort of deliberate what they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if they were going to accept our
rules as written, we would have seen more
[SPEAKER_00]: come online sooner.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was a business owner and I was told I
was in a band town or a town that was on
[SPEAKER_02]: the fence, can you give me one,
two, three action items, things I should
[SPEAKER_02]: be definitely doing locally that are table
stakes things that if I'm not doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can't even be having this conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just civic engagement?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it lobbying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it writing your own initiative?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what are you telling business owners
who want to get this going locally?
[SPEAKER_02]: Move.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, if you want to be in
business now and you're in a band county,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to move, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to stay where you are
because you've been doing that there for
[SPEAKER_01]: many years, it's really engaging the local
jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to see cannabis business
owners run for city council, board of
[SPEAKER_01]: supervisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Cody Bass in Lake Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to mention Cody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys know the story of South Lake
Tahoe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Clap your hands if you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Cody Bass is a longtime activist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's from Plano, Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: His dad was convicted of smuggling.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got like a sophomore high school
education, dropped out, became a ski bum,
[SPEAKER_02]: came to Tahoe, saw Tahoe, said he was
never leaving, worked the chair lifts,
[SPEAKER_02]: got into medical marijuana, grew it,
helped start a dispensary in Berkeley,
[SPEAKER_02]: cut his teeth on regulations there,
opened a club in Tahoe, spent 10 years
[SPEAKER_02]: going round and round with locals over
tiki-tack nonsense.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really raked him over the coals as a
small business owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, Cody Bass ran for city council.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the election day, swept out all the
older incumbents of South Lake Tahoe and
[SPEAKER_02]: went out into his community, learned what
the real issues were, which were fire
[SPEAKER_02]: control and local housing issues with
regard to Airbnb, seized on those issues,
[SPEAKER_02]: not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now Cody Bass sits on the South Lake
Tahoe City Council.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really inspiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: This week, the South Lake Tahoe City
Council voted to pass its local cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: ordinance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cody Bass had to recuse because he's on
the council now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was in the audience advocating for
his business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was a three to one vote to
ensure that that small business has a
[SPEAKER_02]: place in this system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to Cody here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So move on to final regulations,
which are permanent down now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The number one thing that people were
keeping an eye on in them was the
[SPEAKER_02]: non-storefront delivery license type.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this is what we guys know as retail
deliveries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the license type wasn't in Proposition
64.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually came out of Governor Brown's
office during a legislative session.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm never sure why he did this or his
office did this, because he's never really
[SPEAKER_02]: carried much water for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a real revolutionary license
type, because most states, legalization
[SPEAKER_02]: states, there's 10 of them now,
do not allow delivery.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're from the Department of Alcoholic
Beverage Control.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea of driving around alcohol and
delivering it gave law enforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: officials hives for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here we are now with a situation where
there's over 100 delivery services that
[SPEAKER_02]: are licensed to deliver all across the
state now and cut into the lack of access
[SPEAKER_02]: issues in these band towns and provide
taxed and regulated cannabis to the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that voted for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What has been the response to the final
regulations which codified that
[SPEAKER_02]: non-storefront license type?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you take me into not the backlash or
the blowback, but just the reaction to
[SPEAKER_02]: finalizing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think overwhelmingly positive in
terms of the allowance for delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the road was a little bumpy along
the way getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you saw the response from League
of Cities and police chiefs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the overwhelming point was
just that this is what the people voted
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was far too many instances where
I think there was some number I saw where
[SPEAKER_00]: people had to drive on average 60 miles
just to get access to a licensed retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a lot of people, especially
patients, that's not a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that when you look at allowing
delivery, I think it's common sense more
[SPEAKER_00]: than anything else, and that's the
direction it was headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we were a little overwhelmed,
too, that one sentence in over 150 pages
[SPEAKER_01]: of text got the most comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we got well over a few thousand
comments for and against.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from the beginning, we always felt if
we issue any retail license has the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to deliver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we issue that license, trying to
tell that licensee you can only deliver in
[SPEAKER_01]: this area and that you would have to have
drivers try to figure out when they leave
[SPEAKER_01]: that area would almost be impossible to
regulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was our opinion from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we decided we were getting so
many questions we needed to put it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, like I said, very
controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it was the right decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens, because I know
there's still many folks that aren't happy
[SPEAKER_01]: with it at the local level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the final rules were chaptered by the
Office of Administrative Law, which scrubs
[SPEAKER_02]: them for legality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you guys do your homework before
you propose them in terms of whether or
[SPEAKER_02]: not you think it's going to withstand a
legal challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you take us into the legal precedent
that might put us on firm footing for
[SPEAKER_02]: allowing this delivery license type?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the statute itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how we interpret the statute that you
can't prevent delivery on any public road.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's where we're going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what we're going to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a right of way issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, we don't know what the
legal challenge is going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't gotten one yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Bureau won't be defending
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be our attorney general's
office would represent us in something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that maybe there's some new
law that we're in a new legal territory in
[SPEAKER_02]: that it might have to do with what's
delivery, where is the point of
[SPEAKER_02]: transaction, especially now with Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: This issue of the legality of cannabis
delivery at the local level is bigger than
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It relates to online commerce and taxes
and the fundamental limits of police
[SPEAKER_02]: powers and local control in an
interconnected, digitized society where
[SPEAKER_02]: these transactions could be occurring
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm trying to find a question in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess did that come up in the talk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazon, e-commerce, where is that place of
transaction?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any parallel or analog industries
you were looking at here?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's tough because you still can't
deliver cannabis through the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: mail because there's federal implications.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our regs, if you read, we don't let you
do it by drone either.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't drop some day maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in a lot of ways, cannabis
delivery is still by vehicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's similar to Amazon and those
things and those questions came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think for us, it was just simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we give you a delivery license,
you're entitled to go anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_01]: state to deliver your drivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're regulating you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very strict regulations on what a
regulated delivery driver has to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's limits on how much they can carry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to have GPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: The licensee has to know where there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we feel like the public safety is more
safe with regulated delivery drivers than
[SPEAKER_01]: all the unlicensed delivery drivers that
are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the opposition and the
proponents of delivery made for a real
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting mix of strange bedfellows.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw a cannabis union, the UFCW Local 5,
team up with I believe maybe the Teamsters
[SPEAKER_02]: and the police and the league versus
others from who wanted delivery in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also saw local cities sort of mad
that you were kind of messing with,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's face it, some local oligopolies or
limited amount of licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you think is going to lead the
challenge if there is going to be one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a face of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like coming out of delivery,
I haven't heard one major group be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to take the banner up on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to fight this over the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know where the challenge might be
coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we do at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's tough to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we saw the whole wandering weed
campaign and I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really hackneyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very under budgeted and sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cringeworthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say cringeworthy also,
so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they lost their ardor for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, one specific delivery that I
think is going to ramp, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: amplify down through time is just because
locals, quote unquote, maybe not have won
[SPEAKER_02]: this round.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still have a lot of power and they
might do other things to try to check
[SPEAKER_02]: delivery at the local level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you go into the specifics of delivery
licensing with regard to how close you got
[SPEAKER_02]: to be to a market to drop it there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that San Diego was saying
that like, look, yeah, Kaleeva can drop in
[SPEAKER_02]: San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kaleeva is a San Jose brand or was a San
Jose brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have to leave from a licensed
Kaleeva storefront and then go directly to
[SPEAKER_02]: the customer, arguably in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this has to do with a,
quote, ice cream truck model versus a
[SPEAKER_02]: courier model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there, where is going to be the
clarifying points in delivery going
[SPEAKER_02]: forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does Kaleeva need a delivery hub in San
Diego to drop, a licensed delivery hub
[SPEAKER_02]: around San Diego to drop in San Diego?
[SPEAKER_01]: According to the state regulations,
as long as they're leaving from their
[SPEAKER_01]: license premises, wherever that is,
I mean, they can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't necessarily stop along the way
and pick up cannabis somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as they're going straight to
their, they can stop for rest breaks and
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as they're leaving from their
licensed delivery, that can be anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: and they can deliver in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's restrictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't deliver to like a school or a
public building.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to go to an actual physical
residential address.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're starting to see is San
Francisco city attorney just came out with
[SPEAKER_01]: a memo saying that they're going to
restrict delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a license with the city
of San Francisco in order to deliver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe they're not gonna allow what
we call the ice cream truck or the dynamic
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, cities and counties can be more
restrictive than our regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they would be enforcing that on their
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state wouldn't be enforcing something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's just, you're just gonna
see a patchwork of what cities and
[SPEAKER_01]: counties are doing to licensees in their
area and what they're gonna require.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some of them want the tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if Cleveland's coming in from the Bay
Area to San Diego and they're making a
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery, they want that tax revenue also.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like it's to be determined.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna have to actually practice the
delivery license model to kind of suss out
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the more granular limits of it and
how big a barrier cities can erect to this
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of right.
[SPEAKER_02]: For these businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to switch, to talk more about final
regulations, underneath there,
[SPEAKER_02]: underneath delivery, which was the big
one, I'm trying to think of the second
[SPEAKER_02]: most commented item you've gotten.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard a lot about packaging and
childproofing, which has been giving a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of good progressives and environmentalists
heartburn.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the regulation you landed on and
how did you land there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of our proposed regulations,
because you know, last year we had our
[SPEAKER_01]: emergency regs where childproof packaging
occurred at manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we came out with our
proposed in midsummer, we actually
[SPEAKER_01]: proposed that the exit packaging that's
required by statute at retail,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we combine that and say, that's gonna
be your childproof packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be encompassed in the exit
packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a ton of comments on that also.
[SPEAKER_01]: That did not stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Public health is requiring childproof
packaging at manufacture for all
[SPEAKER_01]: manufactured products, including flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a year period to transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that did not, you know, that was
something we proposed that didn't stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're back to childproof packaging as
it originally was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the emergency reg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was, you have a year to get
everything into individual childproof
[SPEAKER_02]: bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until that point, you can keep it in the
exit bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the next year, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sometimes we do try to
uncomplicate things, but it just seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: get complicated again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because we're of the mind, if we can
make it easy to understand and
[SPEAKER_01]: uncomplicate it, it's a lot easier for
people to comply.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much control do you have over testing
in phase three regulations and where those
[SPEAKER_02]: limits are?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that all with the CDPH or were those
fails in the BCC regs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Testing labs is under the bureau.
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally, way back in the day,
it was under CDPH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it got transferred to the bureau.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're responsible for all the testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very challenging, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like very strict testing regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had phase three testing rules come into
effect on January 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything made before January 1st,
you could sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after January 1st, you have to pass
tests not only for pesticides and
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens and purity and labeling,
but you gotta not fail for heavy metals
[SPEAKER_02]: and mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you heard in the early days of
phase three going live?
[SPEAKER_02]: What has been, is it going as planned?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are things failing for?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are things that producers need to
look out for going forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a lot of people were nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: In December.
[SPEAKER_01]: So along with everything else we were
doing, everybody was very nervous about
[SPEAKER_01]: phase three testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were worried a lot of our
labs would not be ready to do phase three
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things we did, we sent our
lab folks and they went and visited every
[SPEAKER_01]: single lab in California to look at their
equipment, to make sure they understand
[SPEAKER_01]: the phase three testing, to see how they
were using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we haven't had any issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of our labs are ready to do phase
three testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They already had the equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got all their staff trained.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't heard too much about it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, still a lot of,
there hasn't been as much phase three
[SPEAKER_01]: testing yet, because a lot of product was
before January 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're continuing to monitor that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, failed batches continues to be,
we have a failure rate of just under 13%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that continues to be mainly for
labeling issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which should make you feel okay,
because it's the cannabinoids labeling
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then probably next in line is
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are, but really way below the
labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think if you notice,
if you were following from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: July up until now, we've got a weekly
report that we send out that you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: access to and have mailed to you every
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see, I think the failure rate
has continued to drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it started at about 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Lori mentioned, it's under 13%
now and it continues to move down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that just shows that the
adaptability and how people are sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting used to the standards and things
are progressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I hear from the industry is
we're seeing a lot of variance in our lab
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're concerned about the quality of the
labs we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that they have until the end
of this year to get ISO certified,
[SPEAKER_02]: if that's correct, under international
standards for how they're operating.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're all allowed to sort of skin
the cat their own way, as long as the test
[SPEAKER_02]: results come out valid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can follow their own sort of
protocols.
[SPEAKER_02]: How confident are you in your ability to
watch the watchers or is that really with
[SPEAKER_02]: the CDPH?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we do work, CDPH has a very cannabis
lab too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do work with them because they're
looking at all the manual, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause a lot of the problems when you see
when things fail at the laboratory is the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really working with CDPH to make
sure that we're looking at these
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're seeing like a lot of failed
batches coming from one manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going in and seeing how they're
doing their manufacturing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's going to get,
that's all going to, that's a process for
[SPEAKER_01]: us and for CDPH and working with the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we're getting through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys have any interaction at the
federal level?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to be doing any lobbying or
do you keep an eye on what's happening in
[SPEAKER_02]: DC this year?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know last year, you know, you said you
got to do what you're going to do and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to do what they're going to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to cross that bridge when
we get to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems like things are building in
Congress for, you know, exempting certain
[SPEAKER_02]: states from the Controlled Substances Act
under the States Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blumenauer just introduced S420 today
because, you know, that's our favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: number.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at Congress, do you just go,
or do you guys engage?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say that we engage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that we monitor things and I think
we definitely pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think more talk at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can be encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always know how much stock to put in
it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thankfully, again, we continue to have
enough on our plate that we're focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: getting our business done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think any time you hear more chatter
about any movement at the federal level,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's somewhat encouraging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something you can endorse at a
state agency level?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we endorse the States Act or is that,
no?
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually, like with our own legislation,
even in California, we stay pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: hands-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't go off until something passes and
we have to implement some of that or it
[SPEAKER_00]: affects our program in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we jump in and take action.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until that time, we stay pretty much
out of any debate about legislation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of California legislation in
2019, what do you hope comes out of this
[SPEAKER_02]: legislative session, if anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some red-hot fixes we need,
if anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you sense any signals from the
governor's office in terms of what
[SPEAKER_02]: direction he wants the legislature to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there's going to be a lot of
bills out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a little bit on labs with the
certificate of analysis allowing for like
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really haven't seen too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really hoping if there is a real
problem with our regulations or something
[SPEAKER_01]: that we would be working with the industry
to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we say final regs, that's not really
final.
[SPEAKER_01]: We expect, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, go figure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, alcohol regs are still
evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they don't change nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean on regs?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know we're going to be doing some
reg packages this year and making some
[SPEAKER_01]: fixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have no fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be out there again with probably,
but it won't be these large regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think they'll go fairly smoothly
because we're only going to be dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with a little bit of the regs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rep Bonta introduced a tax sort of relief
measure into a democratically controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: legislature that is really interested in
raising revenue right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys don't control the tax levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in Prop 64, and it takes a
two-thirds vote of the legislature to
[SPEAKER_02]: amend them.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people in the audience are hoping
for tax relief to drive more people into
[SPEAKER_02]: the legal market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't give that, but do you see other
forces that are affecting prices like a
[SPEAKER_02]: decline in the price of cannabis coming
up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think I can't really speak to
the decline in prices of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as far as the taxes are concerned,
I mean, obviously we saw this bill,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same bill last year, and it's one of
several bills that are going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: reintroduced this year or already have
been reintroduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really speak to whether 11% is
going to make that much more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference than 15% for most operators,
but hopefully it's a start, and I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: saw that bill not make it through last
year basically because I think they looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at what tax revenue was coming in and the
thought process was, well, if taxes aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: at the level that we were expecting,
then why would we cut taxes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can look at that a number of
different ways, but I don't know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be more of an inclination
to make that work this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of it, again, is going to
depend on what we see from CDTFA's tax
[SPEAKER_00]: reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one coming up,
I think, within the next week or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: even a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm definitely going to keep an eye out
on that and see how things progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Laurie, have you seen the CDTFA Q4 revenue
totals?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in their secret squirrel world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called them yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't tell me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said February 14th.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a Q4 revenue, and we probably
raised several hundred million last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a couple hundred million here or
there, and we might end up with real
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, you guys got $10 million to do
some equity type of grants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't seem like very much money,
but I wanted to throw it to you about when
[SPEAKER_02]: can we expect an equity grant application
form to come out and what might be on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we've got two minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be coming out very,
very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I can say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tried to simplify this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have $10 million, which is not a lot,
to provide to local jurisdictions that
[SPEAKER_01]: have equity programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get one license with $10 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tried to make an application process
that's going to be very easy for the
[SPEAKER_01]: locals to apply and us to be able to track
what they're doing with the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hoping this catches on,
and we're very successful for the
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdictions that get this money that
maybe we're going to see more local
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdictions adopting a local equity
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis industry isn't the first one
to face equity problems, and there's been
[SPEAKER_02]: other attempts in the past, small business
loans, minority points on government
[SPEAKER_02]: contracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where else can people look in the state
apparatus for a leg up, if anywhere?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you've been in the state for a
while now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the go-to programs for help
before cannabis existed?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we have to do more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money's great, but I think at the state
level, and we keep looking at this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we reduce barriers to entry to get
people into licenses, to assist them with
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a license?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things the equity program,
the legislation that Senator Bradford
[SPEAKER_01]: passed is, we are going to have four
people that just provide technical
[SPEAKER_01]: assistance to the local jurisdictions that
have equity program and their equity
[SPEAKER_01]: applicant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we need to do a better job of
making sure people understand how to get
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed and we try to reduce those
barriers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also we have to encourage,
we've got a lot of small cultivators that
[SPEAKER_01]: are trying to sell their product through
the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we incentivize our distributors and
our retailers to buy from those equity
[SPEAKER_01]: applicant cultivators?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or manufacturers?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bigger conversation than just the
Bureau.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really engaging the industry with
this and seeing what we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's something we can do with our
regs, how do we incentivize other
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what we're going to
look to explore this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two more questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enforcement's a reality this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your priorities?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just really quickly, if I had the
breaking news, a little music in the
[SPEAKER_00]: background, we just put out a release this
morning about our enforcement unit
[SPEAKER_00]: shutting down an illegal delivery service
in Sacramento and an illegal storefront in
[SPEAKER_00]: Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So activity is happening on that front.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about this a few times,
how 2019 is going to be a year of
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to really get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cannabis enforcement unit is working
with local law enforcement, local
[SPEAKER_00]: governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're continuing to get complaints about
illegal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're following up on all of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think you're going to see more of
this type of activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a public education,
public awareness campaign coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really going to try to get after
those illegal operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Digital messages, not just the cease and
desist letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also really trying to encourage
the consumer to buy from their licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: retail location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that campaign hopefully is going to be
starting sometime early next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll definitely see some things
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things happening pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, guys, we're out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to let you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, but wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have one question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for David and Laurie and
Alex Reversal one more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
