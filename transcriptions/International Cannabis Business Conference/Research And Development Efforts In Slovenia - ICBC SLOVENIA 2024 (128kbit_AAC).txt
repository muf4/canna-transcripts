[SPEAKER_02]: But now, coming up, we're very honored to,
she's going to discuss the research and
[SPEAKER_02]: development efforts in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a plant breeder, project leader at
the Slovenian Institute of Hop Research
[SPEAKER_02]: and Brewing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Assistant Professor
Andrija ÄŒaradok.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for the opportunity to
give a short speech about our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm coming from the institute which
was already named.
[SPEAKER_00]: My field of work is plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the name is of the institute,
we are developing hop varieties and now in
[SPEAKER_00]: the last years we are working on cannabis
research as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor to talk about the research
and development efforts in the field of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in Slovenia and why it is,
let's say, why it was the topic of our
[SPEAKER_00]: institute to work in it because hop and
hemp are the closest relatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both coming, the species,
from cannabis family.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of common things but
opposite as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say that cannabis is really even
more interesting because of some plant
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done much faster and giving a
lot of results in a shorter way than,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, hop as a perennial plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, so plant breeding is one of the
main topics of the institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have developed, so I'm working for more
than 25 years in the field of research and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant breeding and we have developed more
than, let's say, 10, 15, I'm not sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties which are now covering our hop
fields in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are using different classical and
biotechnical approaches together with a
[SPEAKER_00]: university from Ljubljana, biotechnical
faculty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are developing really high tech,
high tech work and methods which can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used in our breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia is the fifth in the world looking
for, if we are focused on hop acreage per
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we are so small, we are in the
fifth place and we are exporting 98% of
[SPEAKER_00]: our crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question is why could not be
the same with the medical cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be the same because we can produce
and we can export even if we are so small
[SPEAKER_00]: and if we cannot drink so much beer,
we can export our hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is the same case with medical
cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 89%, so the same percentage of our
Slovenian hop fields are covered with our
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenian hop varieties which were
developed at our institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really an opportunity for hemp
grown in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are also tightly connected with the,
let's say, experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the group of prime minister to do the,
let's say as much as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: good legislation, base ground for working
in medical cannabis growing and research
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are our fields of interest?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm coming from the research which is
linked more to the agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first is agriculture science and
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very close to the agriculture is
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to be as sustainable as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hemp and cannabis are giving all these
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course medicines, which is not our
topic, veterinary medicine, cosmetics as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, and construction industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore we met some time ago with the
Talman Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we realized that we have the same
fields of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were a lot of business
opportunities, private-public
[SPEAKER_00]: partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm coming from the public institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless our budget is almost,
one half of it is coming from the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a difference comparing to the,
let's say, universities or faculties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we very quickly find that we have some
common things which can be together in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consortium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this consortium was established.
[SPEAKER_00]: We name it CONCAN, so Consortium of
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are including a lot of different
faculties from both universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from Maribor and Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different companies which are working in
the field of cannabis, research business
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are our main topics of
agriculture, environment, sustainability,
[SPEAKER_00]: and medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking for different kinds of
applications which can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collaboration, as I mentioned,
between different Slovenian scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: research organizations and companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is our main topic is to develop
really innovative products from different
[SPEAKER_00]: medical, biotechnology, and new breeding
approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of our, let's say,
working field with the Talman Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years ago we started, let's say,
our PhD thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the colleague has, she has done,
finished her PhD in the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done together with the University
of Ljubljana, Biotechnical Faculty and
[SPEAKER_00]: Faculty of Pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have just looking, working on
outdoor hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were selecting between three
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different chemotypes and genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because these are population varieties,
you can find different plants inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: same population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were looking for different
chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found out some really interesting
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between, in the same varieties,
which can have, let's say, perhaps higher
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, higher CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are really potential to develop
new varieties with the new projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably could be founding of the Ministry
of Agriculture very supporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third, let's say, team is our
institute is working with one German Czech
[SPEAKER_00]: company together with the fact faculty of
pharmacy and the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the allowance to work in indoor
to develop high THC varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of our photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are, let's say, using first
molecular markers to distinguish between
[SPEAKER_00]: male and female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now then we are using our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the chemical lab of Accreditite
for some analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there we are doing different chemical
analysis of essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, cannabinoids, which can be used
later for different pharmacy or products
[SPEAKER_00]: or medical uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, everything is indoor,
protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are, so our main goals are,
of course, as all plant varieties to have
[SPEAKER_00]: high yield, high quality yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in this case, we are looking for
high THC varieties, high CBD, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are all, everything is done in
accordance with the GAP and GACP quality
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compliant with EMA guidelines for hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are using now in this later procedures
feminization, of course, to have the just
[SPEAKER_00]: female so that the seeds which will be
sown can have just, it will be just female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are doing, of course, cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are using tissue culture to conserve
the genotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are doing, as I mentioned,
different kind of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All for this to, let's say, develop
candidate varieties with high content of
[SPEAKER_00]: specific metabolites, which can be used
further, as I mentioned, in medical or
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacy purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the advantages and opportunities
of medical cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: As we all know here, it can be really one
of Slovenian exporting crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, we are exporting 98% of
our hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it is incredible when we get the
reply from the Ministry of Health that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can just have, let's say, a few grams of
medical cannabis in Slovenia because there
[SPEAKER_00]: are just few patients and we don't need
more than just a few grams of it in
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really something ridiculous,
especially if we are looking to just do a
[SPEAKER_00]: simple comparison with the hop industry,
which gave the, it is the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: exporting agriculture crop and it gave the
first mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after the Second World War,
the first foreign money income in
[SPEAKER_00]: Slovenian or in that time, Yugoslavian
parliament.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the advantages?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the great opportunity and
contribution to the economy, increased
[SPEAKER_00]: funds in the state budgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can prevent the black market activity,
as it was mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it can be all done under
controlled conditions with, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: strict regulation, but clever enough that
it cannot stop the business opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are now current shortcomings based on
our knowledge?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really ridiculous that we have to
destroy all of products which are
[SPEAKER_00]: developing in our indoor activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be used for different,
at least research things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have to destroy all flowers with
different cannabinoids and different
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oil compounds because it's
prohibited to use our plant material,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in research and medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a limited number of plants
which can be grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are looking forward to change our
law and to start something more in
[SPEAKER_00]: positive way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to sum up, if Slovenia holds a leading
position in global hop industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we have really distinguishing hop
varieties which were developed at our
[SPEAKER_00]: institute, we have really the top experts
at our institute in some field of work in
[SPEAKER_00]: the global and worldwide scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is really good establishment at our
institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have hop varieties, we have plant
patent in the United States for one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Numerous of them are protected at the
European region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these methods, investments
which were done in hop industry can be
[SPEAKER_00]: really similarly used for cannabis
research and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: From our institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to conclude with this, Slovenia stands
ready to become a world class research and
[SPEAKER_00]: development hop for the cannabis sector as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said your products are male and
female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to know, do you do some research
on both of them or just female?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you do research on male plants too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same with the hop plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have female and male plants there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in both cases, we are using just
female plants to get in crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is interesting because half of the,
let's say, heredity is coming from the
[SPEAKER_00]: male plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we make crossing between female
and male plants, it's the same importance
[SPEAKER_00]: of the male plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unfortunately, because of limited
space and money and everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: we cannot focus our time and knowledge to
the male plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are more focused on the selection of
female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the male plants are still there,
which we have to analyze and look at them
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there another question?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible to make a cannabis that
tastes like beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis which tastes like beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the beer which tastes like
cannabis already.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do both.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there more questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, everyone's so efficient today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the effect of the weather,
probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, sunny weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for Professor Andrea
Cerenac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the ICBC Slovenia Science and
Technology Forum right here in lovely Lake
[SPEAKER_02]: Bled, Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd like to thank our sponsor,
The Laurel Crest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd also like to thank our party sponsor,
Metaflora.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's at the hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shall not be named.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be named, but it's hard to
pronounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.
