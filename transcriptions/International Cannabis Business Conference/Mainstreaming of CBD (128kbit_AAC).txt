[SPEAKER_04]: OK, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, there's a lot of uncertainty in
CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're kind of facing some uncertainty with
the FDA.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a legal farm bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: My three panelists today are going to help
us kind of figure out some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: patchwork of what's going on out there on
the federal level here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's looking at CBD as a big
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everyone in this room has some
connection to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD has sort of popped up in the last few
months as a federal legal ization and farm
[SPEAKER_04]: bill has come around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of us are finding
ourselves now kind of running parallel
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses and trying to figure out how we
take advantage of what they think is going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be a $22 billion market here in the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: My esteemed guests here are David Bramfin.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a super lawyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: His focus is in trademark and IP law.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have a little bit of
discussions around how to protect your
[SPEAKER_04]: business with both trademarks and patents.
[SPEAKER_04]: My next guest is Chris Husson.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris Husson.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he is a business development and sales
operator for Elixenol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are a global distributor of CBD
products, manufacturer, vertically
[SPEAKER_04]: integrated, kind of all over the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then additionally, I have Janek
Schlup.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's from Pure Cannabis Research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys are a Swiss company who are
growing really fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've done a lot in two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just going to give my guys a
chance now to sort of interject.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to introduce themselves and talk
a little bit about their businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So David, why don't you lead us off?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Mitchell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks to Alex and the gang for having
us all here and putting this together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love ICBC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my name is Dave Bramfin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from down the road San Diego,
California by way of New York originally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once upon a time, I was just a
trademark and copyright and innovation
[SPEAKER_03]: lawyer in San Diego with a lot of clients
in all kinds of different industries,
[SPEAKER_03]: electronics, clothing, music, TV,
film, everything you can think of,
[SPEAKER_03]: restaurants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then about 10 years ago, or what I
like to refer to as 70 marijuana dog years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago, somebody kind of clued me in that
this industry was rapidly developing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it dawned on me that I should figure
out how to take my skills from those other
[SPEAKER_03]: industries and apply them to the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started learning everything I could,
got involved with Normal First and a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of other organizations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And little by little by little,
over the last 10 years, we've been helping
[SPEAKER_03]: clients all over the place develop
intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_03]: IP is the umbrella term for copyrights,
patents, trademarks, trade secrets,
[SPEAKER_03]: domain names.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been helping people develop
strategies in this industry for how to
[SPEAKER_03]: work within this complex legal system,
which is very bifurcated and divided.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, my name is Chris Usong.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the director of sales and marketing
for Elixinal.
[SPEAKER_07]: We distribute CBD products in 42 different
countries.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been in business a little over five
years and are out of Colorado,
[SPEAKER_07]: primarily our headquarters, but have
offices in Japan, Europe, and Australia.
[SPEAKER_07]: We primarily focus on developing high
quality delivery systems to make sure that
[SPEAKER_07]: people get high quality CBD in them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've come out with several different new
delivery systems that you can come see at
[SPEAKER_07]: the booth, including microencapsulating
full spectrum oil into a powder.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can mix it into your drink and
completely water soluble up to liposomes
[SPEAKER_07]: and high quality capsules and dog treats
and an amazing new skincare line that we
[SPEAKER_07]: just launched.
[SPEAKER_07]: But primarily what we're focused on is
being an innovator in the market from
[SPEAKER_07]: growing, from production, from quality,
and from testing, and from transparency
[SPEAKER_07]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Janek.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just flew in from Switzerland two days
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Switzerland is the country that's known
for chocolate, the Alps, and more
[SPEAKER_01]: recently, wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cannabis, CBD cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the breeding company and I'm
managing this one, but I'm representing
[SPEAKER_01]: the holding, which is going to be an
interesting topic afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fully integrated holding from varieties
breeding all the way to the sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're selling from Switzerland to the
European Union, but also internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the biggest company in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've started two years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all took off and now we're selling
flowers as cessation products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're selling dietary supplements,
CBD oils, and we're doing white labeling,
[SPEAKER_01]: private labeling, bulk orders worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the story from my side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking forward to this talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the first question I want to start
with is for you two gentlemen who are in
[SPEAKER_04]: the production end of this business.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the audience might be curious
about what products you guys are
[SPEAKER_04]: producing, what's selling well,
and the diversity of products in CBD that
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys work with specifically.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD is, like you mentioned earlier,
just this virgin eating business.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of different products are
still being created out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're focused on is dietary
supplements to help people take it in
[SPEAKER_07]: their day to day life and invest in their
health and find ways to take CBD that fit
[SPEAKER_07]: into their normal everyday life.
[SPEAKER_07]: The powdered or the microencapsulated
powder that we talked about earlier is one
[SPEAKER_07]: of our newer innovations to make sure that
happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just take some in the morning,
some in the afternoon, some right before
[SPEAKER_07]: you go to bed, and take a little single
serving size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mix into whatever you want to
put it in?
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have different flavors throughout the
day, berries, citrus, cocoa, things like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The idea is that it's something that
somebody can add to their protein shake or
[SPEAKER_07]: their oatmeal or their tea or their coffee
on a regular basis and just make it just
[SPEAKER_07]: like all the other biohacking things that
people are doing to find better ways to
[SPEAKER_07]: live and use natural plants to give their
body the information to heal themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for us, we need to distinguish two
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the business to business market,
which is the prevailing market for us
[SPEAKER_01]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the largest producer in Europe,
we clearly go for bulk products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go for private label and white labeling
on the whole spectrum, starting from
[SPEAKER_01]: flower cessation products below 0.2% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice flowers, but they're
federally legal, similar to the farm bill
[SPEAKER_01]: that has passed here in the States.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way to CBD oils and isolates,
terpene fractions, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Switzerland, we're also selling more
dietary supplements to pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having a few thousand points of
sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this sounds like nothing to you
guys here back home for a million people
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there it's also business to customer
and more so these tobacco cessation
[SPEAKER_01]: products with up to 1% THC because in
Switzerland, the law is not like it is in
[SPEAKER_01]: States with 0.3% THC, but 1%, meaning
Switzerland is turning into this hub of
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD production.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different varieties we can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really this cannabis type with low
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have the whole width of products,
started with 50, seen kind of felt the
[SPEAKER_01]: market, testing the waters, seen that some
are really worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others we've dispatched.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk a little bit about some of
the ones you've tossed aside?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the products that you've decided
not to pursue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will resume those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for instance, the CBD infused beer,
since it's considered a novel food,
[SPEAKER_01]: we stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got to wait for the laws to change
to bring us back onto the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're selling candies these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for instance, some CBD paste,
we stopped doing so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just had to focus on a few things
because we're organically financed and we
[SPEAKER_01]: just can't do everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: David, maybe I'm going to circle back to
you and have you talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_04]: how people who are coming into the CBD
space, I know that the USPTO Patent and
[SPEAKER_04]: Trademark Office has had pushback against
cannabis in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does the farm bill mean for cannabis
in the future when it comes to patents and
[SPEAKER_04]: trademarks?
[SPEAKER_03]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know for sure yet exactly what
the farm bill is going to mean because the
[SPEAKER_03]: law in general moves slowly and the Patent
and Trademark Office moves slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, on a good day,
if we filed a US trademark application
[SPEAKER_03]: today, and I'm talking for just this
moment about trademarks as opposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: patents.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the Patent and Trademark Office,
one office, but you can think of it as
[SPEAKER_03]: there's the patent door over here and the
trademark door over there and they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: the same and they don't treat cannabis or
cannabis related products the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we filed a trademark application
today for a brand name, Dave's Naturals,
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to file a trademark application
today for Dave's Naturals for any product,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's cannabis or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I file it today, it's going to sit in a
queue, an electronic queue for a minimum
[SPEAKER_03]: of four months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before a trademark lawyer at the Trademark
Office even looks at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the farm bill was signed December 20th
of last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody filed a trademark application
for shampoo containing CBD that's
[SPEAKER_03]: compliant with the farm bill, let's say,
that's how they described it.
[SPEAKER_03]: For Dave's Naturals, for shampoo
containing CBD that's compliant with the
[SPEAKER_03]: farm bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: They filed it that day or the next day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That application isn't going to be looked
at until ironically 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the earliest and probably longer
because of the government shutdown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we don't know yet, we don't know
capital N, capital K, capital N,
[SPEAKER_03]: capital O, W.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know what exactly they're going
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think, I think, my office thinks,
others of my kind think that they may
[SPEAKER_03]: allow trademark applications for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been prohibiting, they've been
excluding trademark applications for
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that is cannabis, contains
cannabis, or touches cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: such as a testing facility or trimming
equipment, for the better part of the last
[SPEAKER_03]: five or six years.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been very, very prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think that now certain types of
products that contain CBD that complies
[SPEAKER_03]: with the hemp bill, I mean the farm bill,
hemp-derived CBD with less than 0.3% THC,
[SPEAKER_03]: not ingestible I'm thinking, so not
tinctures, not edibles, but topicals,
[SPEAKER_03]: shampoos, conditioners, patches,
where no health claims are made.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be pretty important.
[SPEAKER_03]: May get through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're all in, if you're in this
business or thinking about getting in this
[SPEAKER_03]: business or this industry or this
movement, you're risk takers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're thinking it's time to take some
risks and try these trademark
[SPEAKER_03]: applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wait for four, five, six months?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason we're not more sure is
because although the farm bill seems to
[SPEAKER_03]: decriminalize CBD, the FDA the same day,
the Food and Drug Administration,
[SPEAKER_03]: the same day that the farm bill was
signed, the FDA issued, the chairperson of
[SPEAKER_03]: the FDA issued a statement that
essentially said not so fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's an important distinction
to make there between laws and
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: We passed a law.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now regulators are stepping in to try to
sort of steer the ship when it comes to
[SPEAKER_04]: how that law is interpreted and how it's
executed on a product level.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the big lessons that we've
learned from the FDA and the announcement
[SPEAKER_04]: you're talking about is that you have to
be very careful about making health claims
[SPEAKER_04]: because there are not the studies to back
it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: FDA has its own approval process for that
and that process takes time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think people who are thinking about
running a CBD business here stateside,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's going to be a little bit of
uncertainty from the federal level and
[SPEAKER_04]: ultimately they want you to be really
careful about making health claims.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys have anything to add on that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well I think it's very important what you
just said that federally it's legal and
[SPEAKER_07]: the FDA what they did was mention that now
as a dietary supplement there's a pathway
[SPEAKER_07]: for CBD to become regulatory approved.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they're working with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're working with the Hemp Roundtable.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're working with lots of different
organizations to make sure that they
[SPEAKER_07]: figure all of this out because it's not
that they don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that all the different stores and
people that report to them or ask them and
[SPEAKER_07]: they work with on a daily basis are saying
what do we do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now they're trying to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're all trying to work together to
help them be able to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And each individual state with that
information from the FDA is now making
[SPEAKER_07]: their own different regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this isn't DEA.
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't ATF.
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know they're not coming for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't care about anecdotal
evidence.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not that's not what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think another very important thing
you need to do that you made a distinction
[SPEAKER_07]: on is making claims and making claims is
something that isn't just a CBD thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean the FDA jumps on all sorts of
industries that we all see on late night
[SPEAKER_07]: TV for making all sorts of claims.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's very easy for people in
our industry because CBD is such a
[SPEAKER_07]: powerful thing to go to that low hanging
fruit and start making those claims.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really need to police ourselves now
to make sure that we're all saying the
[SPEAKER_07]: right things and we're all being ethical
and moral not just following FDA and and
[SPEAKER_07]: legal guidelines.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that Nick I know that Nick had some
of the stuff in his presentation prior to
[SPEAKER_04]: this about the WHO and Europe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Yannick you just talk a little bit
about how the regs are different in
[SPEAKER_04]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a different approach European Union
and Switzerland take as long as the
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties meet this point two percent THC
level in the European Union or this one
[SPEAKER_01]: percent in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are regulated in the sense that
it's perfectly legal like any other crop
[SPEAKER_01]: like maize like soy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow it you can sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what claims is concerned the only
limitation is that we are not allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: put claims on CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's ways around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have registered dietary supplements.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to find those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately it's still loopholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with the authorities with
the regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: We founded a syndicate on cannabis in the
European Union to bring forward and to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But currently it's unfortunately kind of
finding the ways through and the
[SPEAKER_01]: loopholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we can do claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we currently refrain from doing so
because the laws change quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it is here with the states it's
with the countries in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be that one day you can sell and
the other day it's over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here in California I think many of
you may know that the dispensary system
[SPEAKER_04]: and the manufacturing systems here do not
allow any hemp derived CBD products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially our state regulators here
on the hemp side are pretty far behind in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of building the bureaucracy and regs
and issuing permits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so many many hemp companies here
stateside are going to different different
[SPEAKER_04]: states Oregon Kentucky North Carolina
where they're they're really embracing
[SPEAKER_04]: this business and trying to fast track it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've also seen if you look at
Oregon cultivation as it as it sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: commoditizes a little bit more a lot of
the farmers in Oregon have been pivoting
[SPEAKER_04]: really hard to CBD because they can move
from a small canopy to hundreds of acres.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been a it's been a boon for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's going to be their
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know they were lobbying to try to export
cannabis out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think that that's a slim chance
of happening but they can produce CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: flower and hemp there and export it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not still stopping certain incidences
where a truck gets pulled over with CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: flower and somebody gets arrested or
because a local cop isn't going to trust
[SPEAKER_04]: your paperwork.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's looks smells quacks like a duck.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's duck to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you Oklahoma right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that kind of stuff does happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there's a lot of really smart
people in the dispensary business here in
[SPEAKER_07]: California and they know what works and
they're making sure their clients get it
[SPEAKER_07]: whether it comes from hemp or whether it
comes from marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: And knowing the difference between the
actual legal definition of what hemp is
[SPEAKER_07]: and the actual botanical or biological
definition of what hemp is and providing
[SPEAKER_07]: what is beneficial to their clients.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's unfortunate that that it seems that a
regulatory system is trying to regulate
[SPEAKER_07]: something they don't understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think it's up to us here in this
room and throughout the state of
[SPEAKER_07]: California to continue to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're providing our hemp CBD product
throughout California.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of our largest states.
[SPEAKER_07]: And while it's unfortunate that most of
the dispensaries can't carry our products
[SPEAKER_07]: currently today we're working closely with
the state of California to make sure that
[SPEAKER_07]: it does.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you can get it at the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get it from your doctor.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get it from the acupuncturist the
coffee shop down the street.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it makes only sense that people going
for what they for what they need should be
[SPEAKER_07]: able to get a dispensary too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you guys maybe talk a little bit
about the different delivery systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that Chris you guys have sort of a
unique play in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you guys talk about some of the other
ways that people are consuming this and
[SPEAKER_04]: where the opportunities are in that
currently given especially given sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: the FDA is sort of talking more and more
about food products and stuff of that
[SPEAKER_04]: nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well Yannick has a lot of different
delivery systems that he's talked about
[SPEAKER_07]: his pre rolls and he's very innovative
over in Sweden and throughout Europe.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're very Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please I'm sorry Switzerland completely my
mistake.
[SPEAKER_07]: Additionally we're working on a lot of
different delivery systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mentioned a few times our micro
encapsulation process.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very proud of our liposomal CBD but
probably our flagship product is our X
[SPEAKER_07]: pen.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the most raw form of of the CBD oil
that we provide in an airless delivery
[SPEAKER_07]: oral applicator that people just love.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that they can get the most natural
version of the CBD product.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we we know that not everybody wants to
take their CBD in the same way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're trying to find different ways to
fit because one of the hardest questions
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm asked as a sales and marketing guy is
what's your demographic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's your ideal client.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well with CBD it's like everybody from
eight to 80.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and trying to narrow that down.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing that by product sets.
[SPEAKER_07]: Finding a delivery system that helps you
know and fits that demographic and that
[SPEAKER_07]: need and filling the needs to make sure
that somebody doesn't have to look at a
[SPEAKER_07]: big giant scary white syringe and say how
much do I take.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know the size of a grain of rice.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so trying to figure that stuff out for
people and help them get really good well
[SPEAKER_07]: thought out delivery systems and products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yannick anything to add there in terms of
your delivery systems and sort of what's
[SPEAKER_04]: what's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes the delivery systems are closely
linked to claims because back home we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not allowed to do claims on CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've experienced from patients
reporting that the say candies or
[SPEAKER_01]: sublingual drops work much better far
better than things they ingest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also what's very important to us is to go
with full spectrum extracts because from
[SPEAKER_01]: experience and from reports these are far
superior in terms of the fish efficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: than the isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's kind of our experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working together with patients in
hospitals more so outside of the European
[SPEAKER_01]: Union because within it's quite difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be bringing new products soon to the
markets not to the states here but anyways
[SPEAKER_01]: we can ship worldwide so maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's more the claims that are limiting
it than the delivery systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get back to you David here for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to talk a little bit about the
difference between the USPTO law and
[SPEAKER_04]: California law when it comes to doing
business as.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the difference between California law
and federal law again keeps us keeps us
[SPEAKER_03]: awake at night trying to figure keep these
things different keep everything separate
[SPEAKER_03]: or understand the differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got the federal system which for
many years on the on the trademark side
[SPEAKER_03]: again on the on the trademark side has
been very restrictive when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: trademarks for cannabis products or
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That contains cannabis or anything that
touches cannabis and I draw that
[SPEAKER_03]: distinction again because people say to me
often well can I get a can I get a
[SPEAKER_03]: trademark registration.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I get a trademark registration for my
clothing product if it has a pot leaf on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the answer is yes it's not the pot
leaf on the product that triggers the
[SPEAKER_03]: refusal from the patent and trademark
office.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the product itself if the product is
cannabis touches cannabis or contains
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can call it you know again Dave's
Naturals not have a pot leaf on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it contains cannabis or is cannabis
it's going to get rejected or you can have
[SPEAKER_03]: a product that has a giant pot leaf all
over it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not doesn't violate the CSA it's
going to sail through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the trademark office has had this
prohibition for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: They in fact have five or six lawyers who
I informally refer to as the pot posse who
[SPEAKER_03]: are specifically assigned to look at all
trademark applications federal trademark
[SPEAKER_03]: applications that appear to have anything
to do with cannabis and they're very smart
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're very knowledgeable and they're
carrying out their job as they are told to
[SPEAKER_03]: do their job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the irony is the reason you can walk
through the patent office door and get a
[SPEAKER_03]: patent for cannabis or a cannabis product
but you can't get a trademark for a
[SPEAKER_03]: product that contains cannabis is because
the trademark law specifically says words
[SPEAKER_03]: to the effect of thou shalt not issue a
trademark registration for anything that
[SPEAKER_03]: is illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that puts cannabis under the CSA and
nuclear weapons in the same category.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas there is no such sentence in the
patent law.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why you can walk through the
patent door and get a patent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we go to California which for years
and years and years and years followed the
[SPEAKER_03]: federal law.
[SPEAKER_03]: No trademark applications registrations
for cannabis products or anything that
[SPEAKER_03]: touched cannabis until January 1 of 2018 a
year ago and the law changed in California
[SPEAKER_03]: and the California trademark unit in
Sacramento now accepts trademark
[SPEAKER_03]: applications for products for cannabis
products or that products that contain or
[SPEAKER_03]: touch cannabis so long as they are
compliant with California law.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to be able to basic.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't ask for your BCC license.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words the state trademark unit
does not ask to see your BCC license when
[SPEAKER_03]: you file a trademark application.
[SPEAKER_03]: They ask you to sign your application
under your trademark application or a
[SPEAKER_03]: penalty or perjury.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll take your word for it and they'll
leave it to litigation later on down the
[SPEAKER_03]: road with a competitor.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you sue a competitor and it turns out
you falsified your trademark application
[SPEAKER_03]: to get your trademark registration the
trademark unit in Sacramento will leave it
[SPEAKER_03]: to the courts to decide whether you
fraudulently got your trademark
[SPEAKER_03]: registration.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can get a trademark registration
in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say make sure you have your BCC
license in your file so you can show that
[SPEAKER_03]: if you ever have to down the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of companies in the
cannabis space with the same name that
[SPEAKER_04]: that's a common occurrence.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see it pretty frequently that some of
the names are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have seven clients in my little firm
that have humbled in their name and we've
[SPEAKER_03]: had to put pictures of the names and the
pictures of the operators like on the end
[SPEAKER_03]: the post office.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to keep them separate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody and their brother wants to use
humbled emerald green can or canna and it
[SPEAKER_03]: creates confusion in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess maybe you might recommend
people go a different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend people go a different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more clever and creative you can be
the better off you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the classic example that I like to use
to help people understand this is Apple is
[SPEAKER_03]: a dictionary word word you can find in the
dictionary that makes it seemingly
[SPEAKER_03]: generic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when applied to computers and small
electronic devices it's unique because
[SPEAKER_03]: apples are not computers and small
electronic devices in the real world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Apple is a trademark for computers and
small electronics is a 10 on a scale of
[SPEAKER_03]: zero to 10 zero being the worst 10 being
the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: However Apple as a trademark for
applesauce or apple juice would be a zero
[SPEAKER_03]: because in that context it would be
generic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to be as clever and unique as
you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mrs. Fields Exxon Kodak Xerox famous Amos
those pro those trademarks those brand
[SPEAKER_03]: names help you identify and distinguish
your product from the competitors product
[SPEAKER_03]: and they stand apart on the shelf and in
the magazines and all your advertising and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're easy to remember and they say
nothing about the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah and then occasionally you might get
lucky and end up being a Kleenex where
[SPEAKER_04]: might be what a Kleenex where your brand
name becomes the thing that it actually
[SPEAKER_03]: although they have to spend millions of
dollars a year advertising that Kleenex is
[SPEAKER_03]: a noun not a verb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah they don't want you they don't want
people going to the store and saying
[SPEAKER_03]: where's the where's the Kleenex aisle.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want you to go into the store and say
where where can I find the Kleenex brand
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I want to switch back to you
Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear a little bit about the
challenges of sort of taking a CBD company
[SPEAKER_04]: global from from sort of I think you know
I think everyone needs to start somewhere
[SPEAKER_04]: but finding global opportunities obviously
is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you sort of talk about your guys's
journey a little bit from from where you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys started and how where you ended up
going global.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks all was founded by Paul Benham
who has been in the hemp industry over two
[SPEAKER_07]: decades.
[SPEAKER_07]: He brought the very first hemp bar to the
UK the nine bar and he's been innovating
[SPEAKER_07]: in the hemp industry and growing in the
industry ever since.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he did a lot of heavy lifting for a lot
of people in the industry including us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when he decided to found the elixir
because so many people wanted CBD five
[SPEAKER_07]: years ago and there was no way to get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we started doing initially was
importing CBD or from Europe.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had to import CBD from Europe
initially because they wouldn't let us
[SPEAKER_07]: grow it here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when they finally let us grow it here
in the United States we quickly moved to
[SPEAKER_07]: be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have farms in Colorado growing it
and it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean you mentioned early risk taker.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was very very privileged to be able to
work with Paul and Gabe who have been risk
[SPEAKER_07]: takers because they saw what good CBD
could do in the world and they saw the
[SPEAKER_07]: impact that hemp can make in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: So by taking those risks and being
innovative and understanding that good
[SPEAKER_07]: will went out they they were invested a
lot of time and took a lot of risks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's been times that you know it
didn't look good for the CBD world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when we went public a year ago January
going through the legal process and not
[SPEAKER_07]: just back filling and you know reverse
merging into an existing company but
[SPEAKER_07]: actually going public on the Australian
Stock Exchange explaining to lawyers and
[SPEAKER_07]: explaining to finance people the risks
that we took importing CBD and creating
[SPEAKER_07]: our CBD and all those type of things are
are challenging you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they gave me a lot of the gray hair I
have today and definitely have been worth
[SPEAKER_07]: it though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every second of it and every minute of it
has been worth it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we all work really hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and are a testament to the work that
the people that came before me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean the very first cannabis trade show
I came to was ICBC a little over five
[SPEAKER_07]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's been it's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess this question is for maybe both
you and Yannick.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you guys compete with the big dogs
if this thing becomes federal legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And well it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when when the when the regs shake out
and we start getting the General Mills
[SPEAKER_04]: into the business or some of these other
major companies coming in like how do you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys how do you guys compete with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you compete with wholesale extracts
and isolates coming out of China.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys just talk a little bit about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't feel so much like competition
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say we started small and we're just two
years old and then we kind of started
[SPEAKER_01]: producing people started demanding we
started growing and there's few things to
[SPEAKER_01]: our success.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was the vertical integration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there was this debate before
whether it's smart or not to be vertically
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this family culture the constant
exchange between the various companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was one thing that helped us at
the same time we've been diversifying and
[SPEAKER_01]: specializing which is near impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was thanks to the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly we have the strategic alliances
to other continents to universities law
[SPEAKER_01]: firms etc etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this kind of helped us sustain in the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's such a large demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's space for many more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to take.
[SPEAKER_04]: We only have about five minutes left so
we're going to open it up for some Q&A.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody wants to try to get in guys
attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm right here man.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it again for Mitchell the whole
panel on CBD which is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like omnipresent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a quick one.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I guess it doesn't matter to you but
when they ban CBD in like New York where
[SPEAKER_06]: you can't put it in food and stuff
anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen a dip in anything or so.
[SPEAKER_07]: He wasn't banned which is a pretty cool
sensational headline on a news article.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what CBD what they're looking to do is
follow regulations that they think are
[SPEAKER_07]: coming from the FDA and not allowing
people to put it into a commercial food or
[SPEAKER_07]: like a cocktail.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the regulation.
[SPEAKER_07]: That they just brought in but you can
still buy all of our products throughout
[SPEAKER_07]: New York and we're still shipping New
York.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're just working through those
regulations and we work really close with
[SPEAKER_07]: the state of New York to help them start
to figure out these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just a knee jerk because
everybody wants to it because the other
[SPEAKER_07]: side of it because you really have to have
a 360 view.
[SPEAKER_07]: New York is also the one to handing out
the licenses to grow hemp everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're handing out licenses to extract
hemp.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know they're really investing in the
hemp community.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're they're just not talking to
each other yet and once they do it will
[SPEAKER_07]: all get worked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like they're fumbling through
interpretation of federal law right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to do their best.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you do you think that the FDA should be
the entity to regulate CBD or should it be
[SPEAKER_06]: left to states or just hippies or.
[SPEAKER_07]: So FDA the FDA is a great organization for
us to be able to work with.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're looking for education to
figure it out and I think the individual
[SPEAKER_07]: organizations in each state absolutely
should be able to figure it out their own
[SPEAKER_07]: too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're working with each one to help
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a giant spreadsheet on each state
and we're always working with them with
[SPEAKER_07]: our different lobbyists and different
organizations to to make sure that they
[SPEAKER_07]: know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I think everyone in this room here
can help also by engaging their lawmakers
[SPEAKER_04]: and regulators.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ever have an opportunity to have
those conversations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's also a deeper need in this
business for data and studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the more that we can convince
our institutions and science organizations
[SPEAKER_04]: and health organizations to study this and
lobby groups and lobbyist groups the
[SPEAKER_03]: better off the better off we'll all be in
the end and rally your mother your father
[SPEAKER_03]: your grandmother your grandfather your
aunt and uncle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that your legislators see that it's not
just a certain demographic that is pushing
[SPEAKER_03]: this but that there are like real adults
in the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Health benefits up and down the entire
spectrum of show hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many have a mother father grandmother
grandmother grandfather who in the last
[SPEAKER_03]: year have said something like oh my
girlfriends and I just love that CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seek the dialogue with everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I guess I guess the point there is we
all know somebody who's benefited from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's not enough for the FDA.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need people to study this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need it to be done the right way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know and when we get there I think the
whole thing will grow better with a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: less pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a quick question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am working with Jetty extracts who's
traditionally been in the THC space.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking to now we're looking to
create Jetty CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my job has been like procuring where to
find distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having trouble finding folks that
are able to actually produce whole plant
[SPEAKER_02]: full spectrum extracted distillate better
that that after extraction has less than
[SPEAKER_02]: point three percent THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know not the dry way but the after.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know like someone like us who's
looking to do like 20 you know kilos a
[SPEAKER_02]: month ongoing you know not only is that a
sourcing issue but also I'm wondering what
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys are seeing in markets like core
power yoga or you know different you know
[SPEAKER_02]: health food stores cafes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're trying to go into the vape route
which hasn't been traditionally as popular
[SPEAKER_02]: as like the tinctures or topicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you guys seeing as far as the
interest in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why hasn't more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why haven't more people done that because
I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like am I missing something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're kind of first to market
to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just love some kind of context from
you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not an expert in this but part of what
I think is nicotine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that has a big big effect on
vaping in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the FDA has made that very clear
too that they see nicotine vaping is a big
[SPEAKER_04]: problem especially with youth usage and
some of these other things that the
[SPEAKER_04]: nicotine and vape pens is powerful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And additionally you know vaping is an
exercise.
[SPEAKER_04]: One hand you've got THC the other hand
you've got nicotine CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a different delivery method that I
think these guys could also talk about in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of all the different delivery
methods that are coming on this space for
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe you guys could add.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I think you're exactly right on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's an amazing market.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you should be going full force
into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that the risk that we talked
about earlier is nicotine but that people
[SPEAKER_07]: are associated with nicotine.
[SPEAKER_07]: But mainly that big hesitation has been
ATF that that product set has to be
[SPEAKER_07]: regulated by that three letter
organization and the CBD industry already
[SPEAKER_07]: has so many other three letter
organizations coming after them that
[SPEAKER_07]: they've been hesitant to pick one more.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's an amazing way to get CBD
into your body and I think you should talk
[SPEAKER_07]: to me after and we'll make sure that we
get jetty because I love jetty sushi.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's let's make sure we get jetty some
good CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic time for two more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi my name is Sean Blackwell and I am
actually from Idaho and I have a I have a
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook page that's called legalized hemp
in Idaho.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually still illegal in Idaho.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we we had a bust in southern Idaho
recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got my face on the news because
people started asking me questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is marijuana as opposed to hemp
because Idaho obviously is not interested
[SPEAKER_05]: in marijuana at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And making it a really great place for
hemp to be grown because there won't be
[SPEAKER_05]: any cross-pollination.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of people don't really think
about that because that's going to be a
[SPEAKER_05]: huge issue coming up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want you to like elaborate on like the
legalization in states like Idaho and also
[SPEAKER_05]: like the fact that it will be beneficial
for a state like that because of the lack
[SPEAKER_05]: of cross-pollination.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're talking about a growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Idaho is what you're talking about
which is it is still definitely illegal in
[SPEAKER_05]: Idaho.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Growing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about that bust in the
green room.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So grow growing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously that's a big source of
income social revenue source of ways for
[SPEAKER_07]: to revive our economy here in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really happy that all these
different states are starting to legalize
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love Idaho to grow it because
finding areas like Idaho that have land
[SPEAKER_07]: that you could easily serve to certify
organic to grow is hard to find because
[SPEAKER_07]: there's lots of states that are legalizing
it that don't have hardly any land that
[SPEAKER_07]: you could certify organic because they've
been growing tobacco or cotton or all
[SPEAKER_07]: sorts of things on it that have GMOs and
pesticides and things in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd love Idaho to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're absolutely working with the Hemp
Roundtable.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working with the Hemp Industrial
Association.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working with all sorts of
organizations to help move those laws
[SPEAKER_07]: along.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's only a matter of time
before it happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for doing the work that
you're doing there and just hang in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to it's going to happen soon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me ask too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guy I'm over here sitting down my feet
hurt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to his point about cross-pollination
like I'm all for Idaho growing hemp
[SPEAKER_06]: because you know we grow pretty good weed
out here in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want your boys and our girls as
a.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll laugh.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a good joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: You understand what I'm talking about
because hemp pollen can fly up to 30 miles
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes and if you got a recreational
grow five miles from a hemp grow all of a
[SPEAKER_06]: sudden you got problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so please please legalize hemp in
Idaho and Nebraska so they can grow it and
[SPEAKER_06]: we can just grow good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is sort of bringing it back to
basics a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a lot of people don't really
know what CBD is versus cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: general market outside this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering if there is any effort
to educate people out there in the public
[SPEAKER_00]: as to the benefits of CBD not on a brand
level but on a basic level so that people
[SPEAKER_00]: can go out there and look to buying it and
actually know what they're buying it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe to give you some insight how we've
done it back home is we started with a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis farm and we've grown cannabis
publicly meaning cannabis as low THC and
[SPEAKER_01]: people could just walk in there were
information banners we've been giving
[SPEAKER_01]: tours to police to to the government etc
etc.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that it's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how we've got this media
coverage to to represent CBD make people
[SPEAKER_01]: realize what its benefits are how they can
use it might be an approach you can go for
[SPEAKER_01]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other speakers one is from Switzerland
Ben from Canada trade that will give you
[SPEAKER_01]: more insights on the whole regulation and
Swiss market European market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might want to stay put with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely we're all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working on education on our end as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working with lobbyists we're working
with hospitals we're working with colleges
[SPEAKER_07]: working with states to make sure that
everybody understands that CBD is an
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing product and that hemp is the
difference between the biological
[SPEAKER_07]: definition from hemp and the legal
definition of hemp because you know I
[SPEAKER_07]: think earlier you said the difference
between CBD and cannabis which is not
[SPEAKER_07]: really the case.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD comes from cannabis obviously in the
CBD that we sell comes from cannabis and
[SPEAKER_07]: it's the legal definition of hemp which is
a cannabis plant that has less than point
[SPEAKER_07]: three THC in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we sell that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking about the difference
between industrial hemp which is really
[SPEAKER_04]: much pretty much a beanpole that is really
used really grown for its stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like breeding dogs in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a chihuahua.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all the time we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hear it once again.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a fantastic and enlightening panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
