[SPEAKER_00]: And coming up to discuss and analyze
Germany's recent cannabis policy changes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the founder of KFN Law Office,
and kind of a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of our lawyer over here,
all the way from Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for Kai Friedrich Niemann.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'd pick him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, thank you ICBC team for setting
this up here and for inviting me here,
[SPEAKER_01]: for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I started to visit my first cannabis
conference back in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that time, the first CBD products
came up, and nobody really knew how to
[SPEAKER_01]: handle that from a legal point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took a deep dive into that,
and I started to blog and publish some
[SPEAKER_01]: articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, I was invited to the
M.J.
[SPEAKER_01]: Besteli Conference in Toronto and became a
member of the International Cannabis Bar
[SPEAKER_01]: Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since 2017, we got a whole set of new
regulations, which I want to introduce you
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first of all, let me say the new
regulations are in place since April this
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a big relief went through the country,
a big relief, starting with the
[SPEAKER_01]: prosecutors, the judges, the police,
and at least the consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a really, really good
decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so far as we have all wished,
but it's a big step and a big relief in
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a very good development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will take a look at the details
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see here different products,
CBD gummies, edibles, chewing gums,
[SPEAKER_01]: beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last product we saw was the CBD
oil, but as a cosmetic mouth care product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come to that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hype of CBD, the CBD market is
definitely over.
[SPEAKER_01]: The enforcement of the novel food
regulations since 2019 was pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBD oils are no longer on the market
as food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the shelves of the big retailers
withdraw all these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it is mainly marketed as a
cosmetic oral care product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is also very, very small numbers
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw still partly prosecution on the
ground of the narcotic ads.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, that stopped now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get a new law for these products
as well, which I will explain later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the important thing is these
applications for approval as novel food
[SPEAKER_01]: are on the way, especially the application
of the European Industrial Hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: Association, the IHA.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did 80% of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the final results are expected in
2025.
[SPEAKER_01]: The toxicological studies are on the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big study starting in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_01]: With 400 participants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we expect that the authorization by
the EU Commission will be granted at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of 2025 for full spectrum products a
little bit earlier for isolates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, you can market CBD products
again as a supplement and as a food
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was this one study from
Belgium, a cosmetic study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they found out that CBD has an
antibacterial effect in the cavity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the new mouth care product 2.0,
as they say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the reason why companies
started to distribute these products as a
[SPEAKER_01]: cosmetic oral care spray with hemp leaf
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had two decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who confirmed that this distribution way
is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in Hamburg, even in the Court of
Appeal confirmed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one in Dusseldorf.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, as it is, it's not food since
absorption through the oral mucosa does
[SPEAKER_01]: not represent absorption through the
gastrointestinal tract.
[SPEAKER_01]: No application of the novel food
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also depends on the expectation of
the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you write on the product,
it's only for the oral care, then the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer will respect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the confirmation of the
court.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have other court decisions in
Berlin, in Munich, and in
[SPEAKER_01]: Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg saying exactly the
opposite thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very hard to comprehend that,
to get through this with logic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the situation that you can
distribute these products in Dusseldorf
[SPEAKER_01]: and in Hamburg, but not in the rest of
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the authorization as a novel food is
indispensable for the CBD market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we won't be able to revive this
market again.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, you see this here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other problem is, which came up the
last two years, is the pharmacological
[SPEAKER_01]: effect of CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was one decision from the
Cologne administrative court saying that
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD oil should, in principle, be medicinal
products, even if under dosed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, it was 18 milligram CBD
recommendation intake per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the news came from the FSA from
the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came from 70 milligram per day daily
intake, and now recommend 10 milligram CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: intake per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it would be a medicinal
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the European Court of Justice
explicitly says that you need to exceed a
[SPEAKER_01]: significant threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to prove that in every case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this decision is against CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's against European court decisions,
against European law.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we will have to take a look on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will probably be in the courtroom
again with this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, the results of the novel
food application from the IHA will be
[SPEAKER_01]: taken into account as well, just finding
out that this is safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, then we have the other CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have flowers and hemp leaf tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a great demand, very popular in
Germany, CBD flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are all over the place, from the
south of Germany to the north of Germany,
[SPEAKER_01]: sold in kiosks, in petrol stations,
in supermarkets, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the law enforcement deems CBD flowers
as a narcotic, due to a possible risk of
[SPEAKER_01]: intoxication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Police raids and court sentences against
traders happen on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, still right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem is that in Annex 1 of the
Narcotic Act, and now in the Carcange,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Consume Cannabis Law, there was
this clause that a misuse of intoxication
[SPEAKER_01]: has to be ruled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you intoxicate yourself with hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone has any idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, the High Court of Germany,
the Federal High Court of Justice said,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you bake 15 gram, of CBD flowers into a
cookie, and decarboxylate it, bake it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then eat it, there may be the chance
that you can intoxicate yourself with 50
[SPEAKER_01]: milligram of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you have to pay 150 euros for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to eat this brownie then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the consequence of this
expert saying in 2001 of these cases that
[SPEAKER_01]: this might be possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, all the police raids
and all the sentencing took place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we get a new law.
[SPEAKER_01]: The draft is already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The associations can take part in a
hearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's scheduled to come into force at
the 1st of January, 2025.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this law will delete these misuse of
intoxication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, big, big progress for the whole
sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had farmers confiscating, or we had
prosecution officers confiscating whole
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp fields because of this clause.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really, really about time that
this will stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBD flowers and hemp leaf tea will be
freely marketable after the 1st of
[SPEAKER_01]: January, 2025.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, it's 0.3, not like 1.3 like
here in the Czech Republic we heard,
[SPEAKER_01]: or what you guys are introducing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have such a low threshold for
THC, the practice was that the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: from Switzerland, they have 0.5,
0.6, 0.7, too much for the German market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did they do?
[SPEAKER_01]: They washed it down in washing streets
with solvents and added.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that, you wash away as well the CBD
and the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a product which is like
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You raped the plant, so to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you add artificial terpenes and
CBD again on the product so that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: a smell and that you have CBD on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you sell it in the German market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is unbearable practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to stop somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please think about better genetics
because the consumer wants these butt-like
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't get that with 0.2 or 0.3,
with the European variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need another variety, like 0.5,
0.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this product shouldn't be on the
market in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see how this will develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to lawsuit for two clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sued the federal government of Germany
on the grounds of the free movement of
[SPEAKER_01]: goods principle because the CBD flowers
are legal in Austria, Belgium,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Luxembourg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said if they are legal there,
they have to be legal in Germany on the
[SPEAKER_01]: grounds of the free movement of goods
principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: These lawsuits are pending at the
administrative court of Braunschweig right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the law comes in effect at the 1st
of January, these lawsuits are obsolete.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I talked to the judge, and he's
thinking about having a hearing this
[SPEAKER_01]: autumn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe this decision comes first or the
change of the law comes first.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, conclusions.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD oils, extracts, isolates are not
marketable as food.
[SPEAKER_01]: No CBD infused edibles, beverages,
gummies, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD oils as cosmetic oral care products,
partly marketable in certain regions of
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany, if correctly labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the novel food authorization by
the EU Commission indispensable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marketability of CBD flowers, we will see.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD cosmetic and CBD e-liquids are
marketable if no health claims are made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot to, yeah, here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to write on the label with these
oral care products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not suitable for consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to spit it out after certain
seconds and do not swallow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you have to label on the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty silly and not good for
marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, then we have HHC as well on the German
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very popular, two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually it was stopped in June this
year due to an emergency requirement of
[SPEAKER_01]: the new psychoactive substances act.
[SPEAKER_01]: So HHC, H4, CBD, THCP, they are all banned
now by federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the new cannabinoids are already
there, 10-HHC or 10-hydroxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you can't win the race against
the development of new semisynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You better take the Czech route,
as we learned this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulate them all or regulate all
non-international regulated substances or
[SPEAKER_01]: products in a special law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't push it into the illegal market
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Issue licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care of prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care that the traders are obliged to
give information material, prevention
[SPEAKER_01]: information, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is the better way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because you can't win this race.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with Katom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not very popular, unlike in the Czech
Republic.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to Kannafest in Prague,
you will see Katom everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are selling it in the booth on the
grounds there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the reason why the Czech
Republic is taking care of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good that they have this approach
with these new Cyclomotor Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: We suggested that from the organizations
to the Ministry of Agriculture to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: same and the Ministry of Health in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how this will develop if the
Czech Republic makes progress on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, then adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we started in November 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new coalition came into place,
and the coalition negotiations took place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, we are introducing the
controlled distribution of cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: adults for consumption purposes in
licensed source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a complete commercial route was
intended for all these esteemed goals like
[SPEAKER_01]: health protection, child and youth
protection, product quality, and illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: market and crime displacement.
[SPEAKER_01]: What came out was what we see now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were several legal problems along
with this legalization, especially the
[SPEAKER_01]: Single Convention, the mother of all evil,
which restricts the trade of cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific and medical purposes,
Article 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were several solutions to solve
these international obligations,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a respectful noncompliance,
which Canada does, unscheduling of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, very unlikely, a manment via a
simple procedure, also highly unlegal,
[SPEAKER_01]: but could trigger useful political debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most popular was the termination
of the Single Convention and the
[SPEAKER_01]: reaccession with the reservation of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what Bolivia did for COCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the model what we saw the
German government would do for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these intersemmortification
procedures, then you can negotiate trade
[SPEAKER_01]: deals with Canada, for example,
that you can modify the rules of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Single Convention, inter partes,
and start trading cannabis, recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was too complicated, too much
time, too much effort involved,
[SPEAKER_01]: too much diplomatic and political issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the German government decided not to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the European problems is Article 71 of
the Schengen contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is only relevant for trans-border
situations, so not really a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this Article 2 of the framework
decision, Ginrich also talked about this
[SPEAKER_01]: morning, and saying the same like the
Single Convention, only for scientific and
[SPEAKER_01]: medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Ginrich pointed this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Article 2, number 2, exclusively for
their own personal consumption as defined
[SPEAKER_01]: by national law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this rule, or this black letter law,
was interpreted like this, that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: have two columns, column 1 and column 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Column 1 is decriminalization of 25
program possession in public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 50 gram at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Homegrown of three living plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvest limited to 50 gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Successively harvesting was one phrase in
the reasoning of the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know about cannabis, you know if
you have to harvest, you have to harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole plant, and you can't
successfully harvest the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very silly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis cultivation clips for
collective home growing, because they are
[SPEAKER_01]: privileged under a UN agreement and EU.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: No edibles allowed, no extraction allowed,
except of CBD, but hashish and live rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is because our health minister,
Carl Lauterbach, was in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: and always heard the stories of little
kids and child having to go to hospital
[SPEAKER_01]: because they were eating edibles with THC,
because their parents didn't secure that
[SPEAKER_01]: properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he said, no edibles, but wasn't
thinking about that you can have live
[SPEAKER_01]: rosin, with high concentration of THC as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see it's not so easy to set up
logic and sound cannabis law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Column 2 model projects, we'll see in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see here, details column 1,
cannabis handling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost everything is still forbidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's forbidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So possession, growing, producing,
trade, import, export, to obtain cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: or to dispense or distribute cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have your own harvest of 50
gram, and you give 50 gram to your
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbor or to your friend, criminal
offense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use your cannabis for a fat
extraction at home to produce cookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: not allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fat is an extraction, is a solvent,
not allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Criminal offense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we have these exemptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very, very restrictive approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to find your way through that
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the consummation bans in public
areas, 100 meter from kindergartens,
[SPEAKER_01]: playgrounds, prohibition of consumption
near children and minors, also for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a real disadvantage in comparison
to the former illegal situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And numerous new conflicting panel and
fine regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sexy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 45 paragraphs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they are contradicting
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This law needs a re-haul very,
very soon to make it sound again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis possession, consumption,
still stigmatized by this law.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have seeds and clowns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds were deemed as a narcotic ever since
in Germany, not like in Czech Republic or
[SPEAKER_01]: in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the new law took over the definition,
the international definition for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: means the flowering or fruiting tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only if you have flowering or fruiting
tops, it's cannabis in the sense of the
[SPEAKER_01]: law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quite easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the cannabis is not flowering,
it's not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can trade it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can legally trade it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can give it away to a colleague or
friend or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happened then is that the seed
importation for homegrown cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: clips from within the EU is possible,
as seeds are not listed in the single
[SPEAKER_01]: convention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also domestic commercial trade is
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's clear by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's not possible to produce seeds,
because as long as the seed is at the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, it's cultivation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have a license to do so
unless you are a cultivation club,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are not in operation right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a miracle, the seed is separated
from the plant, and you have a legal
[SPEAKER_01]: product because it's not cultivation
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't import it from third
countries because the EU law forbids that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't import hemp from third
countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to have a special
permission, and you have to talk to the EU
[SPEAKER_01]: Commission, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they somehow have to appear in the
European Union.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they are legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the clones is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a couple of seizures of clones from
commercial traders because there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: very misinterpretative reasoning to the
law, which says if you cut the cuddling,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant it in, then it is a seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this moment, it's cannabis again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in the reasoning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was taken over into a law commentary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was the reason for police to go
after clone traders again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so obviously wrong because the
definition is clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is no flowering top, it's not
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have to see how that will work
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in fact, in principle, we have two new
legal products on the market, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some more details of column one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the cultivation associations go
through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bureaucratic overkill for cannabis
clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 280 applications right now in
whole of Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple handful were granted
authorization already, but under
[SPEAKER_01]: reservation because the prevention
officers haven't been appointed yet
[SPEAKER_01]: because there were no courses for these
prevention officers, which they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: fulfill, which they have to do,
because they weren't offered yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think this cannabis association
model will be a success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if a couple of clubs next year
will be able to put some products on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a handful, I guess, but not really
on a large scale throughout Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, this was driven by over
complying with international and EU
[SPEAKER_01]: obligations and healthy policy alimism by
the Federal Health Ministry rather than a
[SPEAKER_01]: human rights and justice approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the model project.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a bit of confusion the last
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the city of Wiesbaden,
together with other cities, announced that
[SPEAKER_01]: they will apply for model projects without
a new law defining that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The government in the first place said,
we want a new law.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want these aspects being covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to have an institutional
legal framework for model projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Switzerland does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the framework in place,
you can't have a model project,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's see how they will do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The situation will be clear, will develop,
will turn out in the next couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: months, three to four months, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we saw in the Netherlands and in
Switzerland, the phase from the first idea
[SPEAKER_01]: of a model project to the real
implementation of the model project took
[SPEAKER_01]: five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are far away from implementing model
projects, even if we get a new law and a
[SPEAKER_01]: proper framework which implements that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never be boring and always something
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 26 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Peter Homburg this afternoon
talking about metal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I will skip that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm open for questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, takeaways.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD market stays complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: No real changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: New legal products, seeds and clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And medical has a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw skyrocketing prescription numbers,
skyrocketing import volumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the year, I will be
surprised what kind of numbers and the
