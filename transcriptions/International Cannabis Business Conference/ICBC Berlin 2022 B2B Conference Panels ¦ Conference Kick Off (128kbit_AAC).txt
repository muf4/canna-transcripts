[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know who I am?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your good con-science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the good con-science of this
conference and I think that might be the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why Alex always wants me to speak
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go home and tell people and maybe
your kids if you care about what they
[SPEAKER_00]: think about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all about money, it's not all
about business.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was at least one guy, some kind of
in blue, who has been proven in more than
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 years of activism that he's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out there for the money,
looking for big business, looking for big
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collected a lot of money, spent it for
legalization, reached kind of legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the development we have seen in
Germany and so it was a business and much
[SPEAKER_00]: sense conference kind of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to jump again unless I've
seen lots of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giving a shit on that kind of politics and
bringing society forward and spending some
[SPEAKER_00]: of your money for your task.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's understandable in the first
look from the economical perspective why
[SPEAKER_00]: should you spend money for others,
for society or something if you are in
[SPEAKER_00]: charge for your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've also seen a lot of companies
coming here to Germany, spending a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money to bring their name between the
people, become well known, having bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: plans, investing money in Germany and then
seeing well it was not like I thought that
[SPEAKER_00]: end of 2017 you'd have 100,000 patients in
Germany and the whole legalization train
[SPEAKER_00]: is not going that fast forward as I
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 10 years now since Colorado made
that decision for legalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years and we have still only two
countries in the world that legalize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not your plan, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not why you are here, that you are
here because you see perspectives and you
[SPEAKER_00]: are here because you see fast development
of that cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also in your interest to spend
some money for politics, for activists or
[SPEAKER_00]: for your industry association,
bringing the political situation forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, well, you should take a lot of
time to wait until it happens on kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: loan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also in the interest direct of
your company because it makes good karma
[SPEAKER_00]: to spend a little bit of your money for
since.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care much about the company names
and I don't know of them, of the names
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're changing anyway all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the American companies I know
one, that's Dr. Brunner because I heard
[SPEAKER_00]: they spend a lot of money for things that
make sense and not just for their direct
[SPEAKER_00]: advertisement in soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spend money for sense and there's
another companies doing that like ICBC,
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex Rothschild is one of them who
understood that, taking care about
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization in Germany or Trotz and
Bickel, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example of a company that brought
us forward also here for legalization in
[SPEAKER_00]: Germany and people in Germany know that
this company did something good for the
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just call you again, be a little bit
Dr. Brunner and support your collectivist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
