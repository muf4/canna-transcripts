[SPEAKER_03]: And now to deliver our keynote speech.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you just sat down, but now you have
to get back up again.
[SPEAKER_03]: The chief scientist for Lumiere Lab and
Osano Bio Group, the keynote speaker,
[SPEAKER_03]: please put your hands together and welcome
Dr. Lumiere Hanoush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Lumiere Hanoush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked with cannabis since 1970.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked 20 years at the medical faculty
of Palatsky University in Olomouc,
[SPEAKER_02]: Czechoslovakia.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the time in hospital, we treated
patients with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was from 1955 to 1990.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that year, 1990, Professor Meschulam
invited me for one year to Jerusalem for
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 33 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be in several days, exactly 33
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was more or less successful,
and so I stayed another year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's 33 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But during that time, I also was several
times at National Institute of Health in
[SPEAKER_02]: Bethesda, Maryland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was in NIDDK.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kidney, yes, and there is a rush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over there, I did research of
hibernation of grounds walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we studied concentrations of
endocannabinoids during hibernation of
[SPEAKER_02]: this grounds wall, because as you can see
later, it's very important for certain
[SPEAKER_02]: human problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which can be treated because they are
influenced by endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they are influenced by
endocannabinoids, it means that they will
[SPEAKER_02]: be also influenced by cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, concerning sleeping,
it can be a stivation during summer that
[SPEAKER_02]: animals won't protect from dry season.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we talk about hibernation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's in the winter, when it's
short day, it's low temperatures and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not enough food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So animals enter a stage which they called
hibernation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also it's a lot dark and it's quiet
because the nature is quiet and it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: important for hibernation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Concerning hibernation, so through
hibernation, other nitros over there are
[SPEAKER_02]: eaten, marmots, grounds walls,
hedgehogs and other animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they enter this stage because it's not
enough food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So during summer, they eat a lot of food
to be fatty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this fat later during hibernation,
they use like source of food for their
[SPEAKER_02]: body and at the same time, it's also
protection this fat against cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they hibernate from time to time,
they awake just to check themselves if
[SPEAKER_02]: there are not some parasites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they won't eliminate some waste
from the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they won't eat, like you
know the squirrels, they collect food for
[SPEAKER_02]: winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also very interesting is black bear in
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not exact hibernator because drop of
temperature is about only between five and
[SPEAKER_02]: six degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this bears, they sleep almost six
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during this hibernation, what is
surprising that there is no increase of
[SPEAKER_02]: porosity of their bones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also they don't use any water and they
don't have any kidney problems because
[SPEAKER_02]: urea when accumulates, so it can be toxic,
but they can work up it to other compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: used to nitrogen for proteins and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So scientists studied such bears.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's complicated because when they sleep,
they can awake when you touch them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's special method, how to prepare
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found that these bears can
survive without any problem and it can
[SPEAKER_02]: help if you solve this problem,
how they do it, help to people which has
[SPEAKER_02]: chronic kidney failure so they can be
treated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they check also bones, tibia,
it's lower part of the leg bone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they saw that nine months old grizzly
and six months later, there was no
[SPEAKER_02]: increase in porosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hibernation protect them because all
metabolic processes goes down up to 98%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Concerning these bones, so it's about 19
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought me bones from mice and
wanted, this was tibia.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the bone which they use from bears
to check porosity and femur.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they told me check if there are some
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I analyze it and I found that there is
very small peak, as you can see,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost invisible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in green.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I analyzed this peak and we had
spectrum just to, it didn't run in GC,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we prepared the derivative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it ran very nice and we found that
this is cilated to AG, to arachidonyl
[SPEAKER_02]: glycerol.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was second endocannabinoid which was
discovered, this isolated Professor Shimon
[SPEAKER_02]: Ben-Shabbat at Professor Meshulam
Laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also participated but I did binding
studies because at that time, Dr. Bill
[SPEAKER_02]: Devane already wasn't over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he teach me how to do it, so I did
binding studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that to AG stimulates bones to be
stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was proved and there is also patent
from Professor Bap and Meshulam that when
[SPEAKER_02]: they use to AG with animals, so as you can
see, bones were stronger because there was
[SPEAKER_02]: less porosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is very important to AG
endocannabinoid which can protect not only
[SPEAKER_02]: animals but also it might be workable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also it will be very useful for human
being.
[SPEAKER_02]: And endocannabinoids concerning bones
because there are osteoclasts and
[SPEAKER_02]: osteoblasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are cells which decompose bones and
build bones, so this we call bone
[SPEAKER_02]: remodeling and it goes all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bones which you have before are not the
same bones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have just all new bone cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this endocannabinoids, this already
know everybody that CB1 is in reproductive
[SPEAKER_02]: system and brain and in bones are CB2
because it's in immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back to the hibernating animals,
what is very interesting that they drop
[SPEAKER_02]: breath, if they breath 200 times per
minute, it drops 100 times to two breaths
[SPEAKER_02]: per minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And heartbeat from 200, it drops just only
two beats per minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important that here is
hypothermia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature goes really strongly down and
it protects and also all metabolic
[SPEAKER_02]: processes goes up to 98% down.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see marmots, this is probably
also here in the mountains in Slovenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at least in Slovakia we can see
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the temperature of the body drops from
31 to only 5.6.
[SPEAKER_02]: And respiration, what I said, respiration
drops down 25 times and heartbeat drops
[SPEAKER_02]: down 25 times and also brain activity
drops down about 90%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the world champion between hibernators
are arctic brain squalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature of the body it's unbelievable
decrease from 37 to minus 3.1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Minus 3.1 it's like frozen meat,
yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nothing happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They survive without any problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after hibernation stay there again,
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And solve all these secrets of hibernation
can help solve some life-threatening
[SPEAKER_02]: situations in human being.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to understand hibernation,
they hibernate six months but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: impossible six months because they can
die.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each two weeks temperature goes up,
it's extreme energy and they stay about
[SPEAKER_02]: one day on the top and then they again
hibernate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during this one day they check if they
don't have parasites, eventually they eat
[SPEAKER_02]: or they eliminate waste from the body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's repeated regularly up to the end
of hibernation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see down these dots, this is
temperature of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they stay somewhere, so they are
sleeping in the factor at minus 10 without
[SPEAKER_02]: any blanket or anything so they can
survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is one day when temperature goes
up and again down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are ground squalls what we
studied.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are again animals which can
hibernate about half a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during hibernation again goes down as
heartbeat, as frequency of breath and
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolic rate also decrease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cold and dark and everything together
help them survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these pictures, these are these 13
ground squalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is like human in the fact when we
look on the situation which is in the body
[SPEAKER_02]: of this squall, it's like human which
suffer a stroke but they have not any
[SPEAKER_02]: problem and what they found that blood
doesn't clot, that there is a reach of
[SPEAKER_02]: ascorbic acid blood, what can be
interesting for human being and other
[SPEAKER_02]: white cells are going to hide in for that
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything help them survive cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if human could hibernate, so body
temperature should drop to five degrees as
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see heartbeat three per minute and
breath in one per four minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's impossible but we can learn it and
use it by different way to help human
[SPEAKER_02]: beings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now concerning our study at National
Institute of Health, we studied brain
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of hibernating, non-hibernating and
regular squalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-hibernating, this was at four degrees
centigrade and regular this was at room
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are very, very wild so we need
special gloves because they can bite you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as they hibernate,
and we studied several endogenomics
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds, anandamide, nolidine ether,
2-HG, oleamide, oleol, etanolamide,
[SPEAKER_02]: this deuterated anandamide, this was like
standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when hibernate, this ground squall
because it's cold four degrees so they are
[SPEAKER_02]: like from refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are like ball and when you catch
them, they cannot protect themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometime happened that some wild
animals find them underground and eat them
[SPEAKER_02]: because they cannot protect themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I keep it one hour in my hand and open
slowly one eye and it takes about three
[SPEAKER_02]: hours to be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we studied several part of brains.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was specially Professor Palkovich
from Hungary which separated for us this
[SPEAKER_02]: part of brains every time on the spot at
NIH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was cerebellum, limbic forebrain,
amygdala, hippocampus and hippothalamus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to the results, the most interesting
was 2-HG.
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks that this is very important
endocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can see, RT is room
temperature, for this is four degrees and
[SPEAKER_02]: HIV is hibernating.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were in cage at four degrees,
but not all start to hibernate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them stay regularly but at four
degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this even this cold influence amounts
of the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, 2-HG in comparison with
room temperature and this four degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shall talk about like four degrees it
means which live at temperature four
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was significantly different in
cerebellum and similar it was also in
[SPEAKER_02]: limbic forebrain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not like cerebellum but still it
was significant for three stars limbic
[SPEAKER_02]: forebrain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we studied also 2-HG in amygdala.
[SPEAKER_02]: In amygdala still you can see that
significantly higher concentrations of
[SPEAKER_02]: 2-HG were at hibernating squalls.
[SPEAKER_02]: From other compounds, we studied
oleoethanolamide.
[SPEAKER_02]: In cerebellum, you can see that at squalls
at four degrees and hibernating,
[SPEAKER_02]: it increased significantly in comparison
with room temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last compound, all
endocannabinoids which we studied,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm talking about this which were the
most significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oleomide, this is called sometimes
sleeping factor in limbic forebrain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see that increased significantly
when they were at four degrees and also at
[SPEAKER_02]: hibernating.
[SPEAKER_02]: We studied also oleomide in all compounds,
but oleomide in plasma was the most
[SPEAKER_02]: important and in comparison with regular
squalls at room temperature, you see that
[SPEAKER_02]: this oleomide significantly increased.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably these are the most important
endocannabinoids which protect with other
[SPEAKER_02]: protection factors of course these ground
squalls to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our interest was also concerning some
compound which we would like to call
[SPEAKER_02]: hibernator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tried to find which compound has
highest changes and this is part of
[SPEAKER_02]: chromatogram and we found that this
compound which is in blue, that
[SPEAKER_02]: significantly decreased.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tried to identify this compound and
on the left is nolidine ether.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of endocannabinoids which we
isolated at Hebrew University.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tentatively identified this compound
like homogamalinol, glycerol.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is one double bond less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, it's the same as nolidine
ether.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, we didn't have somebody who
can synthesize this for us to prove that
[SPEAKER_02]: it fits 100% because only analysis and
spectra, it's nice, but we like every time
[SPEAKER_02]: prove it with real compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is result from this our studies?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we understand molecular mechanism of
bone mass maintenance in beers,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it can lead to prevent osteoporosis at
chronical and especially hospitalized
[SPEAKER_02]: patients because they stay in the bed so
that it goes very fast, osteoporosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This information that just kidney drops,
urine in kidney drops by 95%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be very important to treat
people suffering from chronic kidney
[SPEAKER_02]: failure and understanding how body
temperatures are tolerated by squalls,
[SPEAKER_02]: may facilitate that organs for
transplantation, we can store more time
[SPEAKER_02]: because sometimes it's for long distance
so it's a long time so it can be safer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Molecular mechanism of tolerance of blood
flow because it's blood flow is very low
[SPEAKER_02]: so it can also give us hints for treatment
of ischemia and then during hibernation
[SPEAKER_02]: blood flow, as I said, drops down up to
98% for several weeks and identification
[SPEAKER_02]: of this molecular mechanism can again help
us protect from injury due to stroke or
[SPEAKER_02]: heart attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are very important thing and I
would like to tell you, it will be at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end what I wanted now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So extreme survival, this matrix of
hibernation of animals and occasionally
[SPEAKER_02]: human as I show you directly and it can
overcome life threatening injuries.
[SPEAKER_02]: That human body also can fight against
cold like animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I show you three unbelievable examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is more but I choose three.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Norway, one radiologist, she did cross
country with friends and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: crossing river so breaks ice and she fall
exactly was as you can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't take her up because also
they can be under ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she found some air bubble and was
fighting for minutes for life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then she finished and she was more than
hour in this icy water.
[SPEAKER_02]: No breath, no heartbeat, more than hour
and her body temperature when they brought
[SPEAKER_02]: her was only 13.7 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: She survived.
[SPEAKER_02]: They treated her and they hit slowly blood
outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took it outside and back and she
survived.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Canada, at two at night, a small girl
and accidentally she opened door and went
[SPEAKER_02]: outside to snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was minus 20 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Parents found her.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was more than hour already without
breath, without heartbeat and had 21
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took her to hospital and the next day
they treated her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next day she was okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is very interesting, this hibernating
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: One man went from France, from region
where usually are not people.
[SPEAKER_02]: He fall and broke his pelvis and he
couldn't move so stayed one day and then
[SPEAKER_02]: he lost consciousness and they found him
after 24 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was temperature 10 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was without food, without water,
had no pulse almost, organs had all almost
[SPEAKER_02]: shut down and body temperature was only 20
degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took her to him to hospital.
[SPEAKER_02]: He survived without any problems after
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Human body has possibilities but we must
find, we must study it and find these
[SPEAKER_02]: possibilities concerning hibernation,
what really can help in treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Professor Mesulam, which unfortunately in
January we celebrated his 90th birthday.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was 22 and he was perfect and then he
became sick and in six weeks he died.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that there is almost any
physiological process which is influencing
[SPEAKER_02]: the body by endocannabinoids and he said
that whatever THC does, anandamid also.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only add that cannabinoids can do
whatever endocannabinoids do and in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids they mimic endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can see that during this
hibernation, examples of life threatening
[SPEAKER_02]: situations which can be treated at humans,
that we should study it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know only another one publication
appeared after us which studied this
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Endocannabinoids in hibernation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can really help humans to treat
these serious problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for your attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: We may have time for a few questions does
anybody have a question there's a question
[SPEAKER_03]: right here here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Hello Roman from the Faculty of
Health Sciences I would just like to maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: if you give us a follow-up you show them
that you found the molecule which is
[SPEAKER_00]: Responsible for hibernating and you said
that nobody isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any follow-up any progress on
that specific molecule?
[SPEAKER_02]: On this specific molecule I don't have
progress because when I finish at NIH So
[SPEAKER_02]: we didn't have anybody to synthesize it so
I and I was forced to return because we
[SPEAKER_02]: had Project in Jerusalem, so I couldn't
stay longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I returned again for months and we studied
it so we came to decision that this Is the
[SPEAKER_02]: compound which I showed you So we have to
look into it if somebody else did it It's
[SPEAKER_02]: still open But probably it's this compound
and so it will be probably also
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid Are there more questions
or here I'm closer
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any idea or hypothesis of what
the anandamide does what is its function
[SPEAKER_01]: in the hibernation because it was so much
increased You know anandamide It's very
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the best compound from
endocannabinoids I isolated even more
[SPEAKER_02]: active compound, but because anandamide
Was the first one So it's such studied.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is like active was THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody studied THC and here was
Anandamide so everybody studied anandamide
[SPEAKER_02]: and then they studied 2-HG why 2-HD and
not docosa Tetroenol ethanolamide which I
[SPEAKER_02]: isolated and which was more active because
2-HG is different chemistry because one
[SPEAKER_02]: time it's amide One time it's ester.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is why they wanted to study
Different chemical nature of the compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is why these two compounds are mostly
studied and we thought that the main
[SPEAKER_02]: function in organism is protect humans
from stress Why we name it anandamide
[SPEAKER_02]: there are two reasons ananda is bliss
delight and Dr. William Devane studied
[SPEAKER_02]: ester philosophy and they found that in
Sanskrit ananda is bliss delight So he
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to name it anandadine When you
isolate it, we shall call it anandadine He
[SPEAKER_02]: said because he was specialist in
molecular pharmacology and all my isolates
[SPEAKER_02]: he tested for activity so we did it
together because One without the other one
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was perfect cooperation and When we
identified it Professor Meshwalam said ah,
[SPEAKER_02]: but chemical nature also and it was
arachidonoid ethanolamide So this was
[SPEAKER_02]: ananda.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was amide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was anandamide and why bliss
delight because it should express
[SPEAKER_02]: happiness of discoverers and expected
effect That is in organism compound which
[SPEAKER_02]: makes you happy or which beats your stress
[SPEAKER_03]: You're saying that can't weed makes you
happy, which is great No one's gonna come
[SPEAKER_03]: over this is this is no let's hear it for
no everybody he's helping he's got the
[SPEAKER_04]: nice shoes Hello fascinating presentation
So curious, so the final closing
[SPEAKER_04]: statements of endocannabinoids and
cannabinoids having a high crossover
[SPEAKER_04]: effect What is your proposed study?
[SPEAKER_04]: How we can start seeing the effects of
cannabinoids and endocannabinoid systems
[SPEAKER_04]: since like you said Everyone jumped on THC
because it was the first there's so many
[SPEAKER_04]: potential sub compounds to study What's
the framework that you're looking at?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that exist?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it need to be done?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the future look like in this space?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know in the fact when I Was forced to
enter pension because you can work in
[SPEAKER_02]: Israel only to age 68 So I work at the
University at 69 you are head of
[SPEAKER_02]: department what I wasn't you can stay for
good Up to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so I finished at 69 and I came to to
the company which wanted to treat
[SPEAKER_02]: endometriosis With cannabis, so we studied
endometriosis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really Very interesting because about
between 10 and 11 percent women in
[SPEAKER_02]: productive age Has endometriosis some of
them don't know that it's endometriosis
[SPEAKER_02]: because it can take longer time to Find
that this disease is endometriosis and
[SPEAKER_02]: probably I am NOT going to talk about that
because you probably know all this science
[SPEAKER_02]: From which we understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Israel, I know one physician He
treated with cannabis several women miss
[SPEAKER_02]: endometriosis and he was successful so
this is field Which is very interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately this company As we say
Coronavirus aid aid them so this
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory Doesn't continue because they
didn't have money because of Corona so
[SPEAKER_02]: This At the moment it's in the ice it's
waiting to continue when will be more
[SPEAKER_02]: favorable situation They also moved from
here in Jerusalem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very complicated to travel travel
every day three hours To the left.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so What happened this happened and
study of cannabinoids, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: the most interesting study should be real
Cannabinoids it means real cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: are acid cannabinoid acids, of course and
they study the carboxylase and the
[SPEAKER_02]: carboxylase of these real acids are for
canopy generally can be chromatic
[SPEAKER_02]: tetrahydrocannabinoid cannabidiolic and
also cannabidiol Cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_02]: tetrahydrocannabinoid and cannabichrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the main compounds which are
studied because they are in highest
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrations and Sometime we must find
how how to give it to the patient because
[SPEAKER_02]: if you imagine that concentrations of
Monandamide if I knew that I never start
[SPEAKER_02]: to isolate it the concentrations are
nanograms per gram What is nothing?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was no when I isolated for the first
time and I evaporated it so glass tube
[SPEAKER_02]: this was clean there was nothing when I
dissolved is nothing and we Build the way
[SPEAKER_02]: and tested it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was active.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's very low concentrations and
We saw effort at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have half milligram.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was enough for identification half
milligram.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was huge amount when you imagine so
probably cannabinoids when they are used
[SPEAKER_02]: so also Very small amounts in the fact are
used by the body All everything is lost
[SPEAKER_02]: because some time people use grams of
cannabinoids and and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so it's still even when now thousand
publications I cannot check everything
[SPEAKER_02]: before I sense Snail mail and I had all
reprints today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's impossible Even you cannot download
all papers every week is between 1 and 300
[SPEAKER_02]: papers on cannabinoids and
endocannabinoids So if you rest one month,
[SPEAKER_02]: so then you have Almost 2,000 papers
sometime.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it takes me two days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just only go go through these papers and
to find what is important so, of course it
[SPEAKER_02]: must be studied because Cannabinoids mimic
endocannabinoids and not everybody of us
[SPEAKER_02]: has Endocannabinoid system in next enough
strong to be diseases somebody has disease
[SPEAKER_02]: but Endocannabinoid system fast returns to
homeostasis then is balancing organisms
[SPEAKER_02]: and your health Sometimes organism is not
enough strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you must use cannabinoids to help to
the person so and there is so many
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases that Discuss it is not such easy
and why is so many diseases which can be
[SPEAKER_02]: treated because endocannabinoid system and
Cannabinoid receptors are one of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: spread receptors in human body.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find it almost Anywhere that is
why it worked with so many diseases Thank
